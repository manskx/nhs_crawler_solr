They are given to both people with care and support needs, and also to carers. A personal budget or direct payment will be created after an assessment by social services. If the council decides that you need any kind of support, you will receive a personal budget and can choose a direct payment instead of letting them arrange services for you. If you aren’t able to, or don’t want to manage your own finances, it''s possible for another person to manage the direct payments on your behalf. Direct payments Direct payments are voluntary, and you need to request or agree to have one. You can’t be forced to have direct payments. If you decide to have direct payments, you can change your mind about this at any time. If you no longer want direct payments, contact your local social services and ask them to arrange services instead. Click on the links below for more information: Why choose a direct payment? Who can have direct payments? Consenting to direct payments Managing your direct payments Employing people and using agencies Managing direct payments for someone else User controlled trusts or independent living trusts (if someone lacks capacity) Why choose a direct payment? If you need care and support, this had in the past been provided direct from your local council. Direct payments were introduced to give people more choice and control over how their care and support was arranged, to help them live more independently. The direct payment is paid to you by the council so that you can decide how you want to meet your care and support needs. Many people choose to employ their own personal assistant, although there are many other ways direct payments can be used. The full control over care and support that direct payments enables is an attractive option for many people. However, some people may be unsure whether they want or could manage a direct payment. In these cases, the council can provide you with a mixed package of care. A mixed package of care may consist of a smaller direct payment, with some care and support arranged by the council or a provider. This allows people to try out direct payments, before deciding whether to move to a "full" direct payment. Who can have direct payments? In most cases, if you or the person you''re looking after are assessed and social services decide you need support services, they must offer you the option of receiving direct payments to arrange care and support yourself, instead of having it arranged for you. If you want a direct payment, but do not wish to manage it yourself, a “nominated person” can receive the direct payment and manage it on your behalf. If a person lacks capacity to request a direct payment, an “authorised person” can request a direct payment and manage it on their behalf. There are very limited situations when social services don''t have a duty to offer direct payments. This applies to: certain people who are subject to mental health laws; in this case, social services can decide whether or not to offer direct payments offenders who are required to undergo treatment for drug or alcohol dependence If someone is assessed as being eligible for support and it''s not possible for them to get direct payments or they do not want one, social services must provide care and support directly, or through an individual service fund. Consenting to direct payments You have to be able to consent to direct payments to receive them. To give consent, a person doesn''t have to completely understand how direct payments work. It is enough that a person understands that direct payments would give them the opportunity to make choices for themselves. Giving consent is not the same as being able to manage the direct payments alone. If someone is capable of giving consent to have the choice of direct payments, they may still need support to manage the direct payments. Managing direct payments The council should set out your obligations and responsibilities in a direct payment agreement that you may be asked to sign. This could include: keeping records and accounting for how the money is spent to social services taking on the legal role of an employer if you''re using the payment to pay for a care worker; talk to the council about local organisations who can help manage the administration and other responsibilities of being an employer Direct payments can only be spent on things that will meet the assessed needs of the person. If you spend a direct payment on something that doesn''t meet your needs, social services can recover the money from you or terminate the direct payment agreement. Everyone who gets support from social services should have their care and support plan reviewed at least once a year. If someone''s needs have changed, they should contact social services to request a review of their care plan. If needs have changed in a way that affects the details within the current plan, the council may conduct another assessment of needs, or a financial assessment. Social services can charge for care and support. This means that you may need to make a financial contribution towards your personal budget amount. Your local social services must tell you if you''ll need to contribute, and how much, and this will be detailed in your personal budget. Their charges must be in accordance with the law. Usually, the council will subtract any charge you need to pay from the personal budget amount, rather than asking you to pay. You should be able to get help managing direct payments if you need it. Contact your local authority''s social services department to find out what assistance they provide. Social services may give help directly or through a local direct payments support service. Local voluntary organisations may also be able to provide tailored support, and Disability Rights UK has specialist expertise in direct payments. Employing people and using agencies GOV.UK has tips on employing someone if you decide to use your direct payment to hire a person directly. If you get direct payments and recruit a self-employed care worker or contract with an agency, you won’t have the responsibility of being an employer. You can find out whether someone is self-employed or if they count as your employee by using HMRC’s employment status indicator online tool. You may still need advice on, for example, recruitment, taking references, background checks and insurance. In some situations, employing a family member to provide care or administrative support may be an option. However, the council needs to agree it is necessary for you to use direct payments to employ a spouse or partner, or a close relative you live with. For example, during the care planning process, you may explain that only the family member could fulfil the role – for example, for religious or cultural reasons. If you choose instead to use an agency for your care services, they will take on many of the employment responsibilities. When choosing an agency, you''ll need to decide what sort of service you''re looking for and the tasks you need help with. It''s a good idea to contact more than one agency as they may offer different types of services. You can find out about local home care agencies by: asking social services getting in touch with direct payments support services contacting the UK Home Care Association speaking to other people who get direct payments contacting the Care Quality Commission, which regulates all care providers Find out about having care at home. Managing direct payments for someone else If someone doesn''t have the mental capacity to request direct payments, it''s possible for an “authorised person" to request the direct payment and take on responsibility for them. This will usually be a carer, family member or friend. An "authorised person" getting direct payments on behalf of someone else who lacks capacity must: act in the best interests of the person who lacks capacity make sure that the person has as much input as possible into decisions that affect them let social services know as soon as possible if it seems that the person might be regaining the mental capacity to make their own decisions Contact social services if you want to find out about managing direct payments for someone you care for. Find out about assessing whether someone has mental capacity. User-controlled trusts or independent living trusts User-controlled or independent living trusts are a way for people who don''t have the capacity or ability to manage their own direct payments to get support from people close to them. Trusts can be set up to help manage direct payments, but they can also manage other money, including social security benefits. A trust is a legal commitment that creates legal duties and responsibilities for the trustees (the people who have agreed to manage the trust). The trust deed is a written document that contains information about the trust. It has to be signed by the trustees and countersigned by independent witnesses. The trust deed will name all the trustees and the person for whom the trust is being made. It will spell out the purposes of the trust and the powers of the trustees. Trustees could be carers, family members, friends, neighbours or professionals. The law says there must be a minimum of two trustees, but it''s better to have at least three. Above all, it''s important that the trustees are committed to the person for whom the trust is made and have a good knowledge of their needs. You can get advice on setting up a trust from Money Advice Service. HMRC also has advice on setting up a trust. Trustees need to think very carefully about their liability for any loss to the trust. The trust deed should contain an agreement that if, for example, the trust suffers a financial loss, the trustees won''t be personally liable. This protection for a trustee would not apply if the loss were caused by the trustee in a deliberate or fraudulent way.

The Care Act and what it means for me Media last reviewed: 30/09/2015 Next review due: 30/09/2017 Your carer''s assessment may identify that you need a break from caring from time to time. Equally, the person you care for may also want to have a break without you. See Accessible day trips and activities for help planning their trip. Replacement care and respite care Replacement care is designed to replace the care that you, as a carer, would normally be giving the person you care for. It may be needed so you can look after your own health and wellbeing, and to take a break from caring. For example, it may be that regular replacement overnight care is needed so you can catch up on your own sleep. In certain situations, respite (temporary) care may be provided by your local authority after your carer''s assessment or after the person you care for has had an assessment. You can use the directory of local carers'' services to find your nearest local carers'' centre or respite service. Your local authority or local carers'' centre can give you information about local support. Carer''s tip from Scope "Some hospices provide respite care; we have found this very helpful. They offer high-level care, which means you can feel comfortable your family member is being cared for properly." Breaks for carers After your carer''s assessment, you may agree with your local authority that you need a break as part of your support plan. If the local authority has agreed to fund the breaks in your care plan, you should be able to choose how you can get your break. Using direct payments to get time off caring After your assessment, if you are eligible for support, your local authority will develop a support plan with you. This will include a personal budget, which you can choose to have as a direct payment. For example, you may choose to:  hire a care worker through an agency so you can go on a shopping trip use the direct payment to pay for a supported holiday for both you and the person you care for – the Short Breaks Network can provide more information on this Alternatives to direct payments You may also want to consider funding or getting a break from caring by: asking for care organised by your local authority getting funding from a benevolent fund or charity paying for a break yourself accessing bursaries and low-cost holidays getting leisure discounts asking friends and family to help Replacement care provided by the local authority Instead of a direct payment, you could ask the local authority to arrange services for you so you can have a break. You can also use a direct payment to fund traditional forms of respite care, and you can pool your direct payments with other people''s to fund services such as day centres. Some local authorities provide vouchers (sometimes called respite grants, or carers'' grants) that can be exchanged for services, such as those offered by care agencies or residential homes. You might be able to use vouchers to pay for extra costs associated with your holiday, including live-in care workers, short-stay residential care, or the cost of more homecare. You might want to consider: homecare services – these can either be day services that give you the chance to do an activity inside or outside the home, or night services that can help you get a proper night''s sleep, or helpers coming to the home of the person you''re caring for. Different types of help can be organised, including sitting with the person you care for and keeping them company, preparing meals, and helping them to get up, washed and dressed. The care workers who come to your home can also provide social activities, such as taking the person you care for to the cinema, pub or shopping. residential or nursing care – this is where the person you''re looking after goes for a short stay in a residential or nursing home. If you can, visit the care or nursing home beforehand so you can see what it''s like.  day care – this is where the person you''re looking after goes to a day centre or takes part in activities away from home. If the replacement care provided is essentially a homecare service for the person needing care and allows you to take a break, it should be considered a service provided to the cared-for person and should therefore be charged to them, not you as the carer. Find out more in Carer''s assessment. Benevolent funds or charity funding You may be able to get help with the cost of going on holiday – either alone or with the person you care for – from a charity or benevolent fund. Your social worker, GP, health visitor or local carers'' support group can give you more information on local benevolent funds and other possible sources of funding. You might find help from the following: Saga Respite for Carers Trust provides a limited number of free holidays each year for carers over the age of 50 and the people they look after. The Family Fund can provide grants towards the cost of holidays for families on a low income who are caring for a child with a severe disability. The Family Holiday Association is a UK charity providing breaks at holiday sites, or grants to help with the cost of a holiday, to low-income families in need of a holiday away from home. You need to be referred by your social worker, GP or health visitor, or by a charity or other welfare agent. The Children''s Country Holiday Fund provides respite breaks in the countryside for young carers aged 6 to 16 and disadvantaged children and young people. Paying for your own breaks If after a carer''s assessment the local authority decides it will not fund a break for you, you can still decide to pay for your own break from caring. How you go about this will depend on your budget and the care options available to you locally. Bursaries and low-cost holidays Some charities offer low-cost holidays or bursaries to families. The national charity Diabetes UK offers support holidays for families and young people. Holidays are low cost and a bursary can be offered to families who can''t afford the travel costs to the UK holiday site. Further information can be found on the Diabetes UK website or on 020 7424 1000 (ask for the care support team). Turn2us, an independent charity, can help you find sources of financial support based on your particular needs and circumstances. Saga, the organisation for people aged 50 and older, has a range of holidays and short breaks to suit carers, including group holidays, holidays for single travellers, special interest holidays, and cruises. Holidays are run throughout the year in the UK and abroad. Saga also offers free holidays for carers through the Saga Respite for Carers Trust. Leisure discounts Many local authorities offer leisure cards. These can help you pay for activities you might like to do when you get a break from caring. They''re often available to people claiming benefits such as Income Support, Employment and Support Allowance, Carer''s Allowance and benefits for disabled people, students over 18 in full-time education, and people over 60. The eligibility requirements vary between areas, but there''s a good chance you''ll qualify if you''re a carer with a low income. Local authorities might make a small annual charge for the card, from £1 up to around £15. You''ll probably be asked for some proof of your entitlement, such as a statement of entitlement for Income Support or an official letter. Discount leisure cards can give you discounts of between 10 and 50% on activities, services and entertainment. These range from sporting activities at local leisure centres to cinemas, theatres, libraries, museums, hairdressers and beauty salons. Help with caring from friends and family Friends and family can provide support for you and the person you care for, especially when you need a break from caring. However, they are not the same as paid professional care workers, and regular caring can place the same stresses on them as on you. They may also be unable or unwilling to commit to giving you a break when you need it. Make sure anyone who takes over from you has all the information they need to look after the person you care for. This may include what they like to eat and at what time, as well as more complex information about the medicines they need to take. Leave a clear list of contacts. These should include the doctor''s number, those of nearby family members and friends, and your own number in case of emergencies. If you have an emergency plan, go through it with the people who will be providing replacement care. If the person you care for needs specialist medical or nursing help while you''re away, arrange this through their GP. This specialist help can include visits from a district nurse or from a community psychiatric nurse. There is no charge for this healthcare, but each NHS body decides what care it will provide. Help with emergency planning Thinking about what you would do in an emergency should be part of the discussion you have as part of your carer''s assessment. The person who carries out your assessment should be able to help you with planning. Carer''s tip from Scope "It might be a good idea to choose someone from your family to be the person''s guardian in case of death. You should ensure that person is familiar, and keep them up-to-date with needs." To create an emergency plan, you will need to note down details of: the name, address and any other contact details of the person you look after who you and the person you look after would like to be contacted in an emergency – this could be friends, family or professional people involved in the person''s care any medication the person is taking any ongoing treatment they need You can register with a carers emergency scheme in your area. If you do, a skilled worker trained to look at your individual situation may be able to help you make your emergency plans. Who can help make an emergency plan? Every carer who has an assessment should be asked about emergencies and offered help to plan for them. The social worker involved in your carer''s assessment should be able to help you with emergency planning.

You shouldn’t be discharged from hospital until: You are medically fit (this can only be decided by the consultant or someone the consultant has said can make the decision on their behalf). You have had an assessment to look at the support you need to be discharged safely. You have been given a written care plan that sets out the support you’ll get to meet your assessed needs.  The support described in your care plan has been put in place and it’s safe for you to be discharged. Each hospital has its own discharge policy. You should be able to get a copy of this from the ward manager or the hospital’s Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS). A hospital’s discharge policy should state how patients and carers are involving in discharge planning. You can decide whether you want a family carer involved in decisions about your future care. If you have limited capacity to make your own decision, the Mental Capacity Act will apply. It is worth thinking about appointing a deputy or enacting a welfare power of attorney before you go into hospital. Before you go into hospital If you’re due to go into hospital in a planned way, such as for an operation, planning for what happens afterwards should happen before you ever arrive at the hospital. For unplanned admissions, such as if you’ve had a fall and hurt yourself, discharge planning should begin on the day you’re admitted to hospital. You’ll usually be given an estimated date of discharge within 24 to 48 hours of being admitted to hospital. Your progress will be reviewed and, if there’s likely to be a change to your discharge date, you should be kept updated. Read more about what happens after surgery. The person co-ordinating your discharge for should be available each day, and you should be given their name and details of how to contact them. They are sometimes called "discharge co-ordinators" or "ward co-ordinators". Hospital discharge assessment and care plan A discharge assessment looks at the needs you are likely to have when you’re discharged or transferred from hospital. Many people only need a small amount of support when they leave hospital, but others will need a more comprehensive package of care. If you are likely to have ongoing health and social care needs when you leave hospital, the assessment may be carried out by a multidisciplinary team of health or social care professionals. Depending on your needs, the multidisciplinary team could include a social worker, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, mental health nurse or dietitian. You should be fully involved in the assessment process, and your views should be listened to. With your permission, any family carers will also be kept informed and given the opportunity to contribute. If you would like help putting your views across, an independent advocate (for example, from a charity such as Age UK) may be able to help. A care plan will be drawn up, detailing the health and social care support for you, and you should be fully involved. The care plan should include details of: the treatment and support you will get when you’re discharged  who will be responsible for providing support, and how to contact them when, and how often, support will be provided  how the support will be monitored and reviewed  the name of the person who is co-ordinating the care plan  who to contact if there’s an emergency or if things don’t work as they should  information about any charges that will need to be paid (if applicable) What might be in a care plan? The types of support in someone’s care plan will depend on their assessed needs and preferences. A care plan could include: Community care services from the local authority, such as reablement services: An assessment for these must be arranged if it seems that you may need them. NHS continuing healthcare. NHS funded nursing care. Intermediate care: This is short-term care that’s provided free of charge for people who no longer need to be in hospital but may need extra support to help them recover. It lasts for a maximum of six weeks and can be provided in someone’s home or in a residential setting. Other NHS services, such as rehabilitation or palliative care.   Equipment such as wheelchairs, specialist beds, or aids and adaptations for daily living. Support from voluntary agencies: Some organisations such as Age UK and the Red Cross provide "home from hospital" services that can help with household tasks or shopping while you settle back home.  Care and support that’s paid for privately. This may be an option you aren’t eligible for help from the local authority. Carers’ involvement in hospital discharge If someone you know is in hospital and about to be discharged, you should not be put under pressure to accept a caring role or take on more than you’re already doing if you are already their carer. You should be given adequate time to consider whether or not this is what you want or are able to do. If necessary, you should ask for other arrangements to be made while you are reaching a decision. If you decide that you are going to provide care for the person who is being discharged from hospital, you’re entitled to your own carer’s assessment from social services. It is possible that your carer’s assessment will be done over a period of time, beginning before the person you''re looking after is discharged from hospital and continuing once they are home. When you are discharged from hospital On the day of discharge, the person co-ordinating the discharge should make sure that: you (and a carer if you have one) have a copy of the care plan  transport is arranged to get you home any carers will be available if needed  your GP is notified in writing you have any medication or other supplies you’ll need  you’ve been trained how to use any equipment, aids or adaptations needed you have appropriate clothes to wear   you have money and keys for your home If you are being discharged to a care home, the care home should also be told the date and time of your discharge, and have a copy of the care plan. After discharge from hospital Your care should be monitored and reviewed as set out in your care plan. The care plan should also include details of who to contact if things don’t work as planned. If your care plan includes community care services from a local authority, it should check that their care package is working well within two weeks of discharge. If you live alone, this should take place within the first few days of discharge. Following this, your care plan should be reviewed at least annually. Complaints about hospital discharge You might not be happy with the way your discharge from hospital is being handled. For example, if: the hospital plans to discharge you before you think it’s safe there isn’t enough support in your care plan you don’t think your discharge assessment and care planning was carried out correctly If you are in this situation or you have concerns about someone else who is still in hospital, it’s best to raise them straight away so that they can be addressed as soon as possible. Speak to the person who is co-ordinating the discharge, or the supervising consultant. You may find it helpful to get support from the hospital’s Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) or your local Independent Health Complaints Advocacy service. If you want to complain about how a hospital discharge was handled, you could start by speaking to the staff involved to see if the problem can be resolved informally.

Symptoms of ADHD tend to be noticed at an early age and may become more noticeable when a child''s circumstances change, such as when they start school. Most cases are diagnosed when children are 6 to 12 years old. The symptoms of ADHD usually improve with age, but many adults who are diagnosed with the condition at a young age continue to experience problems. People with ADHD may also have additional problems, such as sleep and anxiety disorders. Read more about the symptoms of ADHD. Getting help  Many children go through phases where they''re restless or inattentive. This is often completely normal and doesn''t necessarily mean they have ADHD. However, you should consider raising your concerns with your child''s teacher, their school''s special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) or GP if you think their behaviour may be different to most children their age. It''s also a good idea to speak to your GP if you''re an adult and you think you may have ADHD, but you weren''t diagnosed with the condition as a child. Read more about diagnosing ADHD. What causes ADHD? The exact cause of ADHD is unknown, but the condition has been shown to run in families. Research has also identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared to those who don''t have the condition. Other factors that have been suggested as potentially having a role in ADHD include: being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) having a low birthweight smoking, alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy It''s thought that around 2% to 5% of school-aged children may have ADHD. ADHD can occur in people of any intellectual ability, although it''s more common in people with learning difficulties. Read more about the causes of ADHD. How ADHD is treated Although there''s no cure for ADHD, it can be managed with appropriate educational support, advice and support for parents and affected children, alongside medication, if necessary. Medication is often the first treatment offered to adults with ADHD, although psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may also help. Read more about treating ADHD. Living with ADHD Looking after a child with ADHD can be challenging, but it''s important to remember that they can''t help their behaviour. Some issues that may arise in day-to-day life include: getting your child to sleep at night getting ready for school on time listening to and carrying out instructions being organised social occasions shopping Adults with ADHD may also find they have similar problems, and some may have issues with drugs, crime and employment. Read about living with ADHD for information on ways to cope with these issues. Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 25/04/2016 Next review due: 01/04/2019', 560882612),

They are given to both people with care and support needs, and also to carers. A personal budget or direct payment will be created after an assessment by social services. If the council decides that you need any kind of support, you will receive a personal budget and can choose a direct payment instead of letting them arrange services for you. If you aren’t able to, or don’t want to manage your own finances, it''s possible for another person to manage the direct payments on your behalf. Direct payments Direct payments are voluntary, and you need to request or agree to have one. You can’t be forced to have direct payments. If you decide to have direct payments, you can change your mind about this at any time. If you no longer want direct payments, contact your local social services and ask them to arrange services instead. Click on the links below for more information: Why choose a direct payment? Who can have direct payments? Consenting to direct payments Managing your direct payments Employing people and using agencies Managing direct payments for someone else User controlled trusts or independent living trusts (if someone lacks capacity) Why choose a direct payment? If you need care and support, this had in the past been provided direct from your local council. Direct payments were introduced to give people more choice and control over how their care and support was arranged, to help them live more independently. The direct payment is paid to you by the council so that you can decide how you want to meet your care and support needs. Many people choose to employ their own personal assistant, although there are many other ways direct payments can be used. The full control over care and support that direct payments enables is an attractive option for many people. However, some people may be unsure whether they want or could manage a direct payment. In these cases, the council can provide you with a mixed package of care. A mixed package of care may consist of a smaller direct payment, with some care and support arranged by the council or a provider. This allows people to try out direct payments, before deciding whether to move to a "full" direct payment. Who can have direct payments? In most cases, if you or the person you''re looking after are assessed and social services decide you need support services, they must offer you the option of receiving direct payments to arrange care and support yourself, instead of having it arranged for you. If you want a direct payment, but do not wish to manage it yourself, a “nominated person” can receive the direct payment and manage it on your behalf. If a person lacks capacity to request a direct payment, an “authorised person” can request a direct payment and manage it on their behalf. There are very limited situations when social services don''t have a duty to offer direct payments. This applies to: certain people who are subject to mental health laws; in this case, social services can decide whether or not to offer direct payments offenders who are required to undergo treatment for drug or alcohol dependence If someone is assessed as being eligible for support and it''s not possible for them to get direct payments or they do not want one, social services must provide care and support directly, or through an individual service fund. Consenting to direct payments You have to be able to consent to direct payments to receive them. To give consent, a person doesn''t have to completely understand how direct payments work. It is enough that a person understands that direct payments would give them the opportunity to make choices for themselves. Giving consent is not the same as being able to manage the direct payments alone. If someone is capable of giving consent to have the choice of direct payments, they may still need support to manage the direct payments. Managing direct payments The council should set out your obligations and responsibilities in a direct payment agreement that you may be asked to sign. This could include: keeping records and accounting for how the money is spent to social services taking on the legal role of an employer if you''re using the payment to pay for a care worker; talk to the council about local organisations who can help manage the administration and other responsibilities of being an employer Direct payments can only be spent on things that will meet the assessed needs of the person. If you spend a direct payment on something that doesn''t meet your needs, social services can recover the money from you or terminate the direct payment agreement. Everyone who gets support from social services should have their care and support plan reviewed at least once a year. If someone''s needs have changed, they should contact social services to request a review of their care plan. If needs have changed in a way that affects the details within the current plan, the council may conduct another assessment of needs, or a financial assessment. Social services can charge for care and support. This means that you may need to make a financial contribution towards your personal budget amount. Your local social services must tell you if you''ll need to contribute, and how much, and this will be detailed in your personal budget. Their charges must be in accordance with the law. Usually, the council will subtract any charge you need to pay from the personal budget amount, rather than asking you to pay. You should be able to get help managing direct payments if you need it. Contact your local authority''s social services department to find out what assistance they provide. Social services may give help directly or through a local direct payments support service. Local voluntary organisations may also be able to provide tailored support, and Disability Rights UK has specialist expertise in direct payments. Employing people and using agencies GOV.UK has tips on employing someone if you decide to use your direct payment to hire a person directly. If you get direct payments and recruit a self-employed care worker or contract with an agency, you won’t have the responsibility of being an employer. You can find out whether someone is self-employed or if they count as your employee by using HMRC’s employment status indicator online tool. You may still need advice on, for example, recruitment, taking references, background checks and insurance. In some situations, employing a family member to provide care or administrative support may be an option. However, the council needs to agree it is necessary for you to use direct payments to employ a spouse or partner, or a close relative you live with. For example, during the care planning process, you may explain that only the family member could fulfil the role – for example, for religious or cultural reasons. If you choose instead to use an agency for your care services, they will take on many of the employment responsibilities. When choosing an agency, you''ll need to decide what sort of service you''re looking for and the tasks you need help with. It''s a good idea to contact more than one agency as they may offer different types of services. You can find out about local home care agencies by: asking social services getting in touch with direct payments support services contacting the UK Home Care Association speaking to other people who get direct payments contacting the Care Quality Commission, which regulates all care providers Find out about having care at home. Managing direct payments for someone else If someone doesn''t have the mental capacity to request direct payments, it''s possible for an “authorised person" to request the direct payment and take on responsibility for them. This will usually be a carer, family member or friend. An "authorised person" getting direct payments on behalf of someone else who lacks capacity must: act in the best interests of the person who lacks capacity make sure that the person has as much input as possible into decisions that affect them let social services know as soon as possible if it seems that the person might be regaining the mental capacity to make their own decisions Contact social services if you want to find out about managing direct payments for someone you care for. Find out about assessing whether someone has mental capacity. User-controlled trusts or independent living trusts User-controlled or independent living trusts are a way for people who don''t have the capacity or ability to manage their own direct payments to get support from people close to them. Trusts can be set up to help manage direct payments, but they can also manage other money, including social security benefits. A trust is a legal commitment that creates legal duties and responsibilities for the trustees (the people who have agreed to manage the trust). The trust deed is a written document that contains information about the trust. It has to be signed by the trustees and countersigned by independent witnesses. The trust deed will name all the trustees and the person for whom the trust is being made. It will spell out the purposes of the trust and the powers of the trustees. Trustees could be carers, family members, friends, neighbours or professionals. The law says there must be a minimum of two trustees, but it''s better to have at least three. Above all, it''s important that the trustees are committed to the person for whom the trust is made and have a good knowledge of their needs. You can get advice on setting up a trust from Money Advice Service. HMRC also has advice on setting up a trust. Trustees need to think very carefully about their liability for any loss to the trust. The trust deed should contain an agreement that if, for example, the trust suffers a financial loss, the trustees won''t be personally liable. This protection for a trustee would not apply if the loss were caused by the trustee in a deliberate or fraudulent way.

Telecare in our lives - Tracey and Lynette''s story Media last reviewed: 10/09/2015 Next review due: 10/09/2017 Having a personal alarm fitted can be very useful as they can help you safely remain in your own home. They can help avoid the costly upheaval of moving into sheltered accommodation or a care home. Alarms are worth discussing with your local authority social services department if you are having an assessment of your needs. It may view an alarm as community equipment necessary to meet your assessed care needs, and provide them free of charge after an assessment by an occupational therapist. Alternatively, it should ensure you are left with enough money to pay for any community alarm system after care and support charges have been deducted. If you are going to buy an alarm yourself, you need to consider the many options available to choose from. Some alarms will alert a carer or neighbour. These include: portable alarms – these are battery-powered or use pressurised gas and can be bought from high street shops or online. They are worn or carried and make a high-pitched sound when triggered, which can be heard from a limited distance. fixed position alarms – these have a fixed transmitter and receiver and are operated by a pull cord or similar trigger, which sends a high-pitched sound to alert anyone within a limited distance. Some systems can be designed to release door locks automatically if activated to allow a neighbour to enter the home when the alarm is triggered. portable alarms with a fixed-position receiver – these are worn around the neck or wrist, and the alarm can be triggered by the person wearing them. An alarm is sounded from a receiver mounted on a wall or other fixed position to alert someone within earshot.  portable transmitters and portable receivers – these are worn by carers and the people they are looking after, making it easier for the carer to be aware of when the alarm is triggered. If you''re living with someone else who looks after you, you may want systems that can alert people if you need help when you''re in separate rooms, such as an intercom system. Other typical alarms include: fall alarms – this is a portable device that is activated when the person wearing it falls to a 20 degree angle or more and lies without moving for eight seconds. A signal is sent to a portable pager or an autodial alarm telephone is activated. movement monitors – these are mainly used at night and can alert a carer to epileptic seizures by detecting movement or monitoring vital signs. An alarm is triggered if the sensors notice something is wrong. wandering alarms – most often used to alert a carer when a person strays, this alarm is activated by pressure sensors located in a bedside mat or doorway, or when someone gets out of bed. Some alarms are worn and trigger a warning alarm if the person goes through a door fitted with an antenna. a hypothermia alarm – this is used to monitor room temperature. An alarm is triggered if the temperature falls below a designated level. Gas detectors and smoke or fire detectors are also worth fitting to keep you safe. Telecare at home Telecare systems can help you continue to live independently by allowing someone else – typically a relative who lives elsewhere – to make sure you''re safe. A telecare system is typically made up of a network of sensors that are fitted all around the home. These sensors can be linked through a telephone line to a call centre. Telecare is different from a personal alarm system as you don''t need to do anything to trigger the alarm. It is also different from telehealth systems, which can be used to remotely monitor your health signs, such as blood pressure. Depending on what is needed, the telecare system can also include prompts – for example, giving a reminder to take your medication. Some systems can turn off the electricity or gas mains in the home if they detect danger. If you think you might benefit from a telecare system, contact your local authority''s social services department. Social services can provide telecare system to people who are assessed as needing them and deemed financially eligible for these services. Alternatively, your local NHS trust may pay for a telecare system as part of a continuing healthcare or intermediate care package, if you are eligible. Find out more about NHS Continuing Care. If you can''t get funding from the NHS or your local authority, you may have to pay for a telecare service yourself if you feel you would benefit from it. It''s a good idea to see what telecare systems are available and which are best suited to you and your home. There are telecare demonstrator sites you can visit to see the systems in operation. The Telecare Services Association can help you identify telecare or telehealth services for yourself or your family, friends, or people you provide care for. Which? Elderly Care also has a useful guide to telecare and telehealth systems. Page last reviewed: 15/01/2015 Next review due: 15/01/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

It''s not usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment or within a few weeks without treatment. Impetigo is the most common skin infection in young children in the UK, but it can affect people of all ages. This topic covers: Symptoms When to seek medical advice Causes Treatment Preventing the spread of impetigo Preventing recurrent impetigo Complications Symptoms of impetigo  There are two types of impetigo: non-bullous impetigo – the most common type bullous impetigo The symptoms of both types are described below. Non-bullous impetigo The symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores – usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected. The sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin. After the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually fades without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks. The sores aren''t painful, but they may be itchy. It''s important not to touch or scratch the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of the body, and to other people. Other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and swollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases. Bullous impetigo The symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the central part of the body between the waist and neck, or on the arms and legs. The blisters are usually about 1-2cm across. The blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring. The blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. As with non-bullous impetigo, it''s important not to touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin. Symptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo. When to seek medical advice Speak to your GP if you think you or your child may have symptoms of impetigo. Impetigo isn''t usually serious, but it can sometimes have similar symptoms to more serious conditions such as cellulitis (an infection of the deeper layers of skin) so it''s important to get a correct diagnosis. Your GP can also prescribe treatment to help clear up the infection more quickly than if it was left untreated. Causes of impetigo Impetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacteria can infect the skin in two main ways: through a break in otherwise healthy skin – such as a cut, insect bite or other injury – this is known as primary impetigo through skin damaged by another underlying skin condition, such as head lice, scabies or eczema – this is known as secondary impetigo The bacteria can be spread easily through close contact with someone who has the infection, such as through direct physical contact, or by sharing towels or flannels. As the condition doesn''t cause any symptoms until four to 10 days after initial exposure to the bacteria, it''s often easily spread to others unintentionally. Children and people with diabetes or a weakened immune system – either due to a condition such as HIV or a treatment such as chemotherapy – are most at risk of developing impetigo. Treating impetigo Impetigo usually gets better without treatment in around two to three weeks. However, treatment is often recommended because it can reduce the length of the illness to around seven to 10 days and can lower the risk of the infection being spread to others. The main treatments prescribed are antibiotic creams or antibiotic tablets. These usually have to be used for around a week. Read about treating impetigo. Preventing the spread of impetigo During treatment, it''s important to take precautions to minimise the risk of impetigo spreading to other people or to other areas of the body. Most people are no longer contagious after 48 hours of treatment or once their sores have dried and healed. It''s important to stay away from work, school, nursery or playgroup until this point. The advice below can also help to prevent the spread of the infection: don''t share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo – wash them at a high temperature after use wash the sores with soap and water and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing avoid touching or scratching the sores, or letting others touch them – it may help to ensure your nails are kept clean and short avoid contact with newborn babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym – until the risk of infection has passed wash your hands frequently – particularly after touching infected skin washable toys should also be washed – wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completely If you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they''re seen by a GP as soon as possible. Preventing recurrent impetigo To reduce the risk of impetigo returning, make sure any cuts, scratches or bites are kept clean. Ensure any condition that causes broken skin, such as eczema, is treated promptly. If you develop impetigo frequently, your doctor may suggest taking a swab from around your nose to see if you carry staphylococcal bacteria. These bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, although they can lead to impetigo if they infect broken skin nearby. If you''re found to carry these bacteria, you may be prescribed an antiseptic nasal cream to apply several times a day for five to 10 days in an attempt to clear the bacteria and reduce the chances of impetigo recurring. Complications of impetigo Complications of impetigo are rare, but they can sometimes occur and can be serious. Tell your GP if you have impetigo and your symptoms change or get worse. Some complications associated with impetigo include: cellulitis – an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue scarlet fever – a rare bacterial infection that causes a fine, pink rash across the body guttate psoriasis – a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection septicaemia (a type of sepsis) – a bacterial infection of the blood Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) – a serious skin condition that looks like the skin has been scalded with boiling water post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis – an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneys In very rare cases, impetigo may lead to some scarring, particularly if you scratch at the blisters, crusts or sores.

(18, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/consent-to-treatment/pages/introduction.aspx', 'able to consent', 'Consent to treatment - NHS Choices', 'Consent to treatment  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', '  Consent to treatment is the principle that a person must give permission before they receive any type of medical treatment, test or examination. This must be done on the basis of an explanation by a clinician. Consent from a patient is needed regardless of the procedure – whether it''s a physical examination, organ donation or something else. The principle of consent is an important part of medical ethics and the international human rights law. This topic covers: Defining consent How consent is given Consent from children and young people When consent isn''t needed Consent and life-sustaining treatment Complaints Defining consent For consent to be valid, it must be voluntary and informed, and the person consenting must have the capacity to make the decision. These terms are explained below: Voluntary – the decision to either consent or not to consent to treatment must be made by the person themselves, and must not be influenced by pressure from medical staff, friends or family. Informed – the person must be given all of the information in terms of what the treatment involves, including the benefits and risks, whether there are reasonable alternative treatments and what will happen if treatment doesn''t go ahead. Capacity – the person must be capable of giving consent, which means they understand the information given to them, and they can use it to make an informed decision. If an adult has the capacity to make a voluntary and informed decision to consent to or refuse a particular treatment, their decision must be respected. This is still the case even if refusing treatment would result in their death, or the death of their unborn child. If a person doesn''t have the capacity to make a decision about their treatment, the healthcare professionals treating them can go ahead and give treatment if they believe it''s in the person’s best interests. However, the clinicians must take reasonable steps to seek advice from the patient’s friends or relatives before making these decisions. Read more about assessing the capacity to consent. How consent is given Consent can be given: verbally – for example, by saying they''re happy to have an X-ray in writing – for example, by signing a consent form for surgery Someone could also give non-verbal consent, as long as they understand the treatment or examination about to take place – for example, holding out an arm for a blood test. Consent should be given to the healthcare professional directly responsible for the person''s current treatment, such as: a nurse arranging a blood test a GP prescribing new medication a surgeon planning an operation If someone is going to have a major medical procedure, such as an operation, their consent should ideally be secured well in advance, so they have plenty of time to obtain information about the procedure and ask questions. If they change their mind at any point before the procedure, the person is entitled to withdraw their previous consent. Consent from children and young people If they''re able to, consent is usually given by patients themselves. However, someone with parental responsibility may need to give consent for a child up to the age of 16 to have treatment. Read more about the rules of consent applying to children and young people When consent isn''t needed There are a few exceptions when treatment may be able to go ahead without the person''s consent, even if they''re capable of giving their permission. It may not be necessary to obtain consent if a person: requires emergency treatment to save their life, but they''re incapacitated (for example, they''re unconscious) – the reasons why treatment was necessary should be fully explained once they''ve recovered immediately requires an additional emergency procedure during an operation – there has to be a clear medical reason why it would be unsafe to wait to obtain consent, and it can''t be simply for convenience with a severe mental health condition – such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or dementia – lacks the capacity to consent to the treatment of their mental health (under the Mental Health Act 1983) – in these cases, treatment for unrelated physical conditions still requires consent, which the patient may be able to provide, despite their mental illness requires hospital treatment for a severe mental health condition, but self-harmed or attempted suicide while competent and is refusing treatment (under the Mental Health Act 1983) – the person''s nearest relative or an approved social worker must make an application for the person to be forcibly kept in hospital, and two doctors must assess the person''s condition is a risk to public health (due to rabies, cholera or tuberculosis (TB) is severely ill and living in unhygienic conditions (under the National Assistance Act 1948) – a person who is severely ill or infirm and is living in unsanitary conditions can be taken to a place of care without their consent Consent and life-sustaining treatments A person may be being kept alive with supportive treatments – such as lung ventilation – without having made an advance decision, which outlines the care they would refuse to receive. In these cases, a decision about continuing or stopping treatment needs to be made based on what that person''s best interests are believed to be. To help reach a decision, the healthcare professionals responsible for the person’s care should discuss the issue with the relatives and friends of the person receiving the treatment. They should consider, among other things: what the person''s quality of life will be if treatment is continued how long the person may live if treatment is continued whether there''s any chance of the person recovering Treatment can be withdrawn if there''s an agreement that continuing treatment isn''t in the person''s best interests. The case will be referred to the courts before further action is taken if: an agreement can''t be reached a decision has to be made on whether to withdraw treatment from someone who has been in a state of impaired consciousness for a long time (usually at least 12 months) It''s important to note the difference between withdrawing a person''s life support and taking a deliberate action to make them die. For example, injecting a lethal drug would illegal. Complaints If you believe you''ve received treatment you didn''t consent to, you can make an official complaint. Read more about how to make a complaint.

(19, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/challenging-behaviour-carers.aspx', 'Dealing with challenging behaviour', 'Caring and challenging behaviour - Care and support - NHS Choices', '', 'A person''s behaviour can be defined as "challenging" if it puts them or those around them (such as their carer) at risk, or leads to a poorer quality of life. It can also impact on their ability to join in everyday activities. Challenging behaviour can include aggression, self-harm, destructiveness and disruptiveness. Communication is the main way we interact and express our needs, likes and dislikes. If communication is a problem, it can be very frustrating for the person and may result in challenging behaviour. If this behaviour leads to a desired outcome, it may be repeated again and again. Challenging behaviour is often seen in people with conditions that affect communication and the brain, such as learning disabilities or dementia. What can you do to help? As a carer, try to understand why the person you look after is behaving in this way. For example, they might feel anxious or bored, or in pain. If you can recognise the early warning signs, you may be able to prevent behavioural outbursts. For example, if being in a large group of people makes the person you care for feel anxious and they become agitated, you could arrange for them to be in a smaller group or have one-to-one support. Some people find a distraction can focus a person''s energies elsewhere and prevent them displaying challenging behaviour. The person you care for might behave in a challenging way to get your attention. If this is the case, consider not responding directly to their behaviour – although you shouldn''t ignore them completely. But if their behaviour puts them or someone else at risk, you''ll need to intervene as calmly as possible. Professional help with challenging behaviour If you''re finding it hard to cope with the behaviour of the person you look after, you can ask your GP to refer you to a specialist with knowledge of challenging behaviour. You will usually be asked to keep a record of the person''s behaviour to see if there are any patterns. The specialist will want to know what situations or people trigger the behaviour, what the early warning signs are, and what happens after the event. A specialist will try to find out what the person is aiming for in their challenging behaviour. Do they crave one-to-one attention, or do they want to be removed from a situation they find difficult? If a reason for the behaviour can be established, their needs could be met in an alternative way to prevent them resorting to challenging behaviour. Any techniques you try must be followed consistently by all those involved in the care of the person you look after. If everyone does this, it will help the individual involved to understand what''s expected of them. In extreme circumstances – for example, if the person''s behaviour is harmful to themselves or others and all methods of calming them have been tried – a doctor may prescribe medication. If you''re concerned about the side effects of medication, speak to the person''s GP. Challenging behaviour – help for carers If you care for someone who displays challenging behaviour and you find it difficult to cope, support is available. It is particularly important that you seek support if you are experiencing harm from the person you care for (whether intentional or unintentional). Many organisations for people with learning disabilities or dementia have strategies for coping with challenging behaviour. Some of these organisations also provide opportunities for carers to connect with other people in a similar situation – for example, through family linking schemes. Sharing your experiences – for example, with a local carers'' group – can be a good way of getting support. Contact the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053 or through your carers support group. Respite care for the person you look after enables you to take a break from your caring responsibilities. It''s one of the services your local authority can provide after an assessment for the person you care for, or a carer''s assessment for you. See our pages on Carers'' assessments for more information. Friends and family members can also be an important source of practical and emotional support. Sometimes you may consider "restraining" the person if you believe their behaviour is putting themselves at risk and they don''t have the mental ability or capacity to make a decision. But you should not restrain the person unless it is a reasonable action to take. Find out about Lasting Power of Attorney and restraint. Read about tackling challenging behaviour in children. Carer''s tip from Scope "When faced with someone who is aggressive and shouting, keep your face neutral and lower the volume and pitch of your own voice. Nine times out of ten, they will quieten down to hear what you are saying." Sexually inappropriate behaviour in children Sexual exploration and play is a natural part of childhood sexual development, and helps children to develop physically and emotionally. Throughout their development, every child will express themselves sexually in different ways. A child''s behaviour will depend on their age and circumstances. The NSPCC website describes the behaviours typical of each developmental stage. It is normal to see a child exhibiting behaviour that is slightly more or less mature for their age. Read more about talking to your children about sex and relationships. If you have concerns about a child''s behaviour There are many reasons why children may show sexual behaviour that is inappropriate or unexpected for their age. It could be related to curiosity, anxiety, a traumatic experience, or because of a learning disability or mental health problem. If your child acts inappropriately in public, try to distract them with another activity. This can be a useful way to defuse the situation. If you think your child''s behaviour is related to an illness, speak to the healthcare professionals involved in your child''s care and ask for advice on how to manage their behaviour. They may inform you of local or national organisations that could help. If you are concerned about the safety or welfare of a child, you can contact the NSPCC 24-hour helpline on 0808 800 5000 or email the NSPCC. Sexually inappropriate behaviour in adults who need care Sexually inappropriate behaviour in adults who need care can be a result of a mental health or neurological condition, such as dementia. It may include undressing in public, fondling genitals, or touching someone inappropriately. For more information on sex and disabilities, call the Outsiders website helpline. You may not be able to stop a person engaging in inappropriate sexual behaviour, but there are ways you can address the issue. Think about or ask the person why they are acting in a certain way. For example, if they start to undress in public, are they hot or uncomfortable? React calmly to their behaviour.  Treat the situation with humour, rather than sounding angry.  Distract their attention, rather than being confrontational. If other people are present, you could explain to them that the behaviour is because of an illness and is not directed at them personally. Keep a diary to see if you can find a pattern in their behaviour – for example, whether it is more likely to occur in certain situations, with the same people present, or at certain times of the day or night. If you''re finding it difficult to control the behaviour of the person you look after, speak to social services or their GP.

They are given to both people with care and support needs, and also to carers. A personal budget or direct payment will be created after an assessment by social services. If the council decides that you need any kind of support, you will receive a personal budget and can choose a direct payment instead of letting them arrange services for you. If you aren’t able to, or don’t want to manage your own finances, it''s possible for another person to manage the direct payments on your behalf. Direct payments Direct payments are voluntary, and you need to request or agree to have one. You can’t be forced to have direct payments. If you decide to have direct payments, you can change your mind about this at any time. If you no longer want direct payments, contact your local social services and ask them to arrange services instead. Click on the links below for more information: Why choose a direct payment? Who can have direct payments? Consenting to direct payments Managing your direct payments Employing people and using agencies Managing direct payments for someone else User controlled trusts or independent living trusts (if someone lacks capacity) Why choose a direct payment? If you need care and support, this had in the past been provided direct from your local council. Direct payments were introduced to give people more choice and control over how their care and support was arranged, to help them live more independently. The direct payment is paid to you by the council so that you can decide how you want to meet your care and support needs. Many people choose to employ their own personal assistant, although there are many other ways direct payments can be used. The full control over care and support that direct payments enables is an attractive option for many people. However, some people may be unsure whether they want or could manage a direct payment. In these cases, the council can provide you with a mixed package of care. A mixed package of care may consist of a smaller direct payment, with some care and support arranged by the council or a provider. This allows people to try out direct payments, before deciding whether to move to a "full" direct payment. Who can have direct payments? In most cases, if you or the person you''re looking after are assessed and social services decide you need support services, they must offer you the option of receiving direct payments to arrange care and support yourself, instead of having it arranged for you. If you want a direct payment, but do not wish to manage it yourself, a “nominated person” can receive the direct payment and manage it on your behalf. If a person lacks capacity to request a direct payment, an “authorised person” can request a direct payment and manage it on their behalf. There are very limited situations when social services don''t have a duty to offer direct payments. This applies to: certain people who are subject to mental health laws; in this case, social services can decide whether or not to offer direct payments offenders who are required to undergo treatment for drug or alcohol dependence If someone is assessed as being eligible for support and it''s not possible for them to get direct payments or they do not want one, social services must provide care and support directly, or through an individual service fund. Consenting to direct payments You have to be able to consent to direct payments to receive them. To give consent, a person doesn''t have to completely understand how direct payments work. It is enough that a person understands that direct payments would give them the opportunity to make choices for themselves. Giving consent is not the same as being able to manage the direct payments alone. If someone is capable of giving consent to have the choice of direct payments, they may still need support to manage the direct payments. Managing direct payments The council should set out your obligations and responsibilities in a direct payment agreement that you may be asked to sign. This could include: keeping records and accounting for how the money is spent to social services taking on the legal role of an employer if you''re using the payment to pay for a care worker; talk to the council about local organisations who can help manage the administration and other responsibilities of being an employer Direct payments can only be spent on things that will meet the assessed needs of the person. If you spend a direct payment on something that doesn''t meet your needs, social services can recover the money from you or terminate the direct payment agreement. Everyone who gets support from social services should have their care and support plan reviewed at least once a year. If someone''s needs have changed, they should contact social services to request a review of their care plan. If needs have changed in a way that affects the details within the current plan, the council may conduct another assessment of needs, or a financial assessment. Social services can charge for care and support. This means that you may need to make a financial contribution towards your personal budget amount. Your local social services must tell you if you''ll need to contribute, and how much, and this will be detailed in your personal budget. Their charges must be in accordance with the law. Usually, the council will subtract any charge you need to pay from the personal budget amount, rather than asking you to pay. You should be able to get help managing direct payments if you need it. Contact your local authority''s social services department to find out what assistance they provide. Social services may give help directly or through a local direct payments support service. Local voluntary organisations may also be able to provide tailored support, and Disability Rights UK has specialist expertise in direct payments. Employing people and using agencies GOV.UK has tips on employing someone if you decide to use your direct payment to hire a person directly. If you get direct payments and recruit a self-employed care worker or contract with an agency, you won’t have the responsibility of being an employer. You can find out whether someone is self-employed or if they count as your employee by using HMRC’s employment status indicator online tool. You may still need advice on, for example, recruitment, taking references, background checks and insurance. In some situations, employing a family member to provide care or administrative support may be an option. However, the council needs to agree it is necessary for you to use direct payments to employ a spouse or partner, or a close relative you live with. For example, during the care planning process, you may explain that only the family member could fulfil the role – for example, for religious or cultural reasons. If you choose instead to use an agency for your care services, they will take on many of the employment responsibilities. When choosing an agency, you''ll need to decide what sort of service you''re looking for and the tasks you need help with. It''s a good idea to contact more than one agency as they may offer different types of services. You can find out about local home care agencies by: asking social services getting in touch with direct payments support services contacting the UK Home Care Association speaking to other people who get direct payments contacting the Care Quality Commission, which regulates all care providers Find out about having care at home. Managing direct payments for someone else If someone doesn''t have the mental capacity to request direct payments, it''s possible for an “authorised person" to request the direct payment and take on responsibility for them. This will usually be a carer, family member or friend. An "authorised person" getting direct payments on behalf of someone else who lacks capacity must: act in the best interests of the person who lacks capacity make sure that the person has as much input as possible into decisions that affect them let social services know as soon as possible if it seems that the person might be regaining the mental capacity to make their own decisions Contact social services if you want to find out about managing direct payments for someone you care for. Find out about assessing whether someone has mental capacity. User-controlled trusts or independent living trusts User-controlled or independent living trusts are a way for people who don''t have the capacity or ability to manage their own direct payments to get support from people close to them. Trusts can be set up to help manage direct payments, but they can also manage other money, including social security benefits. A trust is a legal commitment that creates legal duties and responsibilities for the trustees (the people who have agreed to manage the trust). The trust deed is a written document that contains information about the trust. It has to be signed by the trustees and countersigned by independent witnesses. The trust deed will name all the trustees and the person for whom the trust is being made. It will spell out the purposes of the trust and the powers of the trustees. Trustees could be carers, family members, friends, neighbours or professionals. The law says there must be a minimum of two trustees, but it''s better to have at least three. Above all, it''s important that the trustees are committed to the person for whom the trust is made and have a good knowledge of their needs. You can get advice on setting up a trust from Money Advice Service. HMRC also has advice on setting up a trust. Trustees need to think very carefully about their liability for any loss to the trust. The trust deed should contain an agreement that if, for example, the trust suffers a financial loss, the trustees won''t be personally liable. This protection for a trustee would not apply if the loss were caused by the trustee in a deliberate or fraudulent way.

(21, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/measles/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Measles', 'Measles - NHS Choices', 'Measles  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes lead to serious complications. It''s now uncommon in the UK because of the effectiveness of vaccination. Anyone can get measles if they haven''t been vaccinated or they haven''t had it before, although it''s most common in young children. The infection usually clears in around 7 to 10 days. Symptoms of measles The initial symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you''re infected. These can include: cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40C (104F) small greyish-white spots on the inside of the cheeks A few days later, a red-brown blotchy rash will appear. This usually starts on the head or upper neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body. Read more about the symptoms of measles. When to see your GP You should contact your GP as soon as possible if you suspect that you or your child may have measles. It''s best to phone before your visit as your GP surgery may need to make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others. You should also see your GP if you''ve been in close contact with someone who has measles and you''ve not been fully vaccinated (had two doses of the MMR vaccine) or haven''t had the infection before – even if you don''t have any symptoms. Is measles serious? Measles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems. Once you''ve had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus and it''s highly unlikely you''ll get it again. However, measles can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (encephalitis). Read more about the complications of measles. How measles is spread The measles virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can easily catch measles by breathing in these droplets or, if the droplets have settled on a surface, by touching the surface and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth. The virus can survive on surfaces for a few hours. People with measles are infectious from when the symptoms develop until about four days after the rash first appears. How measles can be prevented Measles can be prevented by having the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. This is given in two doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. The first dose is given when your child is around 13 months old and a second dose is given before your child starts school. Adults and older children can be vaccinated at any age if they haven''t been fully vaccinated before. Ask your GP about having the vaccination. If the MMR vaccine isn''t suitable for you, a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) can be used if you''re at immediate risk of catching measles. Read more about preventing measles. Treating measles There are several things you can do to help relieve your symptoms and reduce the risk of spreading the infection, including: taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve fever, aches and pains – aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old drinking plenty of water to avoid dehydration closing the curtains to help reduce light sensitivity using damp cotton wool to clean the eyes staying off school or work for at least four days from when the rash first appears In severe cases, especially if there are complications, you or your child may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. Read more about treating measles. How common is measles? The effectiveness of the MMR vaccine means that cases of measles are uncommon in the UK nowadays. However, the number of cases has risen in recent years and there have been some high-profile outbreaks. For example, between November 2012 and July 2013 there was an outbreak in and around Swansea, during which more than 1,200 cases were reported. It''s thought the rise in the number of cases of measles is the result of parents not getting their child vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, probably because of speculation linking MMR to autism. Publicity in 1998 highlighted a report claiming there was a link between the MMR jab and autism. However, numerous studies undertaken to investigate this claim found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Page last reviewed: 11/09/2015 Next review due: 01/09/2018', 1401306472),

If someone''s needs have changed, they should contact social services to request a review of their care plan. If needs have changed in a way that affects the details within the current plan, the council may conduct another assessment of needs, or a financial assessment. Social services can charge for care and support. This means that you may need to make a financial contribution towards your personal budget amount. Your local social services must tell you if you''ll need to contribute, and how much, and this will be detailed in your personal budget. Their charges must be in accordance with the law. Usually, the council will subtract any charge you need to pay from the personal budget amount, rather than asking you to pay. You should be able to get help managing direct payments if you need it. Contact your local authority''s social services department to find out what assistance they provide. Social services may give help directly or through a local direct payments support service. Local voluntary organisations may also be able to provide tailored support, and Disability Rights UK has specialist expertise in direct payments. Employing people and using agencies GOV.UK has tips on employing someone if you decide to use your direct payment to hire a person directly. If you get direct payments and recruit a self-employed care worker or contract with an agency, you won’t have the responsibility of being an employer. You can find out whether someone is self-employed or if they count as your employee by using HMRC’s employment status indicator online tool. You may still need advice on, for example, recruitment, taking references, background checks and insurance. In some situations, employing a family member to provide care or administrative support may be an option. However, the council needs to agree it is necessary for you to use direct payments to employ a spouse or partner, or a close relative you live with. For example, during the care planning process, you may explain that only the family member could fulfil the role – for example, for religious or cultural reasons. If you choose instead to use an agency for your care services, they will take on many of the employment responsibilities. When choosing an agency, you''ll need to decide what sort of service you''re looking for and the tasks you need help with. It''s a good idea to contact more than one agency as they may offer different types of services. You can find out about local home care agencies by: asking social services getting in touch with direct payments support services contacting the UK Home Care Association speaking to other people who get direct payments contacting the Care Quality Commission, which regulates all care providers Find out about having care at home. Managing direct payments for someone else If someone doesn''t have the mental capacity to request direct payments, it''s possible for an “authorised person" to request the direct payment and take on responsibility for them. This will usually be a carer, family member or friend. An "authorised person" getting direct payments on behalf of someone else who lacks capacity must: act in the best interests of the person who lacks capacity make sure that the person has as much input as possible into decisions that affect them let social services know as soon as possible if it seems that the person might be regaining the mental capacity to make their own decisions Contact social services if you want to find out about managing direct payments for someone you care for. Find out about assessing whether someone has mental capacity. User-controlled trusts or independent living trusts User-controlled or independent living trusts are a way for people who don''t have the capacity or ability to manage their own direct payments to get support from people close to them. Trusts can be set up to help manage direct payments, but they can also manage other money, including social security benefits. A trust is a legal commitment that creates legal duties and responsibilities for the trustees (the people who have agreed to manage the trust). The trust deed is a written document that contains information about the trust. It has to be signed by the trustees and countersigned by independent witnesses. The trust deed will name all the trustees and the person for whom the trust is being made. It will spell out the purposes of the trust and the powers of the trustees. Trustees could be carers, family members, friends, neighbours or professionals. The law says there must be a minimum of two trustees, but it''s better to have at least three. Above all, it''s important that the trustees are committed to the person for whom the trust is made and have a good knowledge of their needs. You can get advice on setting up a trust from Money Advice Service. HMRC also has advice on setting up a trust. Trustees need to think very carefully about their liability for any loss to the trust. The trust deed should contain an agreement that if, for example, the trust suffers a financial loss, the trustees won''t be personally liable. This protection for a trustee would not apply if the loss were caused by the trustee in a deliberate or fraudulent way.

Usually, you can''t get more than one of these benefits at the same time. This means that even if you''re entitled to more than one earnings-replacement benefit, you''ll usually receive whichever is the highest. This is called the overlapping benefits rule. Earnings-replacement benefits The following earnings-replacement benefits are based on National Insurance (NI) contributions.  Bereavement Allowance (formerly Widow''s Pension) Contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance Contribution-based Jobseeker''s Allowance Maternity Allowance State Pension Widowed Parent''s Allowance Carer''s Allowance is not based on NI contributions. You usually can''t receive more than one of the above benefits at the same time. If you or the person you care for are entitled to more than one of these benefits, a benefit based on NI contributions will be paid in preference to Carer''s Allowance or any other earnings-replacement benefit that does not depend on NI contributions. If you''re entitled to two benefits, you''ll get the benefit that pays the higher amount. If you''re entitled to a benefit based on NI contributions, but this is worth less than another benefit not based on NI contributions, you''ll be paid the benefit based on NI contributions plus the difference between the two benefits. Increases for adult dependants Some earnings-replacement benefits may give you an increased amount if you have an adult dependant. You''ll only receive one increase for an adult dependant, even if you get more than one earnings-replacement benefit. You''ll receive the highest increase that can be paid. Overlapping benefits If you cannot be paid any Carer''s Allowance because you''re being paid another earnings-replacement benefit, you still have an underlying entitlement to Carer''s Allowance. Although you won''t be paid Carer''s Allowance, it''s worth making a claim for it. This is because the underlying entitlement to Carer''s Allowance means an amount called a carer premium, or carer addition for Pension Credit, can be included in the calculation of any means-tested benefits you''re entitled to. The carer premium or addition can make it more likely you''ll receive a means-tested benefit, or more of a means-tested benefit is paid to you. For example, Carol is 64 and looks after her husband. She gets a State Pension and Pension Credit. She makes a claim for Carer''s Allowance, but is told she cannot be paid it because it overlaps with the State Pension she receives. The letter she receives from the Carer''s Allowance Unit will tell her that although Carer''s Allowance cannot be paid, she has an underlying entitlement to it. Carol can then send a copy of this letter to the Pension Service (who pay her Pension Credit), and they will increase the amount of Pension Credit she receives. This is because a carer''s addition will be added to her Pension Credit. A carer addition can be paid as part of Pension Credit. A carer premium can be paid as part of the following means-tested benefits: Income Support Income-related Employment and Support Allowance Jobseeker''s Allowance Housing Benefit Find out more about benefits for carers.

They are given to both people with care and support needs, and also to carers. A personal budget or direct payment will be created after an assessment by social services. If the council decides that you need any kind of support, you will receive a personal budget and can choose a direct payment instead of letting them arrange services for you. If you aren’t able to, or don’t want to manage your own finances, it''s possible for another person to manage the direct payments on your behalf. Direct payments Direct payments are voluntary, and you need to request or agree to have one. You can’t be forced to have direct payments. If you decide to have direct payments, you can change your mind about this at any time. If you no longer want direct payments, contact your local social services and ask them to arrange services instead. Click on the links below for more information: Why choose a direct payment? Who can have direct payments? Consenting to direct payments Managing your direct payments Employing people and using agencies Managing direct payments for someone else User controlled trusts or independent living trusts (if someone lacks capacity) Why choose a direct payment? If you need care and support, this had in the past been provided direct from your local council. Direct payments were introduced to give people more choice and control over how their care and support was arranged, to help them live more independently. The direct payment is paid to you by the council so that you can decide how you want to meet your care and support needs. Many people choose to employ their own personal assistant, although there are many other ways direct payments can be used. The full control over care and support that direct payments enables is an attractive option for many people. However, some people may be unsure whether they want or could manage a direct payment. In these cases, the council can provide you with a mixed package of care. A mixed package of care may consist of a smaller direct payment, with some care and support arranged by the council or a provider. This allows people to try out direct payments, before deciding whether to move to a "full" direct payment. Who can have direct payments? In most cases, if you or the person you''re looking after are assessed and social services decide you need support services, they must offer you the option of receiving direct payments to arrange care and support yourself, instead of having it arranged for you. If you want a direct payment, but do not wish to manage it yourself, a “nominated person” can receive the direct payment and manage it on your behalf. If a person lacks capacity to request a direct payment, an “authorised person” can request a direct payment and manage it on their behalf. There are very limited situations when social services don''t have a duty to offer direct payments. This applies to: certain people who are subject to mental health laws; in this case, social services can decide whether or not to offer direct payments offenders who are required to undergo treatment for drug or alcohol dependence If someone is assessed as being eligible for support and it''s not possible for them to get direct payments or they do not want one, social services must provide care and support directly, or through an individual service fund. Consenting to direct payments You have to be able to consent to direct payments to receive them. To give consent, a person doesn''t have to completely understand how direct payments work. It is enough that a person understands that direct payments would give them the opportunity to make choices for themselves. Giving consent is not the same as being able to manage the direct payments alone. If someone is capable of giving consent to have the choice of direct payments, they may still need support to manage the direct payments. Managing direct payments The council should set out your obligations and responsibilities in a direct payment agreement that you may be asked to sign. This could include: keeping records and accounting for how the money is spent to social services taking on the legal role of an employer if you''re using the payment to pay for a care worker; talk to the council about local organisations who can help manage the administration and other responsibilities of being an employer Direct payments can only be spent on things that will meet the assessed needs of the person.

As you get older, you may find that memory loss becomes a problem. It''s normal for your memory to be affected by age, stress, tiredness, or certain illnesses and medications. This can be annoying if it happens occasionally, but if it''s affecting your daily life or is worrying you or someone you know, you should seek help from your GP. How common is dementia? According to the Alzheimer''s Society there are around 800,000 people in the UK with dementia. One in three people over 65 will develop dementia, and two-thirds of people with dementia are women. The number of people with dementia is increasing because people are living longer. It is estimated that by 2021, the number of people with dementia in the UK will have increased to around 1 million. What is dementia? Dementia is a common condition. Your risk of developing dementia increases as you get older, and the condition usually occurs in people over the age of 65. Dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) associated with an ongoing decline of the brain and its abilities. This includes problems with: memory loss thinking speed mental agility language understanding judgement People with dementia can become apathetic or uninterested in their usual activities, and have problems controlling their emotions. They may also find social situations challenging, lose interest in socialising, and aspects of their personality may change. A person with dementia may lose empathy (understanding and compassion), they may see or hear things that other people do not (hallucinations), or they may make false claims or statements.  As dementia affects a person''s mental abilities, they may find planning and organising difficult. Maintaining their independence may also become a problem. A person with dementia will therefore usually need help from friends or relatives, including help with decision making. Your GP will discuss the possible causes of memory loss with you, including dementia. Other symptoms can include: increasing difficulties with tasks and activities that require concentration and planning depression changes in personality and mood periods of mental confusion difficulty finding the right words Most types of dementia can''t be cured, but if it is detected early there are ways you can slow it down and maintain mental function. Read more about the symptoms of dementia. Why is it important to get a diagnosis? An early diagnosis can help people with dementia get the right treatment and support, and help those close to them to prepare and plan for the future. With treatment and support, many people are able to lead active, fulfilled lives.

Most people have to pay something towards their own care and some will have to pay for all of the costs. Your local authority (council) may cover some or all of the cost of care in some circumstances, but its help is "means-tested". This means that who pays depends on what your needs are, how much money you have, and what level and type of care and support you require. For most people needing social care services, the first place to start is by asking your local authority for an assessment of your social care (care and support) needs. If the local authority considers that you need support that it can provide, it may also carry out an assessment of your finances. This assessment will determine whether the local authority will meet all the cost of your care, or whether you will need to contribute towards your care cost or whether you will have to meet the full costs yourself. Find out about support paid for by your local authority. Currently, local authorities won’t provide care services if you have more than £23,250 in savings and property (your "capital"). However, from April 2020, this threshold will rise alongside the introduction of the cap on care costs, so more people will be eligible for help sooner. Alternatives to care funded by the local authority  NHS care The NHS is responsible for funding certain types of healthcare equipment you may need. In some situations, the NHS is also responsible for meeting care needs. This is usually when your need is mainly for healthcare rather than social care NHS care could be provided in hospital, but it could be in someone’s own home or elsewhere in the community. NHS continuing healthcare If the person you care for has very severe and complex health needs, they may qualify for NHS continuing healthcare. This is an ongoing package of care that’s fully funded by the NHS. In some areas of the country, you can arrange your NHS Continuing Healthcare using a personal health budget – similar to the personal budgets for social care outlined above. Find out about personal health budgets. NHS-funded nursing care You should receive NHS-funded nursing care if: you live in a care home registered to provide nursing care, and you don’t qualify for NHS continuing healthcare but have been assessed as needing care from a registered nurse The NHS will make a payment directly to the care home to fund care from registered nurses who are usually employed by the care home. For more information see What is NHS-funded nursing care? NHS aftercare People who were previously detained in hospital under certain sections of the Mental Health Act will have their aftercare services provided for free. Help from charities and funds There are other sources of funding you might be able to access to help you with funding care. Some charities can help with funding care needs. For example, the Family Fund is a government-backed charity that can help with grants if you care for a severely disabled child aged 17 or under. You can get an application pack from the Family Fund website. Get personal advice on care funding The cost of care and support is likely to be a long-term commitment and may be substantial, particularly if you choose to go into a care home, or if you have care needs at an early age. If you or a member of the family need to pay for care at home or in a care home, it’s important to understand the alternatives. This makes advice tailored to your individual needs vital. You can get advice from: your local authority – through an assessment of your care and support needs, as well as advice on which services are available locally financial advice from a qualified, independent source – there are independent financial advisers who specialise in care funding advice; they are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and must stick to a code of conduct and ethics, and take shared responsibility for the suitability of any product they recommend Page last reviewed: 29/07/2015 Next review due: 29/07/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

It’s most recognisable by the painful swellings at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), giving a person with mumps a distinctive "hamster face" appearance. Other symptoms of mumps include headaches, joint pain and a high temperature, which may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands. When to see your GP It''s important to contact your GP if you suspect mumps so a diagnosis can be made. While mumps isn''t usually serious, the condition has similar symptoms to more serious types of infection, such as glandular fever and tonsillitis. Your GP can usually make a diagnosis after seeing and feeling the swelling, looking at the position of the tonsils in the mouth and checking the person''s temperature to see if it''s higher than normal. Let your GP know in advance if you''re coming to the surgery, so they can take any necessary precautions to prevent the spread of infection. If your GP suspects mumps, they should notify your local health protection unit (HPU). The HPU will arrange for a sample of saliva to be tested to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. How mumps is spread Mumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu – through infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and transferred into the mouth or nose.   A person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards. During this time, it''s important to prevent the infection spreading to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who haven''t been vaccinated. If you have mumps, you can help prevent it spreading by: regularly washing your hands with soap using and disposing of tissues when you sneeze avoiding school or work for at least five days after your symptoms first develop Preventing mumps You can protect your child against mumps by making sure they''re given the combined MMR vaccine (for mumps, measles and rubella). The MMR vaccine is part of the routine NHS childhood immunisation schedule. Your child should be given one dose when they are around 12-13 months and a second booster dose before they start school. Once both doses are given, the vaccine provides 95% protection against mumps. Treatment for mumps There''s currently no cure for mumps, but the infection should pass within one or two weeks. Treatment is used to relieve symptoms and includes: getting plenty of bed rest and fluids using painkillers, such as ibuprofen and paracetamol – aspirin shouldn''t be given to children under 16 applying a warm or cool compress to the swollen glands to help relieve pain Read more about treating mumps. Complications Mumps usually passes without causing serious damage to a person''s health. Serious complications are rare. However, mumps can lead to viral meningitis if the virus moves into the outer layer of the brain. Other complications include swelling of the testicles in males or the ovaries in females (if the affected male or female has gone through puberty). Read more about the complications of mumps. Who is affected Most cases of mumps occur in young adults (usually born between 1980 and 1990) who didn’t receive the MMR vaccine as part of their childhood vaccination schedule or didn''t have mumps as a child. There were 2,224 confirmed cases of mumps in England and Wales during 2014. Once you''ve been infected by the mumps virus, you normally develop a life-long immunity to further infection. Page last reviewed: 07/08/2015 Next review due: 01/08/2018', -1715133216),

Find out more about the causes of back pain. In most cases back pain will improve in a few weeks or months, although some people experience long-term pain or pain that keeps coming back. Types of back pain Backache is most common in the lower back (lumbago), although it can be felt anywhere along your spine, from your neck down to your hips. Read information on neck pain and shoulder pain, which are covered separately. Sometimes back pain can be caused by an injury or disease, such as: a slipped disc – when one of the discs in the spine is damaged and presses on the nerves sciatica – irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve, which causes pain, numbness and tingling that travels down one leg whiplash – neck injury caused by a sudden impact frozen shoulder – inflammation around the shoulder that causes pain and stiffness ankylosing spondylitis – a long-term condition that causes pain and stiffness where the spine meets the pelvis The rest of this information will focus on back pain that doesn''t have an obvious cause. Doctors call this non-specific back pain. What to do Most cases of back pain get better on their own and you may not need to see a doctor. If you''ve only had back pain for a few days or weeks, the following advice may help relieve your symptoms and speed up your recovery: remain as active as possible and try to continue with your daily activities take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen if you feel you need to use hot or cold compression packs – you can buy these from your local pharmacy, or a bag of frozen vegetables and a hot water bottle will work just as well Although it can be difficult to be cheerful or optimistic if you are in pain, it''s important to stay positive as this can help you recover faster. Read more about treatments for short-term back pain. Treatments for long-term back pain If you''re worried about your back or your pain hasn''t improved by around six weeks, it''s a good idea to visit your GP, who can advise you about the treatments available. These include: stronger painkillers exercise classes – where you are taught specific exercises to strengthen your muscles and improve your posture manual therapy – such as physiotherapy, chiropractic or osteopathy acupuncture counselling – such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) support and advice at a specialist pain clinic Some people choose to see a therapist for manual therapy or acupuncture without seeing their GP first.

An advocacy service is provided by an advocate who is independent of social services and the NHS, and who isn''t part of your family or one of your friends. An advocate''s role includes arguing your case when you need them to, and making sure the correct procedures are followed by your health and social care services. Being independent means they are there to represent your wishes without giving their personal opinion and without representing the views of the NHS or the local authority. An advocate might help you access information you need or go with you to meetings or interviews in a supportive role. You may want your advocate to write letters on your behalf, or speak for you in situations where you don''t feel able to speak for yourself. Local authorities fund advocacy services in their area. To find an advocacy service, contact your local council or check its website. If you have a care co-ordinator from your local social services or healthcare team, they will liaise with other agencies for you. Advocacy and disability organisations People with learning or physical disabilities can often struggle to be listened to and have their wishes understood. SEAP is an organisation that provides advocacy support, and wants everyone to "have their voice heard on issues that are important to them within health and social care services". It also provides training for advocates, volunteers and professionals who need to understand the role of advocacy in health and social care services. The British Institute of Learning Disabilities (BILD) works with people with learning disabilities and their families to make sure they have the right support to make choices and decisions about their own lives. Mencap''s advocacy service enables people with a learning disability to speak up and make decisions about things that are important to them, while their Empower Me service provides personalised advocacy support for people with a learning disability. It aims to help people develop the skills, confidence and knowledge needed to voice concerns and secure rights. Other advocacy organisations Some advocacy services help people with a specific condition. For example, Diabetes UK offers an advocacy service for vulnerable people with diabetes, and is available in many areas of England and Wales. Email the Diabetes UK advocacy service or visit the Diabetes UK website. Age UK gives advice and information to older people and their carers, family, friends and other people involved in their care. Some branches offer advocacy services. Carers UK has a free advice line for carers – call 0808 808 7777 or visit the Carers UK website for advice on many aspects of caring. It doesn''t provide an advocacy service, but can give you information on where to go for help. Advocates from the charity VoiceAbility can help you get your voice heard and involved in making key decisions about your care and health needs. Voiceability specialises in working with vulnerable people, such as those who have a disability, communication difficulties, mental health needs, and those who lack capacity, or those who have no one else to support them. Advocacy and mental capacity The Mental Capacity Act 2005 introduced Independent Mental Capacity Advocates (IMCAs). An IMCA supports people who can''t make or understand decisions by stating their views and wishes or securing their rights. This is a statutory advocacy service, which means in certain situations people who lack capacity must be referred to an advocate. An IMCA is not the decision-maker (such as the person''s doctor or care manager), but the decision-maker has a duty to take into account the information given by the IMCA. The Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA) service aims to help particularly vulnerable people who otherwise have no family or friends consult about those decisions. IMCAs are independent people who work with and support people who lack capacity, and represent their views to those who are working out their best interests. An IMCA must be instructed, and then consulted, for people who lack capacity and have nobody else to support them (other than paid staff) whenever: an NHS body is proposing serious medical treatment an NHS body or local authority is proposing to arrange accommodation (or a change of accommodation) in hospital or a care home and (a) the person will stay in hospital longer than 28 days or (b) they will stay in the care home for more than eight weeks An IMCA may be instructed to support someone who lacks capacity to make decisions concerning: care reviews, when nobody else is available to be consulted adult protection cases, whether or not family, friends or others are involved GOV.UK has more information on what it means to have an IMCA. Independent advocates under the Care Act The IMCA service is not the only form of independent advocacy available to support individuals. New advocacy provision is being introduced as part of the Care Act 2014. The Care Act introduces new statutory advocacy from April 2015. This is for people who have substantial difficulty in being involved with the assessment of their needs, or with their care planning or care reviews, if they have nobody appropriate to help them be engaged. Your local authority can provide more information. Advocacy and mental health The Mental Health Act introduced statutory advocacy for people who are detained under the Mental Health Act or who are under a Community Treatment Order (CTO). This form of advocacy is provided by advocates called Independent Mental Health Advocates (IMHAs).

The Care Act and what it means for me Media last reviewed: 30/09/2015 Next review due: 30/09/2017 A carer is someone who helps another person, usually a relative or friend, in their day-to-day life. This is not the same as someone who provides care professionally or through a voluntary organisation. The Care Act 2014 sets out carers'' legal rights to assessment and support. It came into force in April 2015. The Care Act relates mostly to adult carers – people aged 18 and over who are caring for another adult. This is because young carers (aged under 18) and adults who care for disabled children can be assessed and supported under children''s law. However, regulations under the Act allow the government to make rules about looking at family circumstances when assessing an adult''s need for care, which means, for example, making sure the position of a young carer within a family is not overlooked. The Act also contains new rules about working with young carers or adult carers of disabled children to plan an effective and timely move to adult care and support. What does the Care Act do? Previously, carers didn''t have a legal right to receive support, although local authorities could provide support at their discretion. This meant that the ability to have an assessment and access a range of support varied depending on where you lived. The Care Act gives local authorities a responsibility to assess a carer''s need for support, where the carer appears to have such needs. This replaced the law which said the carer must be providing "a substantial amount of care on a regular basis" to qualify for an assessment. This means more carers are now able to have an assessment. The local authority will assess whether the carer has needs and what those needs may be. This assessment will consider the impact of caring on the carer. It will also consider the things a carer wants to achieve in their own day-to-day life. It must also consider other important issues, such as whether the carer is able or willing to carry on caring, whether they work or want to work, and whether they want to study or do more socially. If both the carer and the person they care for agree, a combined assessment of both their needs can be undertaken. I''m a carer. Am I eligible for support? When the carer''s assessment is complete, the local authority must decide whether the carer''s needs are eligible for support from the local authority. This approach is similar to that used for adults with care and support needs. In the case of carers, eligibility depends on the carer''s situation. The carer will be entitled to support if: they are assessed as having needs that meet the eligibility criteria  the person they care for lives in the local authority area (which means their established home is in that local authority area) If there is a charge (as there sometimes may be, as explained below), it has to be accepted by the carer (or the adult being cared for, if it falls to them). Support planning for carers The local authority and the carer will agree a support plan, which sets out how the carer''s needs will be met. This could include, for example, help with housework or buying a laptop to keep in touch with family and friends. It may be that the best way to meet a carer''s needs is to provide care and support directly to the person they care for – for example, by providing replacement care to allow someone to take a break from caring. It''s possible to do this as long as the person needing care agrees. Charging and financial assessment for carers In most cases, local authorities don''t charge for providing support to carers, in recognition of the valuable contribution carers make to their local community. But this is something the local authority can decide. If the local authority does decide to charge a carer for providing them with support, it must carry out a financial assessment to decide whether the carer can afford to pay. If supporting a carer involves providing care to the person being cared for and the local authority chooses to charge for that type of care, the authority must carry out a financial assessment of the person who is being cared for. This is because the care would be provided directly to that adult, and not to the carer. The Act makes it clear that in such cases, the carer cannot be charged. Personal budgets for carers Carers should receive a personal budget, which is a statement showing the cost of meeting their needs, as part of their support plan. It will include the amount the carer will pay, if any, and the amount the local authority is going to pay. Carers have the right to request that the local authority meets some or all of such needs by giving them a direct payment, which will give them control over how their support is provided. The Care Act and young carers The Care Act does not deal with the assessment of people under the age of 18 who care for others. However, young carers can be supported under the law relating to children. The Children and Families Act gives young carers (and parent carers) similar rights to assessment as other carers have under the Care Act. Regulations under the Care Act set out how assessments of adults must be carried out to ensure the needs of the whole family are considered. This could include assessing what an adult needs to enable them to fulfil their parental responsibilities towards their children, or to ensure that young people do not undertake inappropriate caring responsibilities. Find out more about who can help young carers. Adults caring for disabled children An adult caring for a disabled child can get support through children''s services. This is usually the best way to meet their needs, as they are not covered by this Act. However, there is provision in the Act for an adult carer of a disabled child to ask for an assessment of their caring needs before the child reaches 18. When a local authority carries out such an assessment, it has the power to provide support to the carer, even though they are caring for a child, rather than an adult. This would, for example, enable a local authority to provide the support available through an adult carers'' centre. Young carers: transitioning to adult services The Act says adult social services need to be involved in planning the support a young carer may need once they reach 18. This also applies to adult carers of children where it appears likely that the adult carer will have needs for support after the child turns 18.

Constant Attendance Allowance can only be paid if you also receive either Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit at the 100% level or an 80% War Disablement Pension. A medical examination will be carried out to determine the extent of the disability. You also need to show that you need daily care and attention as a result of your disability, and that you''re likely to need that care for a long time. The daily help that unpaid carers provide is counted for these purposes. The type of care and attention needed must be directly connected to your disability or illness. Needing help with dressing, undressing or ordinary housework is not sufficient. How much is Constant Attendance Allowance? There are different weekly rates of Constant Attendance Allowance, which depend on the extent of the disability of the person you''re looking after and the amount of care that they need. You will get either the normal rate, the intermediate rate, or an exceptional rate if you''re severely disabled and need attendance all the time. There''s also a "part-time" rate for those who only need part-time attendance. How to claim Constant Attendance Allowance If you are paid Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit at the 100% rate, you may be awarded Constant Attendance Allowance based on a medical opinion without having to make a separate claim. Otherwise, contact Barnsley Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Centre for more information, on 0345 758 5433. If you are paid War Disablement Pension, you can claim Constant Attendance Allowance on Form WPA 0003, which can be obtained from Veterans UK by telephone, on 0808 1914 218. Will other claims for benefits be affected? If you are eligible for Constant Attendance Allowance, you will not be eligible to get Attendance Allowance or the care component of Disability Living Allowance as well. However, if those benefits would amount to more than Constant Attendance Allowance, your Constant Attendance Allowance can be topped-up to bring it to the same level. Constant Attendance Allowance may affect means-tested benefits paid, such as Income Support and Pension Credit. The official online source of government information on benefits is GOV.UK.

Some people may also have other symptoms, depending on the cause. It affects most people from time to time and is usually nothing to worry about. However, it can be distressing and unpleasant until it passes, which normally takes a few days to a week. The excessive loss of water in your poo can also sometimes lead to symptoms of dehydration, which can be serious if it''s not recognised and treated quickly. This topic covers: When to seek medical advice Causes Treatment Prevention When to seek medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if you''re concerned about yourself or your child. You should also contact your GP in the situations outlined below, as they may mean an increased risk of a more serious problem. Read more about diagnosing the cause of diarrhoea. Babies You should contact your GP or health visitor urgently if your baby has had six or more episodes of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours, or if they''ve vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours. You should also seek advice if your baby has any symptoms of dehydration. Children Contact your GP if your child has:  had six or more episodes of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours diarrhoea and vomiting at the same time watery poo blood in their poo a severe or continuous stomach ache symptoms of dehydration You should also contact your GP if your child has persistent diarrhoea. Most cases will pass in five to seven days. Adults Contact your GP if you have diarrhoea and: there''s blood in your poo you''re vomiting persistently you''ve lost a lot of weight you''ve passed a large amount of very watery diarrhoea it occurs at night and is disturbing your sleep you''ve recently taken antibiotics or been treated in hospital you have symptoms of dehydration your poo is dark or black – this may be a sign of bleeding inside your stomach You should also contact your GP if you have persistent diarrhoea. Most cases in adults will pass in two to four days. Causes of diarrhoea There are many different causes of diarrhoea, but a bowel infection (gastroenteritis) is a common cause in both adults and children. Gastroenteritis can be caused by: a virus – such as norovirus or rotavirus bacteria – such as campylobacter or Escherichia coli (E. coli), which are often picked up from contaminated food  a parasite – such as the parasite that causes giardiasis, which is spread in contaminated water These infections can sometimes be caught during travel abroad, particularly to areas with poor standards of public hygiene. This is known as travellers'' diarrhoea. Diarrhoea can also be the result of: anxiety a food allergy medication a long-term condition, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Read more about the causes of diarrhoea. Treating diarrhoea Most cases of diarrhoea clear up after a few days without treatment, and you may not need to see your GP. However, diarrhoea can lead to dehydration, so you should drink plenty of fluids – frequent small sips of water – until it passes. It''s very important that babies and small children don''t become dehydrated. Your pharmacist may suggest you use an oral rehydration solution (ORS) if you or your child are particularly at risk of dehydration. You should eat solid food as soon as you feel able to. If you''re breastfeeding or bottle feeding your baby and they have diarrhoea, you should try to feed them as normal. Stay at home until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea to prevent spreading any infection to others. Medications to reduce diarrhoea, such as loperamide, are available. However, these aren''t usually necessary, and most types shouldn''t be given to children. Read more about treating diarrhoea. Preventing diarrhoea Diarrhoea is often caused by an infection. You can reduce your risk by making sure you maintain high standards of hygiene. For example, you should: wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after going to the toilet and before eating or preparing food  clean the toilet, including the handle and the seat, with disinfectant after each bout of diarrhoea  avoid sharing towels, flannels, cutlery or utensils with others wash soiled clothing and bed linen separately from other clothes and at the highest temperature possible – for example, 60C or higher for linen – after first removing any poo into the toilet  avoid returning to work or school until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea Read more about preventing germs spreading. Traveller''s diarrhoea It''s important to practise good food and water hygiene while travelling abroad, such as avoiding potentially unsafe tap water and undercooked food. If you''re planning a trip abroad, check health advice for the countries you''ll be travelling to. You can do this by visiting the NHS Fit for Travel and National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) websites.

The vaccine is given as a liquid from a dropper straight into the baby’s mouth for them to swallow. Rotavirus is a highly infectious stomach bug that typically strikes babies and young children, causing an unpleasant bout of diarrhoea, sometimes with vomiting, tummy ache and fever. Most children recover at home within a few days, but nearly one in five will need to see their doctor, and one in 10 of these end up in hospital as a result of complications such as extreme dehydration. A very small number of children die from rotavirus infection each year. Since its introduction into the vaccination programme, the rotavirus vaccine has prevented more than 70% of cases. The brand name of the rotavirus vaccine used in the UK is Rotarix. Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for Rotarix. Which babies can have the rotavirus vaccination? Rotavirus vaccination is available routinely on the NHS as part of the childhood vaccination programme for babies aged 8 weeks and 12 weeks. Read more about which babies can have the rotavirus vaccination. How does the rotavirus vaccine work? Some of the rotavirus is in the vaccine and this helps your baby to build up immunity, so that the next time they come into contact with rotavirus they will not get the disease. The rotavirus in the vaccine is weakened, so your baby won’t get rotavirus disease just from having the vaccination. How effective is the rotavirus vaccine? The rotavirus vaccine is very effective and gives good immunity to rotavirus infection. Since the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in 2013, cases are down by 69%. The vaccine is given routinely to children in the US and many other countries around the world in Europe, Asia and Latin America. How safe is the rotavirus vaccine? There is lots of evidence showing that rotavirus vaccine is safe. Rotarix has been extensively used in many countries, including Belgium, Finland, Austria and Canada for four to five years, and no safety concerns have been raised. What are the side effects of the rotavirus vaccine? The vast majority of babies won’t have any problems at all after having their rotavirus vaccination, although some babies who have the vaccine may become restless and irritable, and some may develop mild diarrhoea. It is possible for a baby to get rotavirus infection after being vaccinated – but it''s usually milder than it would have been if they hadn’t been vaccinated. They can also get a positive rotavirus test after being vaccinated, but this does not usually last for very long – your doctor will not be able to tell whether the positive test is due to the vaccine or the natural infection.

You can buy your own equipment, but a social worker or occupational therapist can help make decisions about the equipment that would be most helpful. Decisions about the kind of equipment you may need will often be the result of an assessment of your care and support needs. If you have a child with a disability, their GP may refer them to a physiotherapist to assess their mobility needs. The physiotherapist assessing them will be able to explain what kinds of aids may help your child. You may also be entitled to a Disabled Facilities Grant if you need to adapt your home to make changes for a disabled child. This grant can help pay for adaptations such as building safe play areas, installing a stairlift, widening doors or adapting heating or light controls. Equipment that can help you to live more independently can include things like: two-handled cups, tap turners and kettle tippers for the kitchen grab rails and raised toilet seats in the bathroom bed raisers and hoists in the bedroom Free equipment from your local authority If a local authority needs assessment has concluded that you need this equipment, it should be provided free of charge. Minor adaptations costing £1,000 or less – which includes the cost of buying and fitting the adaptation – are also provided free of charge. Councils can make a charge for minor adaptations that cost more than £1,000 to provide. Larger, more expensive items may be classed as adaptations and will be the responsibility of the housing department and provided through Disabled Facilities Grants. If your child needs equipment to help them get full education, it may be provided by the school or the education department of your local authority. Many schools should be able to increase accessibility for individuals by making simple changes to help your child. These changes can include: providing wheelchair ramps and lifts providing railings and improved lighting for visually impaired children providing information in Braille or large print Equipment that can help you at work If you need equipment for work, the Access to Work scheme may be able to pay for the equipment. Contact the disability employment adviser at your local Jobcentre Plus for advice and assistance. Advice on disability, mobility and care equipment and adaptations Before you are provided with equipment, or you buy it, it’s worth getting independent advice to make sure that the type of equipment you’re getting is going to best meet your needs. You can get independent consumer research reports from Rica, an organisation which carries out consumer research for older and disabled people. Help is also available from the Disabled Living Foundation (DLF), a national charity that provides free, impartial advice about all types of home adaptation and mobility products for disabled adults and children, older people, their carers and families. Read more about wheelchairs and mobility equipment. The charity Independence at Home provides grants for disabled people and those with a long-term illness. Grants can be made for adaptations, equipment or other things to help manage at home if they''re not funded by local or national government. Tips on buying equipment Whether you’re buying equipment or having it provided for you, it’s always worth testing out the equipment for yourself first if possible. When installing equipment, you should also consider the following: Is your condition likely to deteriorate? If so, how much use will you get out of the equipment? Who will be operating the equipment – you, a carer, or both?  Does the equipment come with a guarantee and technical support? The Money Advice Service has further advice about shopping around for disability aids and equipment. Equipment and wheelchair loans The NHS can provide equipment, such as walking sticks, walking frames and wheelchairs to aid mobility. These are provided on long-term loans and you can arrange this through your GP, hospital consultant or physiotherapist. There is no charge for this equipment, but there may be a returnable deposit.

Should your toddler have an MMR jab if they have severe eczema? Is it true that babies shouldn''t go swimming before they''ve had their jabs? There are many myths and misunderstandings about whether it''s safe to have a vaccine. Here are the facts. Vaccination facts 1. Don''t have a vaccination when you''re ill It''s a FACT that you should postpone your child''s jab if they are ill and have a fever (high temperature). You may also want to postpone vaccination if your child has had a bad reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine. This doesn''t mean that they will never be able to have the vaccine again, but it''s a good idea to speak to your GP, practice nurse or health visitor first. 2. Don''t have a vaccination if you have an allergy It''s a FACT that your child shouldn''t have a vaccine if they''ve had a confirmed anaphylactic reaction (a severe allergic reaction) to a previous dose of the vaccine or an ingredient in it. 3. Don''t have a "live" vaccine if you have a weakened immune system Live vaccines are ones that contain the virus or bacteria they''re supposed to protect against, albeit in a weakened form. It''s a FACT that your child shouldn''t have live vaccines, such as BCG (tuberculosis vaccination) or MMR, if: your child is taking high-dose steroid tablets, or is taking lower doses either alongside other drugs or over a long time. If you''re not sure, check with a GP your child is being treated for cancer with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or has had these treatments within the last six months your child has had an organ transplant and is on immunosuppressant drugs your child has had a bone marrow transplant and finished all immunosuppressive therapy within the last 12 months your child''s immune system is lowered. If you''re not sure, check with a GP Read more about live vaccines. Vaccination myths 1. It is a MYTH that you have to avoid or delay your child''s vaccination if they have a mild illness without a fever, such as a cough or cold, or if they have an allergy, such as asthma, hay fever or eczema. 2. It is a MYTH that you have to avoid or delay your baby''s vaccinations if they were premature. Read this NHS leaflet on vaccinations for premature babies (PDF, 221kb). 3. It is a MYTH that you have to avoid your baby''s vaccinations if they have a history of febrile seizures or convulsions (related to fever) or epilepsy, or there''s a family history of such conditions. 4. It''s a MYTH that vaccinations can overload a baby''s immune system. In fact, only a tiny fraction of your baby''s immune system is used by childhood vaccines, and they come into contact with many more bugs in their daily life. This video explains why vaccines don''t weaken your child''s immune system. 5. It''s a MYTH that homeopathy can be used as an alternative to vaccinations to protect children against potentially serious infections. In fact, there''s no evidence that homeopathy can protect children against disease and illness. 6. It''s a MYTH that it is unsafe to take your baby swimming around the time of a vaccination. In fact, you can take your baby swimming at any time before and after their vaccinations. Now, read about why it''s a good idea to have your child vaccinated.  Page last reviewed: 07/04/2016 Next review due: 07/04/2018 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

What to do when you first become a carer Media last reviewed: 30/09/2015 Next review due: 30/09/2017 If you provide care and support to an adult friend or family member, you may be eligible for support from your local council. This support could include being offered money to pay for things that make caring easier. Or the local authority might offer practical support, such as arranging for someone to step in when you need a short break. It could also put you in touch with local support groups so you have people to talk to. The Care Act 2014 makes carer''s assessments more widely available to people in caring roles. For more information, read about the Care Act changes for carers. Local authorities now have a legal duty to assess any carer who requests one or who appears to need support. If you are a carer and you need some support, get in touch with the council covering the area where the person you care for lives. The council will be able to give you information and advice about how the assessment will work. A carer’s assessment is a discussion between you and a trained person either from the council or another organisation that the council works. The assessment will consider the impact the care and support you provide is having on your own wellbeing, as well as important aspects of the rest of your life, including the things you want to achieve day-to-day. It must also consider other important issues, such as whether you are able or willing to carry on caring, whether you work or want to work, and whether you want to study or do more socially. The assessment could be done face-to-face, over the telephone or online. The council will use the assessment to identify your support needs, and to discuss how these could be met. This might mean that the council will give you help or put you in touch with other organisations, such as local charities, that you can talk to. Assessments of carers'' needs are carried out slightly differently in some circumstances. Read about: assessments for parents of disabled children (parent carers) assessments for carers of someone who is being discharged from hospital help if you look after someone who receives NHS continuing care Eligibility for care and support services A carer’s assessment looks at the different ways caring affects your life, and works out how you can carry on doing the things that are important to you and your family. It covers your caring role, your feelings about caring, your physical, mental and emotional health, and how caring affects your work, leisure, education, wider family and relationships. Your physical, mental and emotional wellbeing should be at the heart of this assessment. This means that you can tell the council how caring for someone is affecting your life and what you want to be able to do in your day-to-day life. When the assessment is complete, the local authority will decide whether your needs are "eligible" for support from the local authority. After the assessment, your council will write to you about their decision and give you reasons to explain what they have decided. If you have eligible needs, your council will contact you to discuss what help might be available. This will be based on the information you gave them during your assessment. If you do not have needs that are eligible, your council will give you information and advice, including what local care and support is available. This could include, for example, help from local voluntary organisations. Before your carer’s assessment If you have arranged to have a carer''s assessment of your needs, give yourself plenty of time to think about your role as a carer and note your thoughts down. You might consider: whether you want to continue being a carer if you were prepared to continue, what changes would make your life easier  if there is any risk that you will not be able to continue as a carer without support  whether you have any physical or mental health problems, including stress or depression, which make your role as a carer more difficult  whether being a carer affects your relationships with other people, including family and friends  if you are in paid work, whether being a carer causes problems at your work (such as often being late)  if you like more time to yourself so that you can have a rest or enjoy some leisure activity  if you like to do some training, voluntary work or paid work Your decision to be a carer When your carer’s assessment is done, no assumptions should be made about your willingness to be a carer. This can be a very sensitive area, because many of us feel that we have a duty to those we care for. We sometimes rule out other options because we feel we have no choice. You have the right to choose: whether to be a carer at all  how much care you are willing to provide the type of care you are willing to provide There may be some parts of the role that you find more difficult than others. Take a step back and think about your role as a carer. This can be useful in the discussion you have during a carer''s assessment. You may wish to ask in advance for the assessment to happen in private, so that you can speak freely. It is vital that it considers whether the role of a carer is affecting your health or safety. Carers sometimes take on physical tasks, such as lifting and carrying, which can cause long-term health problems. Others can find that the stress of the role can lead to depression or other mental health problems. In some cases, safety can be an issue; for instance, because of the behaviour of the person they look after. During your assessment, explain any mental or physical health problems you are experiencing. Social services will consider all aspects of your health and safety, including caring tasks that might put your health or wellbeing at risk. Some of the things you might need help with include: support to ensure you’re able to attend any medical appointments support if you need to go into hospital for an operation (including recovery after surgery) that you might have been putting off because of your caring commitment. training for you, such as safely lifting A carer''s assessment should also look at your own interests and commitments to see if and how they are disrupted by your role as a carer. If they are disrupted, a social worker could discuss with you whether some support could improve matters for you. The assessment should look at: parenting and childcare marriage or other such relationships friendships and community role paid employment or voluntary work interests, sport, leisure and hobbies time for yourself One of the most important parts of your carer''s assessment will be a discussion about your wishes concerning paid work, training or leisure activities. The local authority must consider the support you may need if you want to stay in your paid job or return to paid work. They must also consider the support you may need if you want to continue or start studying or training. During and after a carer’s assessment If you are looking after someone, the local authority will consider a broad range of issues that can affect your ability to provide care as part of their assessment of your needs. When assessing your needs, social services must consider whether your role as a carer is sustainable. The assessment is about your needs and therefore you should: have a reasonably detailed discussion about all the matters relevant to you have the assessment in private if you want to, at a convenient time and place for you get relevant information, including about welfare benefits you could claim and details of other services  have a chance to identify the outcomes that you want; any services should be appropriate for you and meet your needs  be given flexibility and innovation in identifying services that may meet your needs  have an opportunity to give feedback about the assessment  be told about any charges before services are arranged Support planning for carers After your assessment, you and the local authority will agree a support plan, which sets out how your needs will be met. This might include help with housework, buying a laptop to keep in touch with family and friends, or becoming a member of a gym so you can look after their own health. It may be that the best way to meet a carer’s needs is to provide care and support directly to the person that they care for, for example, by providing replacement care to allow the carer to take a break. It is possible to do this as long as the person needing care agrees. Your support plan should consider whether your situation is likely to change, but you may want to contact social services and ask them to reassess you if this happens. More information View the Practical guide to healthy caring (PDF, 4.33Mb) produced by NHS England and others for tips on how to stay healthy whilst caring for others. The guide focuses on older carers as well as people new to caring. Also find out what happens after a carer’s assessment and how care and support is paid for. Other kinds of assessments of carers Parent carer assessments If you are a parent of a disabled child aged under 18, your child can be assessed by the local authority under law relating to the needs of children in the Children and Families Act 2014. You will also be assessed as part of that process because social services will look at the needs of the family as a whole. This is often referred to as a "holistic" assessment. The assessment should take into account detailed information about your family, including: the family’s background and culture  your own views and preferences  the needs of any other children you have The assessment is not a test of your parenting skills, but should be a sensitive look at any difficulties the family has as a whole, with a view to considering what support or services are needed. A care plan should be drawn up that would include services to benefit both you and your disabled child. For example, there could be adaptations to the home, help with bathing or regular respite breaks to ensure you get the rest you need. You could also choose to have a direct payment so that you can buy in your own services for your child. Carer''s assessments and hospital discharge You might have a carer''s assessment or a review of your support plan if the person you care for has been in hospital and is being discharged. Find out about the hospital discharge process. Carer''s assessments and NHS continuing care As well as care and support organised by the council, some people are also eligible to receive help from the NHS. This help may be a nursing service for people who are ill or recovering at home after leaving hospital. It could include things like changing the dressings on wounds or giving medication. If you are eligible for this kind of help, a health professional such as your GP or community nurse should be able to tell you. In exceptional circumstances, where an adult has a complex medical condition and substantial ongoing care needs, the NHS provides a service called NHS continuing healthcare. NHS continuing healthcare provides care and support in a person’s home, care home or hospice. If you look after someone who qualifies, you may want to find out more about NHS continuing care.

It is also known as infectious mononucleosis, or "mono". Common symptoms include: a high temperature (fever) a severely sore throat swollen glands in the neck fatigue (extreme tiredness) While the symptoms of glandular fever can be very unpleasant, most of them should pass within two to three weeks. Fatigue, however, can occasionally last several months. Read more about the symptoms of glandular fever. When to seek medical advice You should contact your GP if you suspect that you or your child has glandular fever. While there is little your GP can do in terms of treatment, they can provide advice and support to help you control your symptoms and reduce the risk of passing the infection on to others. You should go to your local accident and emergency (A&E) department or dial 999 for an ambulance if you have glandular fever and you: develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties find swallowing fluids difficult develop intense abdominal pain These symptoms can be a sign of a complication of glandular fever that may need to be treated in hospital. What causes glandular fever? Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is found in the saliva of infected people and can be spread through: kissing – glandular fever is often referred to as the "kissing disease" exposure to coughs and sneezes sharing eating and drinking utensils, such as cups, glasses and unwashed cutlery EBV may be found in the saliva of someone who has had glandular fever for several months after their symptoms pass, and some people may continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years. If you have EBV, it''s a good idea to take steps to avoid infecting others while you are ill, such as not kissing other people, but there''s no need no need to avoid all contact with others as the chances of passing on the infection are generally low. Read more about the causes of glandular fever. Who is affected? Glandular fever can affect people of all ages, but most cases affect teenagers and young adults. Most EBV infections are thought to occur during childhood and cause only mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all. However, if a person develops an EBV infection during early adulthood, they can develop glandular fever. Once you have had glandular fever, it is unlikely you will develop it again. This is because people develop lifelong immunity after the initial infection. How glandular fever is diagnosed To diagnose glandular fever, your GP will first ask about your symptoms before carrying out a physical examination. They will look for characteristic signs of glandular fever, such as swollen glands, tonsils, liver and spleen. Your GP may also recommend a blood test to help confirm the diagnosis and rule out infections that can cause similar symptoms, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella, mumps and toxoplasmosis. How glandular fever is treated There is no cure for glandular fever, but there are a number of simple treatments and measures that can help reduce the symptoms while you wait for your body to control the infection. These include: drinking plenty of fluids taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen getting plenty of rest and gradually increasing your activity as your energy levels improve Occasionally, antibiotics or corticosteroids may be used if you develop complications of glandular fever. Some people with particularly severe symptoms may need to be looked after in hospital for a few days. Read more about treating glandular fever. Possible complications Complications associated with glandular fever are uncommon, but when they do occur they can be serious. They can include: further infections of other areas of the body, including the brain, liver and lungs severe anaemia (a lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells) breathing difficulties as a result of the tonsils becoming significantly swollen a ruptured (burst) spleen, which may need to be treated with surgery Read more about the complications of glandular fever.

It was an automatic step for her to have these, which I didn''t question or worry about. "But when she reached her first birthday and it was time for her to have the MMR jab, I had qualms. So did many of my friends with babies the same age. "By this time, all the scare stories (which surfaced in the late 1990s) that the MMR jab could cause autism had been firmly dismissed, and the logical side of me knew that the vaccine was safe and beneficial. But as a mum, I still had nagging doubts." MMR or separate injections? "I know my worries weren''t based on medical facts, but I was very cautious about going ahead. The decision for Harriet to have the MMR jab ultimately lay on my shoulders and I felt under pressure to make the right choice. "A friend had looked into having each of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines as separate single injections, but she told me it was expensive, meant travelling to a private clinic in London and would be six injections, rather than just two, for the MMR course. That, and the fact I knew there was no evidence showing that single injections were any safer than the combined MMR jab, ruled them out as an option." Finding out the facts on MMR "I did some research of my own into the pros and cons of vaccination and, from what I read, all the evidence showed that the MMR jab was safe and had no links with autism. "I talked to a colleague who was a doctor and another friend, who''s a nurse. They were both reassuring and said the benefits far outweighed any potential side effects of the MMR jab. "What really made up my mind to take Harriet for her MMR was that I didn''t want to risk her catching mumps or measles. I knew both of these illnesses can kill a child. "Once I''d made the decision to go ahead, I never looked back. I probably kept a closer eye on Harriet than usual for a day or two after the jab, but she was absolutely fine and I forgot about it. "With the recent surge in cases of measles, I''m so relieved Harriet had the MMR jab and is protected. I''ll definitely be taking her for her pre-school booster."

What to do when you first become a carer Media last reviewed: 30/09/2015 Next review due: 30/09/2017 Carer''s Allowance is the main state benefit for carers, so it''s important to find out if you can receive it. It is currently £61.35 a week, with a one-off £10 Christmas bonus in December. You might be able to get Carer''s Allowance if all of the following apply: you''re 16 or over you spend at least 35 hours a week caring for someone you have been in England, Scotland or Wales for at least two of the last three years you normally live in England, Scotland or Wales, or you live abroad as a member of the armed forces you''re not in full-time education or studying for more than 21 hours a week you earn less than £110 a week (after taxes, care costs while you''re at work and 50% of what you pay into your pension) Unlike other benefits, your savings or National Insurance contributions record won''t make a difference to your claim for Carer''s Allowance. In fact, getting Carer''s Allowance can help you build up your National Insurance contribution record, which will make getting a State Pension easier in the future. Carer''s Allowance is taxable. You can claim Carer''s Allowance online now. Alternatively, read on or click on the links below for more information about this benefit: Age rules for Carer''s Allowance Qualifying benefits for Carer''s Allowance Caring for 35 hours a week Caring and earnings How Carer''s Allowance can help you get other benefits Full-time students Age rules for Carer''s Allowance You can claim Carer''s Allowance if you''re aged 16 or over. There is no upper age limit, but it''s not normally possible to get Carer''s Allowance and State Pension at the same time. When you reach State Pension age, you have the option of putting off taking your pension. This is known as deferring your pension. Deferring State Pension has advantages for some people, as it means they will get a higher pension or lump sum payment at a later date. However, if you defer State Pension and claim Carer''s Allowance, you won''t build up any extra payment or lump sum. This means there is no advantage to deferring your State Pension if you''re getting Carer''s Allowance. You can find out more about deferring State Pension on the GOV.UK website. Getting Carer''s Allowance since October 2002 If you were 65 or over and receiving Carer''s Allowance in October 2002, you can continue to get it even if you stop caring for someone or you start to earn more than the earnings limit. Caring for 35 hours a week To qualify for Carer''s Allowance, you have to provide 35 hours of care each week to the person you look after. What this means: You will need to be providing at least 35 hours of care for the same person.  If you''re caring for two or more disabled people, you can''t add together the hours you''re caring for all of them to make up the 35. Even if you look after more than one person for 35 hours a week, you can only claim one lot of Carer''s Allowance.  When working out whether you provide 35 hours of care in any one week, note that a week runs from Sunday to Saturday under the Carer''s Allowance rules.  You can''t average the time over a number of weeks. You have to provide at least 35 hours of care in each week for which you claim Carer''s Allowance. Care can be at any time It doesn''t matter what time of the day or night the care is provided. If someone you care for comes to stay with you, you can count their visit and the following as part of the 35 hours: the time you take to collect them and take them back to where they live  time spent preparing for their visit – for example, preparing where they will sleep or preparing their meals  time spent cleaning up after they leave  Qualifying benefits for Carer''s Allowance Your eligibility for Carer''s Allowance depends on the benefits the person you''re looking after receives. The person you''re looking after must receive one of the following benefits because they need help with personal care. They are: Personal Independence Payment daily living component Disability Living Allowance (DLA) at either the middle or high rate of the care component any level of Attendance Allowance (AA)  Constant Attendance Allowance of the normal maximum rate, which is paid with a War Disablement Pension or Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Armed Forces Independence Payment If the person you''re looking after only receives the mobility component or lowest rate care component of DLA, you will not be eligible for Carer''s Allowance. If they''re getting the lowest rate care component of DLA and their condition has got worse, you can ask the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to consider its decision again and see if the middle or higher rate of the care component of DLA can be paid instead. When asking for existing benefits to be reconsidered, there is a risk the DWP may decide the person you care for is no longer entitled to the level of benefit they''re already receiving. Claiming PIP, DLA or AA before you claim Carer''s Allowance Before claiming Carer''s Allowance, wait until the person you look after receives a decision about their claim for PIP, AA or DLA. If you make your claim for Carer''s Allowance within three months of the date of that decision, your Carer''s Allowance will be paid from the same date the PIP, DLA or AA is paid. You will be paid the arrears of benefits you''re owed. Claiming top-up (means-tested) benefits while waiting for a decision If you''re entitled to a means-tested benefit such as Income Support, make a claim for it straight away. Do not wait for the person in your care to get a decision on their PIP, DLA or AA claim. You can claim Income Support for up to six months while waiting for the person you''re looking after to get a decision on their PIP, DLA or AA claim. In some cases, you may be entitled to a means-tested benefit only once the person in your care gets PIP, DLA or AA and you have made a claim for Carer''s Allowance. In this situation, you can claim the means-tested benefit at the same time the person you''re looking after claims PIP, DLA or AA. Your claim will be turned down, but if you make another claim for Carer''s Allowance and the means-tested benefit within three months of the PIP, DLA or AA decision date, your means-tested benefit can be paid from the same date that PIP, DLA or AA is paid. Caring and earnings If you''re working and earn less than £110 a week from paid work, you will not lose any of your Carer''s Allowance. If you earn more than £110 a week, you will lose all of your Carer''s Allowance for the weeks you earn that amount. Only earnings affect your entitlement to Carer''s Allowance. It is not affected by other income, such as an occupational pension or maintenance payments. The £110 is a net figure, which is the amount you''re left with after deductions for: National Insurance  Income Tax  half of any pension contributions you make  Common questions about caring and earnings My earnings vary – can I keep my Carer''s Allowance? If your earnings vary, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will usually agree to look at your average earnings over a five-week period if this means the earnings are assessed more accurately. It may help if you show the DWP a copy of your employment contract to show the details of the agreement about how you are to be paid. I am self-employed – what information will the DWP need? If you''re self-employed, your weekly earnings will be averaged over a year. If you have recently become self-employed or there has been a change that''s likely to affect the normal pattern of your business, the DWP can calculate your earnings in a different way. The DWP will decide what period of time would be appropriate to assess your earnings. If you do not think the DWP has been fair in the way it has looked at your earnings, you could ask it to look at the decision again or appeal against it. You will need to supply an up-to-date set of accounts when first claiming. Expenses (such as a car or telephone) incurred for the purposes of the business can be deducted. What can I deduct from earnings when calculating Carer''s Allowance? You''re allowed to deduct the following: any payments you make to someone (other than a close relative) to look after the  person you normally care for while you''re at work – up to half your net earnings can be ignored this way any payments you make to someone (other than a close relative) to look after your child (or children) under 16 while you''re at work – up to half your net earnings can be ignored this way  the first £20 of any income for renting out rooms in your own home  foster care allowance from a local authority Breaks from caring and earnings In certain circumstances you can take a break from caring and still receive Carer''s Allowance. A break from caring means you spend less than 35 hours a week caring for the person you usually look after. For example, your Carer''s Allowance may be paid for up to four weeks in any 26-week period if: you are going on holiday  the person you care for is going on holiday  the person you care for has a stay in a care home Or your Carer''s Allowance may be paid for up to 12 weeks in any 26-week period if: you are admitted to hospital or a similar institution  the person you care for is admitted to hospital or a similar organisation You must have received Carer''s Allowance for at least 22 weeks before you can take one of these breaks. This entitlement to breaks cannot be saved up. If the person you care for is in hospital for a continual period of more than four weeks, their Disability Living Allowance or Attendance Allowance will stop and so will your Carer''s Allowance. For further details, contact the Carer''s Allowance Unit. How Carer''s Allowance can help you get other benefits Claiming Carer''s Allowance can affect your eligibility for means-tested benefits, including: Income Support, which can top up your income if you don''t have to sign on as being unemployed – for example, if you''re a carer or a lone parent  Income-related Employment and Support Allowance, which can top up your income if you''re under 65 and have a "limited capacity for work" because of ill health or a disability  Income-based Jobseeker''s Allowance, which can top up your income if you''re actively seeking work  Pension Credit, which can top up your income if you''re at or near State Pension age  Housing Benefit, which can help with rent if you have a low income Means-tested benefits are only paid if you have limited income and capital (such as savings). If you get Carer''s Allowance, the carer premium (or carer addition for Pension Credit) will be added when your eligibility for means-tested benefits is worked out. If you would be eligible for Carer''s Allowance but you don''t get it because you get an overlapping benefit, you can still get the carer premium or carer addition. Getting the carer premium or carer addition could mean you''re eligible for more means-tested benefits, or you''re eligible for means-tested benefits when you weren''t before. On the other hand, your eligibility for means-tested benefits depends on your income, so any increase in your income – including getting Carer''s Allowance – could mean you''re no longer eligible or you get less benefit. The best way to find out what you''re entitled to, and how getting Carer''s Allowance could affect this, is to get a full benefits check. Your local Citizens Advice Bureau, welfare rights organisation or carers centre may offer this service. Speak to the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053. Full-time students and Carer''s Allowance If you''re a student in full-time education, you can''t receive Carer''s Allowance. You count as a student if you attend school, college, university or a similar establishment. This could include distance learning with a body such as the Open University. What counts as full-time education? You''ll be considered a full-time student and won''t be able to claim Carer''s Allowance if: the institution where you''re studying describes your course as full-time  your course is officially 21 hours or more a week, excluding breaks and lunch-time If I study full-time, can I claim Carer''s Allowance during holidays? No, you''ll still be treated as if you are in full-time education. Who decides whether the hours I study on my own are a required part of the course? Evidence from the school, college or university will be very important. However, you could argue you''re able to complete the course in fewer hours than would normally be expected – for example, because you have some prior qualification or experience. Some students have successfully appealed against decisions refusing them Carer''s Allowance. If you would like to appeal, get further advice from a welfare benefits adviser. Find out how to claim Carer''s Allowance and how to challenge a Carer''s Allowance decision.

Why is TB still a problem? How common is TB in the UK? Is TB contagious? How do I know if my baby needs the BCG vaccination? I have an allergy. Could anything in the BCG vaccine trigger that allergy? Does the BCG vaccine contain any blood products or materials of animal origin? I live with somebody who has a weakened immune system. If I have the vaccine, is there a risk that the bacteria in the vaccine could infect them? Why do we no longer vaccinate teenagers with the BCG at school? There was no scar or blister after my child''s BCG jab. Did it work?   How well does the vaccine work? The BCG vaccine contains a weakened strain of TB bacteria, which builds up immunity and encourages the body to fight TB if infected with it, without causing the disease itself. The BCG vaccination is thought to protect up to 80% of people for up to 15 years. Why is TB still a problem? It was hoped that with the invention of the BCG vaccine and medicines, it would be possible to wipe out TB in the same way that smallpox has been eradicated. This has turned out to be difficult for a number of reasons: Much of the initial improvement in TB rates in more developed countries was related to improvements in housing, nutrition and access to treatment. But these issues are still present in many countries that are less developed. Several strains of TB bacteria have developed a resistance to one or more anti-TB medications, making them much harder to treat. The BCG vaccination is effective against severe forms of the disease, such as TB meningitis in children, but it is not as effective against all forms of TB. The global epidemic of HIV that began in the 1980s has led to a corresponding epidemic of TB cases. This is because HIV weakens a person''s immune system, making them more likely to develop a TB infection. The rapid growth of international travel has helped the disease to spread. How common is TB in the UK? TB isn''t very common in the UK. There were 6,520 cases of TB in the UK in 2014. Over a third of the infections (39%) were in London and around three-quarters of cases (72%) were in non-UK born people. Is TB contagious? Yes. TB is spread when a person with TB in their lungs or throat, coughs or sneezes and somebody else breathes in the droplets of saliva containing the infection. However, TB is not as infectious as the common cold or flu. You usually need to spend a long time in close contact with an infected person before you catch TB. For example, infections usually spread between family members who are living in the same house. TB cannot be spread through touch, or sharing cutlery, bedding or clothes. Read about how you catch TB. How do I know if my baby needs the BCG vaccination? Your midwife, practice nurse or GP can tell you if a BCG vaccination is recommended for your baby. This NHS leaflet: TB, BCG and your baby has more information. I have an allergy. Could anything in the BCG vaccine trigger that allergy? No. The BCG vaccine is safe for: people who are allergic to latex (a type of rubber) people who are allergic to penicillin people who are allergic to dairy products, eggs and/or nuts However, if you have any concerns, talk to your GP before going ahead with vaccination.  Does the BCG vaccine contain any blood products or materials of animal origin? No. There are no blood products in the vaccine. All of the raw materials used to make the vaccine are from non-animal origins. I live with somebody who has a weakened immune system. If I have the vaccine, is there a risk that I could infect them? No. While the BCG vaccine is not recommended for people with a weakened immune system, they cannot catch TB from someone who has been vaccinated. Why do we no longer vaccinate teenagers with the BCG at school? The BCG is no longer offered to children in secondary schools in the UK. It was replaced in 2005 with a targeted programme for babies, children and young adults at higher risk of TB. This is because TB rates in this country are low. TB is a difficult disease to catch because it requires prolonged exposure to an infected person. For example, you are very unlikely to catch it by sitting or standing next to someone who is infected. Read about who should have the BCG vaccine. There was no scar or blister after my child''s BCG jab. Did it work? A raised blister will appear in most people vaccinated with BCG, but not everyone. If your child did not have this reaction to the vaccine, it does not mean that they have not responded to it. There''s no need to vaccinate with BCG a second time.   Page last reviewed: 26/04/2016 Next review due: 26/04/2018 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

You might be offered CPA support if you: are diagnosed as having a severe mental disorder are at risk of suicide, self-harm, or harm to others tend to neglect yourself and don''t take treatment regularly are vulnerable; this could be for various reasons, such as physical or emotional abuse, financial difficulties because of mental illness or cognitive impairment have misused drugs or alcohol  have learning disabilities rely significantly on the support of a carer, or have your own caring responsibilities have recently been detained under the Mental Health Act have parenting responsibilities have a history of violence or self-harm Anyone experiencing mental health problems is entitled to an assessment of their needs with a mental healthcare professional, and to have a care plan that''s regularly reviewed by that professional. You should also be able to get an assessment of your care and support needs from your local authority to look at your social care needs. How the CPA can help you If you need CPA support, you should be involved in the assessment of your needs and in the development of the plan to meet those needs. You’ll be told about your different choices for care and support services. As a result of the CPA, you should get a formal written care plan that outlines any risks – including details of what should happen in an emergency or crisis. You will have a CPA care co-ordinator (usually a nurse, social worker or occupational therapist) to manage your care plan, and you’ll be given their name and contact details. The care co-ordinator will make sure that the CPA care plan is reviewed regularly. A formal review is made at least once a year, and this will look at your circumstances, including whether CPA support is still needed. If you aren''t eligible for CPA help If you don''t meet the criteria for CPA support, you should still expect assessment of your needs, care planning and reviews of care plans to proceed as normal. These assessments and reviews should also consider whether you should be transferred to CPA support if your needs or condition changes.

The side effects linked with the flu nasal spray vaccine are almost always mild and short-lived. Common side effects of the flu nasal spray vaccine a runny or blocked nose  headache general tiredness  loss of appetite Rare side effects of the flu nasal spray vaccine As with all vaccines, there''s a very small chance of a severe allergic reaction (known medically as anaphylaxis). The overall rate of anaphylaxis after vaccination is around one in 900,000 (so slightly more common than one in a million). Anaphylaxis is very serious but it can be treated with adrenaline. When it happens, it does so within a few minutes of the vaccination. Staff who give vaccinations have all been trained to spot and deal with anaphylactic reactions and children recover completely with treatment. What to do if your child has a side effect from the flu nasal spray vaccine If your child has a runny nose after their flu vaccination, simply wipe their nose with a tissue and then discard it. Serious side effects are uncommon, but if you''re worried about your child, trust your instincts and speak to your doctor or call NHS 111.

They must do this when:  the local authority decides that you, as the parent carer of a disabled child, may have support needs  the local authority receives a request from you to assess your needs for support If the local authority has previously assessed your support needs, they will need to carry out another one if your circumstances or your child’s circumstances have changed. Your local authority must assess whether it is appropriate for you to provide care for your child given your own needs, wishes and wellbeing. They must also take into account your own wellbeing and the wellbeing of your disabled child and their siblings. When assessing you, the local authority must involve you, your child and anyone else whom you wish to be involved. You and anyone else should receive a written record of the assessment, which should include whether the parent and their child have support needs, whether these needs could be met by local authority services, and whether the local authority is able to provide those services. Find out what to do if you disagree with your local authority’s decision. Benefits for parent carers If your local authority has assessed you, they may provide advice on the benefits you can apply for. Although many are funded directly by the government and not the local authority, the local authority can help advise you on how and when to apply. Below are some examples of benefits that parent carers can apply for: If your child has a disability, you may be able to claim Disability Living Allowance for Children on their behalf, from the age of three months old until they are 16 years old. If you earn less than £102 a week (after tax, national insurance and other allowable deductions such as some childcare) and meet the other criteria, you may also be able to get Carer''s Allowance. From April 2015, the threshold is going up to £110. You may be able to apply for a Disabled Facilities Grant from your local authority. This can help to pay for some adaptations that will make your home more suitable for your child’s needs. The Family Fund is a charity that gives grants to low income families who have a severely disabled child. You can find the eligibility criteria on the Family Fund ''who we help'' page. To see what benefits you could be entitled to, use the ‘entitled to’ benefits calculator or get in touch with the Disability Benefits Centre.  The charity Contact a Family also provides advice, information and support to families with disabled children about finances, benefits and debt issues.

ESA is just one of the benefits you may be eligible for if you are of working age and have a disability or long-term condition that limits your ability to work. You can claim it using the ESA claim form. There are two types of ESA: Contributory ESA is payable if you''ve paid enough National Insurance contributions in a set period.  Income-related ESA is a top-up benefit that can be paid on top of contributory ESA, or if your income is too low. The amount of capital you have may affect the amount of income-related ESA you receive. Find out more about contributory and income-related ESA at GOV.UK – What ESA you''ll get. When you''ll receive ESA You will only receive ESA if you are deemed to have limited capability for work. During the first 13 weeks of your claim, you’ll have a Work Capability Assessment. This assessment decides if you have limited capability for work and can qualify for ESA, or if you should claim Jobseeker''s Allowance, or another appropriate benefit. For more details see GOV.UK: How to claim ESA. The ESA scheme pays you a benefit while you''re unable to work. Unless the effects of your illness or disability are severe, you''ll be expected to go back to work at a future date. You will be offered help to cope with the difficulties caused by your illness or disability that prevent you from working. If you receive income-related ESA, you are entitled to other financial help, such as free NHS dental treatment, sight tests, prescriptions and housing grants. Work-focused interviews for ESA As part of your ESA claim, you may be required to attend work-focused interviews. This will depend on the outcome of your Work Capability Assessment. You won’t be required to attend a work-focused interview if you’re placed in the ESA support group, or if you’ve reached the qualifying age for Pension Credit. You can find out your qualifying age for Pension Credit on GOV.UK. You can ask for a work-focused interview to be put off (deferred) to another date if the initial time doesn''t suit you. For example, if you''re a full-time carer, an interview can be deferred if it clashes with your caring responsibilities. Your circumstances will be considered, and it may be agreed that you don''t need to attend a work-focused interview for the time being. You can ask for a work-focused interview to take place in your home if attending one elsewhere would cause you great difficulty. If a work-focused interview is not deferred but you can''t attend it (for example, if care arrangements fall through), you must tell Jobcentre Plus your reasons within five working days of being notified that you failed to attend the interview. Your ESA won''t be subject to sanctions in this situation. At a work-focused interview, your circumstances will be taken into account when discussing what work-related activity, if any, is appropriate for you. If a decision is made to reduce your benefit because you did not attend a work-focused interview, you have the right to appeal, after asking for the decision to be looked at again first. See GOV.UK: How to appeal for more information. The government''s official online source of information on ESA is GOV.UK.

Your first step to getting this sort of help should be to ask your local authority social services department for an assessment of your needs. This assessment will help you decide on the type of services you may want, as well as helping the local authority understand which services you need. Your local authority may be able to offer you some care services for free. It’s worth finding out if you can get free services from your local authority because the cost of buying care services is likely to be high if you have long-term care needs, and they could increase as you get older. For more information, read about funding your care. How to get social services from your local authority Local authorities have a duty to assess anyone who appears to have care and support needs. Your local authority should: assess your needs and give you advice, whatever your financial circumstances provide information about services and support options available to you in your area give you a carer’s assessment if you are an unpaid/family carer The assessment by the local authority is important because it helps them work out what your difficulties are and what services will help you most. For more information, read What social care services are available? Next steps after a care needs assessment If your local authority decides you are eligible for social care support, they will carry out a financial assessment to determine how much you will need to pay towards your care, if anything. After this, if you are eligible for care and support, social services or an independent adviser will work with you to create a care and support plan. Often, only minor assistance is needed – such as meals on wheels and help with washing or dressing, yet these services could make a big difference to your life. If you feel that your needs have changed over time, you can request a review of your care plan, or a re-assessment if you were not originally eligible for care and support. Contact the social care team at your local authority to discuss this. Your social care rights and entitlements Under UK law, you should be looked after and treated fairly and with dignity whenever you are given social care services. This applies to everyone, regardless of where they are given care and who does the caring. This comes under the UK Human Rights Act. Several rights may apply because of this law, including the right to: life liberty respect for private and family life, home and correspondence not be treated in an inhuman or degrading way Other laws may also protect you from discrimination because of who you are, including some protection for carers under the rules designed to protect disabled people. For example, if you are an older person, this should not stop you from having treatment similar to that which a younger person would be given. In most cases, you shouldn’t have to actively exert your rights about the care you receive. However, if you feel you are being unjustly treated in breach of your rights, you may want to take action. You can do this by telling someone you trust, seeking help from an advocacy service, or contacting the local authority team in charge of "safeguarding". Find out about safeguarding on the Care Quality Commission website. Find out how the Equality Act and the Mental Capacity Act protect your rights to be treated fairly, and make your own decisions wherever possible. When things go wrong with social care At times, things may go wrong with your care. You may find that: you disagree with a decision about your care you disagree with the outcome of an assessment you believe standards or quality of care have been poor you believe the amount of care you have got has not been enough you believe the costs of care are unfair you feel that staff have behaved badly or inappropriately However, you should be actively involved in the care and support process – for example, during the assessment and in developing the care and support plan. The council must attempt to reasonably agree any course of action with you and anyone else you request. You should make the council aware of anything that you are not happy with during these discussions. Give feedback on care services If you have been using homecare services, a care home or a nursing home, you can leave good or negative feedback on their services. These comments will be publicly available on the service’s online profile and they will be asked to publicly respond to the comments. However, if that doesn’t get a result, you may wish to make a formal complaint. Whoever is providing your care services will, by law, have a complaints procedure available. This should be your first step in trying to address what has gone wrong. Friends and relatives may be able to help you with a complaint, as can the Citizen’s Advice Bureau and many other charities. If you have been seriously abused, you should call the police. You may want to speak with the "safeguarding" team at your local authority. If your complaint is about a private or voluntary care provider, contact the Care Quality Commission. For more information, find out how to make a complaint.

(63, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/reporting-side-effects.aspx', NULL, 'What to do about vaccine side effects - Vaccinations - NHS Choices', '', 'It''s natural to be concerned that you or your child will have a side effect after having a vaccination. While all vaccines have the potential to cause side effects in some people, the reality is that most tend to be mild and don''t last longer than a few days. Some people don''t get any side effects at all. Common vaccine side effects Common side effects of any vaccine can include: injection site reactions (pain, swelling and redness) mild fever shivering fatigue headache muscle and joint pain Rare vaccine side effects A far less common, but serious, vaccine side effect is an immediate allergic reaction, also known as an anaphylactic reaction. These are dramatic and potentially life-threatening. However, they are very rare – occurring in less than one in a million cases – and are completely reversible if treated promptly by healthcare staff. To have a balanced view, potential side effects have to be weighed against the expected benefits of vaccination in preventing the serious complications of disease. Read more about the benefits and risks of vaccination. Not all illnesses that occur after vaccination will be a side effect. Because millions of people every year are vaccinated, it''s inevitable that some will go on to develop a coincidental infection or illness shortly afterwards. What to do if your child is unwell after having a vaccination Most common side effects in babies and young children are at the site of the injection, and include: swelling redness a small hard lump These symptoms usually pass within a couple of days and you don''t need to do anything about them. Children may sometimes develop a high temperature (fever). If this happens, keep your child cool. Make sure they don''t wear too many layers of clothes or blankets and give them plenty of cool drinks. You can also give them a dose of infant paracetamol or ibuprofen liquid according to the instructions on the bottle. Read an NHS leaflet about the common side effects of vaccinations that may occur in babies and children under the age of five (PDF, 118kb), and how to treat them. Find out about a vaccine''s side effects A patient information leaflet (PIL) is included in the pack of each dose of vaccine, and lists its potential side effects. You can also read vaccine PILs online on the electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC) website. Reporting a vaccine side effect If you, a doctor, nurse or pharmacist suspects that you or your child has had a possible side effect to a vaccine, it can be reported through the Yellow Card Scheme. The Yellow Card Scheme is run by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and is designed to pick up unexpected problems or new side effects. If a serious new side effect is identified, the MHRA will follow up the report. It may change the way a vaccine is used, or it may even be taken off the market. How to use the Yellow Card Scheme Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about the suspected side effect, and they''ll report it for you. Alternatively, you can report it yourself by: using the Yellow Card Scheme online reporting system picking up a Yellow Card form at your GP surgery or local pharmacy – complete the form and send it to the address provided calling the Yellow Card freephone hotline on 0808 100 3352, Monday to Friday, 10am to 2pm Now, read more about the safety of vaccinations, or about the side effects of each vaccine: side effects of the 5-in-1 infant vaccine side effects of the 4-in-1 pre-school booster side effects of the 3-in-1 teenage booster side effects of the MMR vaccine side effects of the chickenpox vaccine side effects of the Men C vaccine side effects of the Men B vaccine side effects of the Men ACWY vaccine side effects of the Hib/Men C booster side effects of the pneumococcal vaccine side effects of the HPV (cervical cancer) vaccine side effects of the BCG vaccine side effects of the flu vaccine side effects of the children''s flu vaccine side effects of the rotavirus vaccine side effects of the shingles vaccine Page last reviewed: 07/04/2016 Next review due: 07/04/2018 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Caring for a parent at home Media last reviewed: 28/05/2015 Next review due: 28/05/2017 If you care for someone who doesn’t live with you, the time may come when you start thinking about sharing your home with them. This might be because they''ll need more care in the future if their condition gets worse, or they''ve recently come out of hospital after an illness or fall.  There can be many benefits to welcoming someone you care for into your home. Not only can you enjoy having more time together, you can also benefit from the peace of mind that comes with knowing they’re not on their own. However, it’s important to think about your relationship with the person you care for. If the relationship has been strained in the past, it''s likely to become more difficult if you share a home. For advice and support when taking this decision, you could call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053 to talk through your situation. Financial and legal considerations with sharing a home When you share your home, there may be legal and financial considerations, particularly if the person you care for has sold their house to move in with you, and is contributing towards the costs of your home. The number of people living in your home, and their income, can affect your benefits and Council Tax discounts. Make sure that everyone is clear about their rights and responsibilities. You could sign a written agreement, which details who pays which bills, and what will happen if the person you care for stops living with you. If you draw up an agreement of this kind, you might want to get legal advice. See the Citizens Advice Bureau website. If you are moving in with the person you care for, you also need to check whether this impacts your own benefits, if you have them. You should tell whoever pays your benefit about a change in circumstances – for example, if you are currently claiming Housing Benefit, you’ll need to tell your local council. If the person wants to gift you their home, there are legal and practical implications to consider, as this guide on the legal transfer of property from Which? Elderly Care shows. Most carers are entitled to an assessment of their own needs, which will determine whether social services should help them. Help with care may also be available from other sources, such as voluntary organisations or other family members. Practical considerations with sharing your home Think about whether your home is suitable for the person you care for. For example, if they use a wheelchair, do you have stairs or a lift? You may have to adapt your home. Your local authority may help you pay for this. Consider how day-to-day living arrangements would work, and how other people living in the house might be affected. What might happen in the future? Is the person you look after likely to need more care? If so, will it be practical for you to provide more care in your home? It''s not always possible to know how long somebody may need care. It could be weeks or years. Can you commit to this? If their condition got worse, for example, and they had to move to a care home for a while, how would another stressful move affect them?  If the person you care for is meeting the costs of their care, this could have implications for how much they are asked to contribute. For example if they decide to sell their home. If the person you care for is used to having their own independence and privacy, they''re likely to want to continue that. Privacy may also be important to you and other people who live in your home. Agree to some ground rules before the move takes place. Options other than sharing your home If the person you look after would like to stay in their own home, they might be able to get help that would enable them to continue living independently. A community care assessment will decide whether they can be assisted by social services. If the person you look after finds it difficult to live on their own, you could both look at other housing options that might be more appropriate. Sheltered housing or retirement housing  There are many different types of sheltered/retirement housing to rent and to buy, through local authorities and housing associations and in the private market. Most sheltered/retirement housing schemes have a warden or scheme manager, and an emergency alarm service. This type of housing appeals to people who like living independently but want the reassurance of knowing that there is assistance on hand. Although wardens don''t usually provide care, they can direct residents to local services and any additional support available from the local authority or voluntary organisations. Housing with Care or extra care housing  Housing with Care, also known as extra care housing, is a relatively new form of specialised housing for older people. Housing with Care properties can be rented, owned and part-owned/part-rented. They are self-contained homes, with one or two bedrooms, and are designed to provide enough support as and when it is needed. Types of services and facilities will vary, and may include, for example, 24-hour staffing, personal care and domestic help. Care homes  Care homes are accommodation focused on providing care, either personal care, nursing care and/or dementia care. They will provide a room, often with ensuite facilities, communal areas, and services will include meals, help with medication, and 24 hour support. If the person’s local authority is responsible for meeting their needs, they have a right to choose the care home they live in. However, if they wish to choose a care home that is more expensive than the one the local authority would choose, they can, but the extra cost of that care home would need to be met. In 2015/16 this will need to be by a third party, such as family, friends or a charity. From 2016/17, when the point at which means-tested support for the costs of care is raised, this could be by the person themselves. This is because currently a person can only top up their own care home fees if they have a deferred payment agreement (DPA) in place or are benefiting from a 12-week “property disregard” (this is where a person’s property has been included in the person’s financial assessment, but its value is disregarded for the first 12 weeks they are in a care home so they have some space to decide whether they want to sell it or apply for a DPA). From 2016 these restrictions will be removed.  Staying with friends Staying with friends may be an option while someone looks for temporary or permanent housing. A friend is likely to be more aware of the person''s needs and situation. But if this is an informal arrangement, there will be no legal contract in place, and the person has no rights to stay there. More information Which? Elderly Care has a guide for people thinking about sharing their home with a relative.  Which? Elderly Care also offers advice on talking to your relative about care options.

(66, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cradle-cap/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Cradle cap', 'Cradle cap - NHS Choices', 'Cradle cap  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', '  Cradle cap is the greasy, yellow scaly patches that sometimes appear on the scalps of young babies. It''s a common harmless condition that doesn''t usually itch or cause discomfort to the baby. If your baby is scratching their head or there is swelling, speak to your GP as it may be a sign of another condition, such as atopic eczema. The medical name for cradle cap is seborrhoeic dermatitis. It usually occurs on the scalp, but can also appear on the face, ears, neck, nappy area or in skin folds, such as at the back of the knees and armpits. Cradle cap usually appears in babies in the first two months and tends to clear up by itself after a few weeks or months. In most cases, it will clear by the time your baby is one year old. What does cradle cap look like? Cradle cap is easy to recognise by the large, greasy, yellow or brown scales on your baby''s scalp. The scales will start to flake and may make the affected skin look red. Sometimes the hair will come away with the flakes, but it will grow back. What causes cradle cap? It''s not clear what causes cradle cap, although it may be linked to overactive sebaceous glands. These are glands in the skin that produce an oily substance called sebum. Some babies are thought to retain some of their mother''s hormones in their bodies for several weeks or months after their birth. These hormones may make the baby''s glands produce more sebum. Cradle cap isn''t contagious and it isn''t caused by poor hygiene or an allergy. It doesn''t mean the baby isn''t being looked after properly or has an infection. Babies with cradle cap may be more likely to develop dandruff, which is another type of seborrhoeic dermatitis, when they''re older. Does cradle cap need treatment? Most cases of cradle cap will clear up on their own in time. Gently washing your baby''s hair and scalp with baby shampoo can help prevent a build-up of scales. Massaging baby oil or natural oil, such as olive oil, into their scalp at night can help loosen the crust. There is usually no need to see your GP if your baby has cradle cap. However, you may want to ask them for advice if your baby''s scalp becomes inflamed or if the cradle cap spreads to other parts of their body.  It''s important not to pick at the scales as this can cause an infection. Special shampoos You can buy special shampoo for cradle cap from your local pharmacy. Always read the instruction leaflet to check it''s safe to use on your child. Avoid getting the shampoo in your baby''s eyes. If you''re unsure about using it, speak to a pharmacist for advice. Generally, don''t use shampoos that contain groundnut oil or peanut oil on children under five years of age. See your GP if your baby''s cradle cap is severe, if there is swelling or bleeding, or if there are signs of cradle cap on their face or body. Treating an infection If your baby''s cradle cap becomes inflamed or infected, a course of antibiotics or an antifungal cream or shampoo such as ketoconazole may be prescribed by a doctor. A mild steroid cream such as hydrocortisone may also be recommended for an inflamed rash.

Read on or click on the links below for more information: Support after diagnosis Your child’s medical needs Daily living with a disabled child Lifelong care for a disabled child Support after diagnosis Although everyone''s experience will be different, it can be reassuring to speak to other parents who have children with the same disability or condition as yours. They''re likely to have been through the same emotions and processes as you. Many organisations have online forums or message boards for parents. The charity Bliss can provide advice and support to families with a baby in special care. There also may be local groups for parent carers in your area. If you want to speak to an adviser about support services for parent carers, you can contact Carers Direct on 0300 123 1053 from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday, and 11am to 4pm at weekends (closed bank holidays). Or you can use the textphone/minicom number 0300 123 1004. GP carers register If your GP’s surgery has a carers register, ask to be included on it. If your GP knows that you’re a carer, they can keep an eye on your own health and you’ll have someone you can speak to in confidence about how you’re feeling. They can also advise on local organisations and carers services that may benefit both you and your child now and in the future. Learn about your child''s condition Once you have a clear diagnosis, you''ll probably want to find out as much about the condition as you can. When researching online, look out for the Information Standard mark, which confirms that the information is reliable. Also:  You can also contact condition-specific organisations for advice and guidance on your child''s condition, such as the Down’s Syndrome Association.

If your child needs regular healthcare treatment at home, your family may be supported by community children’s nurses. These nurses can also help you with any treatment that you need to carry out for your child, such as giving oxygen or administering injections. The health professionals involved in your child’s care should be available to talk to you. If you have questions or concerns, it can be helpful to write these down before you meet. You could also ask them to give you any information both verbally and in writing. Building a trusted relationship with someone who works closely with your child can be a valuable source of support. Your child may receive a ''continuing care package'' if they have needs arising from disability, accident or illness that can''t be met by existing universal or specialist services alone. The package could include a range of services commissioned by local authority children’s services and sometimes others. Find out more about continuing care for children and young people.

This could include equipment for daily living, care for your child at home, access to play schemes and respite care so that you can get a break. To access services from your local authority, you''ll need to ask for a needs assessment. Your needs, and the rest of your family’s, can be taken into account during your child’s assessment.

This includes changing the number of hours you work, the days or times you work, or applying for job share. Grandparent carers Grandparents sometimes assume full-time care of their grandchildren. Looking after children can be a physical and financial strain at any age, but particularly so if you are older. Advice and support on being the sole carer of a grandchild is available from grandparent organisations such as The Grandparents'' Association or Grandparents Plus. Lifelong care for a disabled child It''s natural to be concerned about your child''s future if they are born with an illness or disability, or diagnosed at an early age. It''s worth asking your local authority for an assessment of your child''s needs, as well as your own needs as a carer. The local authority should consider the needs of your whole family, especially if you have other children who may be young carers themselves. To find out about assessments, call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053. Find contact details for your local authority. Independence in adulthood Many young people who have disabilities live independent lives, while others may always need significant care. Even if they have high caring needs, with the right support your child may still be able to live independently. The video on this page shows how Victoria, who has profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, lives in her own home and employs her own personal assistants. Many organisations can offer advice about managing a young person''s transition into adulthood. You can find contact details for these organisations in the directory of local carers'' services. What will happen to my child after I die? You may want to plan ahead for your child’s future and make sure things are in place in case they outlive you. If your child has a physical disability, they might need someone to help them with personal care or transportation. If your child has learning disabilities, they may require specialist provisions such as sheltered housing, care homes or specialist nursing care. Making a plan for their future will ensure that your child will continue to be looked after without interruption if you die. By planning this in advance you will be able to arrange care that meets your expectations. Make a will Writing a will can help you address all the fears you may have about what will happen to your children when you die. You can write a will through a solicitor, using a will writing pack or using online will writing services. Whichever option you choose you should research the requirements and decide whether you are confident about writing the will for yourself or if you would like to have professional help. You might have family or friends who could care for your child in an emergency or would be willing to look after your son or daughter if you die. If this is the case you may want to make a will explaining your wishes for your child. It’s also a good idea to let social services know about this in advance and to include them in an emergency care plan. If friends and family can’t help out, speak to social services about the best options for your child. Written instructions It will help your child and those who may need to care for your child if they know exactly what has to be done each day. You could keep a log of the food and drinks that your child likes and dislikes, what time they wake up and go to bed, what time they need their medication and so on. Doing this will make life easier for your child and their new carer. Care plans A care plan is a good way to ensure that if you fall ill and are unable to care for your child, or if you die, your child will be properly looked after. Even if you have made arrangements for emergencies, it is essential to make an emergency care plan for your child’s care, especially if they have complex needs. The care plan should include your child’s details, medical requirements and contact names and numbers in case of an emergency. Your local authority will help you develop an emergency care plan when they carry out an assessment for your child under the Children Act.

What are care and support services? Care and support services, also known as social care services, help people who are in need of practical support due to illness, disability, old age or a low income.  Care and support services could include having a personal assistant to help you around the home, structural changes to help you move around or manage in your house, or even an alarm system so that you can call for help if you have a fall. Social care services are available to everyone, regardless of their background. However, social care is subject to rules about your needs and ability. Services can also support the families or carers of people who receive social care. Find out more about your rights and entitlements to social care. How are care and support services funded? Local authorities (councils) are responsible for providing social care services for those who need them and are eligible for them. After assessing your needs and finances, the local authority may agree to pay for some or all of the care and support you need. These council-funded social care services may be provided by ‘independent providers’ – firms or charities that specialise in providing social care services. Find out more about funding care services. Even though most people have to fund all or part of their own care and support, local authorities have a duty to assess everyone’s care and support needs, and advise you on relevant local services. Social care services can take many forms – you can get help from them while you live at home, out and about in the community, or even in a new place of residence such as a care home. To find out more, read choosing care and arranging care. How can social care help disabled people? Social care services can help and support people with disabilities to live more independently. Even if you are not eligible for free social care, you may still have a right to receive benefits and other financial help or access to equipment and concessions on transport or the Blue Badge Parking Scheme. Details on these, together with information on disability rights under the Equality Act and in the workplace, can be found in this guide and on GOV.UK. Read more about living with a disability with help from social care services. How can social care help older people? Most local authorities will have a social care team devoted to older people. These teams can provide support that enables older people to remain living independently in their own home. The local authority''s team for older people will also be able to guide you through the options available if you are no longer able to live at home independently, for instance in sheltered accommodation, extra care housing, or care and nursing homes. I look after someone. Can social care help me? If you are looking after an ill, disabled or frail elderly relative or friend, you should recognise yourself as a carer. Carers can get a range of support from social care, and can be vital for helping arrange social care support for the person they care for. There are charities that support particular groups of carers, including sibling carers and young carers. If you want to talk to someone about how to get support as a carer, call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053. How can social care help my child? If you''re worried about your child''s general development or wellbeing and you think they need additional support, you should speak to your child’s GP or teacher first. If you or your child need more significant support, contact the children’s services team in your local authority for a needs assessment. This assessment of your child’s needs will be used to determine if they need more specialised support, including any special educational needs your child may have. You should be involved in any decisions about your child, including what help will be provided to meet their needs. This guide also provides tips for caring for a disabled child and links to further help. Council help for children Each local authority will have people dealing specifically with social care for children. Use the GOV.UK website to find your local council and get advice about an assessment for children’s services. How good are my local authority social services? If you are receiving care, looking after someone who receives care, or just planning for your future care, it’s worth finding out how well your local authority’s social care services are performing. You can check how care services in your area are performing against measures in the Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (ASCOF). This will let you find out how carers and people receiving local authority funded care and support in your area rate: their quality of life  their satisfaction with care services  feeling safe Alongside these are the levels of social services that the local authority offers, such as: the number of people receiving direct payments  the number of permanent admissions to care homes delayed transfers of care from hospitals You can also compare these with national and regional averages, to see whether your local authority is doing well, or could be performing better.

(70, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/vaccination-saves-lives.aspx', NULL, 'How vaccination saves lives - Vaccinations - NHS Choices', '', 'Because of vaccinations, we no longer see smallpox, and polio has almost been eradicated. No wonder vaccination is considered a modern miracle. Vaccination is one of the greatest breakthroughs in modern medicine. No other medical intervention has done more to save lives and improve quality of life. Smallpox eradication Smallpox ravaged and killed thousands of people in Europe in the 18th century. Once a person had caught it, the disease would kill around a third of victims and leave survivors scarred or blinded. Thankfully, smallpox was officially wiped out in 1980. If it were still common, it would cause an estimated 2 million deaths every year around the world. Polio eradication The incurable and deadly disease of polio has also been eradicated from much of the world, including the UK, the rest of Europe, the western Pacific and the Americas. Polio, which is caused by a virus that destroys nerve cells, used to threaten millions of people worldwide. At its peak, more than 1,000 children a day were paralysed by polio globally. Up to 1 in 1,000 children and 1 in 75 adults who caught the infection were paralysed – not only in their arms or legs, but also their breathing muscles, which put them at risk of suffocation. The only way to keep children with polio-induced respiratory problems alive was to put them in a giant metal machine, called an "iron lung", to help them breathe. Hospital wards with children in iron lungs were common just 50 years ago. Whooping cough and diphtheria Thanks to the NHS and its childhood vaccination programme, children in the UK are now protected against many dangerous diseases. As well as polio, this includes many other potentially deadly infections, such as diphtheria and whooping cough. In 1940, there were more than 60,000 cases and 3,283 deaths from diphtheria in the UK. By 2002, vaccination had almost eliminated it – there were just two deaths from diphtheria between 1986 and 2002. Before the 1950s, the UK had an average of 120,000 cases of whooping cough each year. After vaccination, between 2000 and 2011 there were fewer than 1,500 cases each year. Meningitis C Meningitis C has been virtually eliminated since the men C vaccine was introduced in the UK in 1999. The UK was the first country in the world to offer the jab. There has been a 99% reduction in cases of meningitis C among those aged under 20 since vaccination started. In 1998, the year before the vaccine was introduced, there were 78 deaths among under-18s in the UK. There were just two deaths between mid-2011 and mid-2012. Why we still need vaccines All these diseases are now so rare that it''s easy to underestimate the importance of children''s vaccinations. However, whooping cough and diphtheria are still a threat. The diseases may be rare now, but if children aren''t vaccinated, they can return with a vengeance. After a scare about the safety of the whooping cough vaccine in the 1970s and 80s, parents stopped vaccinating their children against the disease. This led to three epidemics, and at least 100 children died after catching the disease. When Russia''s childhood vaccination programme collapsed during the break-up of the Soviet Union, it triggered a mass epidemic of diphtheria. New vaccines Since 2013, five new vaccines have been introduced into the NHS routine vaccination programme: childrens'' flu vaccine – given as a nasal spray rotavirus vaccine – for babies shingles vaccine – for 70-year-olds plus  men B vaccine – for babies men ACWY vaccine - for teenagers and students  The future of vaccination There will be many more potentially lifesaving vaccines in the years to come. Research is thriving, with more than 150 new vaccines currently being tested. We will soon have an improved pneumococcal vaccine that offers protection against more strains of the disease, and there''s promising work on longer-lasting vaccines against flu. Find out which vaccinations you and your family are eligible for on the NHS by using our vaccination checklist.

The Care Act and what it means for me Media last reviewed: 30/09/2015 Next review due: 30/09/2017 Your carer''s assessment may identify that you need a break from caring from time to time. Equally, the person you care for may also want to have a break without you. See Accessible day trips and activities for help planning their trip. Replacement care and respite care Replacement care is designed to replace the care that you, as a carer, would normally be giving the person you care for. It may be needed so you can look after your own health and wellbeing, and to take a break from caring. For example, it may be that regular replacement overnight care is needed so you can catch up on your own sleep. In certain situations, respite (temporary) care may be provided by your local authority after your carer''s assessment or after the person you care for has had an assessment. You can use the directory of local carers'' services to find your nearest local carers'' centre or respite service. Your local authority or local carers'' centre can give you information about local support. Carer''s tip from Scope "Some hospices provide respite care; we have found this very helpful. They offer high-level care, which means you can feel comfortable your family member is being cared for properly." Breaks for carers After your carer''s assessment, you may agree with your local authority that you need a break as part of your support plan. If the local authority has agreed to fund the breaks in your care plan, you should be able to choose how you can get your break. Using direct payments to get time off caring After your assessment, if you are eligible for support, your local authority will develop a support plan with you. This will include a personal budget, which you can choose to have as a direct payment. For example, you may choose to:  hire a care worker through an agency so you can go on a shopping trip use the direct payment to pay for a supported holiday for both you and the person you care for – the Short Breaks Network can provide more information on this Alternatives to direct payments You may also want to consider funding or getting a break from caring by: asking for care organised by your local authority getting funding from a benevolent fund or charity paying for a break yourself accessing bursaries and low-cost holidays getting leisure discounts asking friends and family to help Replacement care provided by the local authority Instead of a direct payment, you could ask the local authority to arrange services for you so you can have a break. You can also use a direct payment to fund traditional forms of respite care, and you can pool your direct payments with other people''s to fund services such as day centres. Some local authorities provide vouchers (sometimes called respite grants, or carers'' grants) that can be exchanged for services, such as those offered by care agencies or residential homes. You might be able to use vouchers to pay for extra costs associated with your holiday, including live-in care workers, short-stay residential care, or the cost of more homecare. You might want to consider: homecare services – these can either be day services that give you the chance to do an activity inside or outside the home, or night services that can help you get a proper night''s sleep, or helpers coming to the home of the person you''re caring for. Different types of help can be organised, including sitting with the person you care for and keeping them company, preparing meals, and helping them to get up, washed and dressed. The care workers who come to your home can also provide social activities, such as taking the person you care for to the cinema, pub or shopping. residential or nursing care – this is where the person you''re looking after goes for a short stay in a residential or nursing home. If you can, visit the care or nursing home beforehand so you can see what it''s like.  day care – this is where the person you''re looking after goes to a day centre or takes part in activities away from home. If the replacement care provided is essentially a homecare service for the person needing care and allows you to take a break, it should be considered a service provided to the cared-for person and should therefore be charged to them, not you as the carer. Find out more in Carer''s assessment. Benevolent funds or charity funding You may be able to get help with the cost of going on holiday – either alone or with the person you care for – from a charity or benevolent fund. Your social worker, GP, health visitor or local carers'' support group can give you more information on local benevolent funds and other possible sources of funding. You might find help from the following: Saga Respite for Carers Trust provides a limited number of free holidays each year for carers over the age of 50 and the people they look after. The Family Fund can provide grants towards the cost of holidays for families on a low income who are caring for a child with a severe disability. The Family Holiday Association is a UK charity providing breaks at holiday sites, or grants to help with the cost of a holiday, to low-income families in need of a holiday away from home. You need to be referred by your social worker, GP or health visitor, or by a charity or other welfare agent. The Children''s Country Holiday Fund provides respite breaks in the countryside for young carers aged 6 to 16 and disadvantaged children and young people. Paying for your own breaks If after a carer''s assessment the local authority decides it will not fund a break for you, you can still decide to pay for your own break from caring. How you go about this will depend on your budget and the care options available to you locally. Bursaries and low-cost holidays Some charities offer low-cost holidays or bursaries to families. The national charity Diabetes UK offers support holidays for families and young people. Holidays are low cost and a bursary can be offered to families who can''t afford the travel costs to the UK holiday site. Further information can be found on the Diabetes UK website or on 020 7424 1000 (ask for the care support team). Turn2us, an independent charity, can help you find sources of financial support based on your particular needs and circumstances. Saga, the organisation for people aged 50 and older, has a range of holidays and short breaks to suit carers, including group holidays, holidays for single travellers, special interest holidays, and cruises. Holidays are run throughout the year in the UK and abroad. Saga also offers free holidays for carers through the Saga Respite for Carers Trust. Leisure discounts Many local authorities offer leisure cards. These can help you pay for activities you might like to do when you get a break from caring. They''re often available to people claiming benefits such as Income Support, Employment and Support Allowance, Carer''s Allowance and benefits for disabled people, students over 18 in full-time education, and people over 60. The eligibility requirements vary between areas, but there''s a good chance you''ll qualify if you''re a carer with a low income. Local authorities might make a small annual charge for the card, from £1 up to around £15. You''ll probably be asked for some proof of your entitlement, such as a statement of entitlement for Income Support or an official letter. Discount leisure cards can give you discounts of between 10 and 50% on activities, services and entertainment. These range from sporting activities at local leisure centres to cinemas, theatres, libraries, museums, hairdressers and beauty salons. Help with caring from friends and family Friends and family can provide support for you and the person you care for, especially when you need a break from caring. However, they are not the same as paid professional care workers, and regular caring can place the same stresses on them as on you. They may also be unable or unwilling to commit to giving you a break when you need it. Make sure anyone who takes over from you has all the information they need to look after the person you care for. This may include what they like to eat and at what time, as well as more complex information about the medicines they need to take. Leave a clear list of contacts. These should include the doctor''s number, those of nearby family members and friends, and your own number in case of emergencies. If you have an emergency plan, go through it with the people who will be providing replacement care. If the person you care for needs specialist medical or nursing help while you''re away, arrange this through their GP. This specialist help can include visits from a district nurse or from a community psychiatric nurse. There is no charge for this healthcare, but each NHS body decides what care it will provide. Help with emergency planning Thinking about what you would do in an emergency should be part of the discussion you have as part of your carer''s assessment. The person who carries out your assessment should be able to help you with planning. Carer''s tip from Scope "It might be a good idea to choose someone from your family to be the person''s guardian in case of death. You should ensure that person is familiar, and keep them up-to-date with needs." To create an emergency plan, you will need to note down details of: the name, address and any other contact details of the person you look after who you and the person you look after would like to be contacted in an emergency – this could be friends, family or professional people involved in the person''s care any medication the person is taking any ongoing treatment they need You can register with a carers emergency scheme in your area. If you do, a skilled worker trained to look at your individual situation may be able to help you make your emergency plans. Who can help make an emergency plan? Every carer who has an assessment should be asked about emergencies and offered help to plan for them. The social worker involved in your carer''s assessment should be able to help you with emergency planning.

It''s administered by your local authority. It can be paid whether you''re in council or private housing, and you can claim it whether you''re in or out of work. Find out more about eligibility for Housing Benefit, how to claim or appeal a decision, and what you''ll get on GOV.UK: Housing Benefit. Housing Benefit doesn''t help with mortgages. If you''re a homeowner, the only benefits that assist with mortgage costs are Income Support, income-based Jobseeker''s Allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, and Pension Credit. Housing Benefit can help with housing costs such as: rent fees for lodgings some service charges mooring charges/berthing fees for a houseboat site rental for a caravan or mobile home almshouse contributions Eligibility for Housing Benefit You won’t be eligible for Housing Benefit if your income or capital (such as savings, shares or property) are above set limits. However, there''s an exception to these rules: if you get the Guarantee Credit part of Pension Credit, you''ll receive the maximum amount of Housing Benefit for which you are eligible, even if you have savings above the capital limits. For more information, see Housing Benefit: What you''ll get on GOV.UK. If your income is very low or you''re on certain benefits, you''ll get the maximum Housing Benefit to which you are entitled. You’ll get less than the maximum Housing Benefit if your income is higher. Even if you get maximum Housing Benefit, your rent may not be paid in total because there may be items in your rent that are "ineligible" and Housing Benefit can''t be paid for them. Also, if you live in a property that''s been assessed as too large for your needs, you won’t receive the full amount. If you rent in the private sector, your benefit may be calculated under the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) rules. You can claim Housing Benefit at any age, but the amount of benefit you receive can depend on how old you are. How much Housing Benefit you get will also be affected by your income and capital, and whether you''re claiming as a single person, for you and your family, or as part of a couple. You may receive higher levels of benefit if you''re disabled or you''re a carer. LHA for private tenants If you rent in the private sector, the maximum amount of Housing Benefit you can get is decided under the LHA rules. The amount of LHA you get depends on the area where you live and the number of people who live in your home, although the maximum rate is for four-bedroom properties. The maximum benefit you can get is decided by allocating one bedroom in a property for: every adult couple  any other adult aged 16 or over  any two children aged under 10 regardless of sex  any two children of the same sex up to the age of 16  any other child LHA is worked out by looking at the highest and lowest reasonable rents for an area, provided that the accommodation is in a reasonable state of repair. From this, the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) works out the lowest third of reasonable rents in the area. Allowances are calculated monthly and are made public so that you know in advance the amount of Housing Benefit you''ll be paid. You can find the latest LHA rates on your local authority''s website or on the VOA website. If you’re single, under 35 and sharing accommodation (for example, you have your own bedroom, but share a kitchen, bathroom and living space), you will get a "shared rate".   How long does LHA last? The allowance is set from the day that you apply for LHA. This will then apply for 12 months, unless you have a change of circumstances (for example, if more people move in with you). At the end of the year, the decision is looked at again and you don''t have to make a new claim for LHA. How LHA is paid Payments will usually be made directly into your bank or building society account. However, payment can be made directly to your landlord if you''re a "vulnerable" person and are: unable to manage your money unlikely to pay have more than eight weeks'' rent arrears If LHA doesn''t yet apply to you, there may be other restrictions on your maximum rent for Housing Benefit. If you change address and move into accommodation rented from a private landlord, you''ll be moved on to LHA at this point. If you are struggling to meet your housing costs, your local authority may be able to help with a "discretionary housing payment", which could help with a rent deposit if you needed to move accommodation.

(76, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/constipation/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Constipation', 'Constipation - NHS Choices', 'Constipation  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Constipation is a common condition that affects people of all ages. It can mean that you''re not passing stools regularly or you''re unable to completely empty your bowel. Constipation can also cause your stools to be hard and lumpy, as well as unusually large or small. The severity of constipation varies from person to person. Many people only experience constipation for a short time, but for others, constipation can be a long-term (chronic) condition that causes significant pain and discomfort and affects quality of life. Read more about the symptoms of constipation. What causes constipation? It''s often difficult to identify the exact cause of constipation. However, there are a number of things that contribute to the condition, including: not eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals a change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits ignoring the urge to pass stools side effects of certain medications not drinking enough fluids anxiety or depression In children, poor diet, fear about using the toilet and problems toilet training can all lead to constipation. Read more about the causes of constipation. Who''s affected Constipation can occur in babies, children and adults. It''s estimated that around one in every seven adults and up to one in every three children in the UK has constipation at any one time. The condition affects twice as many women as men and is also more common in older adults and during pregnancy. When to see your GP You may be able to treat constipation yourself by making simple changes to your diet and lifestyle (see below). If these changes don''t help and the problem continues, you should see your GP. Also speak to your GP if you think your child might be constipated. Read more about diagnosing constipation. Treating constipation Diet and lifestyle changes are usually recommended as the first treatment for constipation. This includes gradually increasing your daily intake of fibre, making sure you drink plenty of fluids, and trying to get more exercise. If these aren''t effective, your GP may prescribe an oral laxative medication that can help you empty your bowels. Treatment for constipation is effective, although in some cases it can take several months before a regular bowel pattern is re-established. Read more about treating constipation. Preventing constipation Making the diet and lifestyle changes mentioned above can also help to reduce your risk of developing constipation in the first place. Giving yourself enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably may also help, and you should try not to ignore the urge to go to the toilet. Read more about preventing constipation. Complications For most people constipation rarely causes complications, but people with long-term constipation can develop: haemorrhoids (piles) faecal impaction (where dry, hard stools collect in the rectum) bowel incontinence (the leakage of liquid stools) Read more about the complications of constipation.

(77, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/meningitis-B-vaccine.aspx', 'Men B vaccine', 'Men B vaccine - Vaccinations - NHS CHoices', '', 'The Men B vaccine is recommended for babies aged 8 weeks, 16 weeks and one year as part of the NHS routine childhood vaccination programme. The Men B vaccine will protect your baby against infection by meningococcal group B bacteria, which are responsible for more than 90% of meningococcal infections in young children. Meningococcal infections can be very serious, causing meningitis and septicaemia (blood poisoning), which can lead to severe brain damage, amputations and, in some cases, death. The Men B vaccine used is called Bexsero.  England was the first country in the world to offer a national, routine and publicly funded Men B vaccination programme using the Bexsero vaccine. When should babies should have the Men B vaccine? The Men B vaccine is offered to babies alongside their other routine vaccinations at: 8 weeks 16 weeks One year  How is the Men B vaccine given? The vaccine is given as a single injection into the baby''s thigh. How to get the Men B vaccine Your doctor''s surgery or clinic will automatically send you an appointment for you to bring your baby for their Men B vaccination alongside their other routine vaccinations. Most surgeries and health centres run special immunisation or baby clinics. If you can''t get to the clinic, contact the surgery to make another appointment. Find out when your baby should have the Men B vaccine. Men B vaccine safety Like all vaccines, the Men B vaccine can cause side effects, but studies suggest they are generally mild and don''t last long. Almost 8,000 people, including more than 5,000 babies and toddlers, have had the Men B vaccine during clinical trials to test its safety. Since the vaccine was licensed, almost a million doses have been given, with no safety concerns identified. Read the patient information leaflet for Bexsero. Can the Men B vaccine be given at the same time as other vaccines? The Men B vaccine can be given at the same time as other routine baby vaccinations, such as the 5-in-1 vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine. Can vaccines overload a baby''s immune system? Men B vaccine and fever Babies given the Men B vaccine alongside their other routine vaccinations at 8 and 16 weeks are likely to develop fever within the first 24 hours after vaccination. It''s important that you give your baby liquid paracetamol following vaccination to reduce the risk of fever. Your nurse will give you more information about paracetamol at your vaccination appointment. Other common side effects include irritability and redness and tenderness at the injection site. The liquid paracetamol will also help with these symptoms. Read this NHS leaflet on how to use paracetamol to prevent and treat fever after Men B vaccination. Read more about possible Men B vaccine side effects. Meningitis B is a killer Meningococcal group B bacteria is a serious cause of life-threatening infections, including meningitis and blood poisoning, worldwide and the leading infectious killer of babies and young children in the UK. There are 12 known groups of meningococcal bacteria, and group B (Men B) is responsible for about 90% of meningococcal infections in the UK. Meningitis and septicaemia caused by meningococcal group B bacteria can affect people of any age, but is most common in babies and young children. Meningococcal infections tend to come in bursts. In the past 20 years, between 500 and 1,700 people every year, mainly babies and young children, have suffered from Men B disease, with around 1 in 10 dying from the infection. Many of those who survive suffer terrible permanent disability, such as amputation, brain damage and epilepsy. Read more about meningitis. Men B vaccine protection There are hundreds of different strains of meningococcal group B bacteria around the world, and some tests predict that the Bexsero Men B vaccine protects against almost 90% of the ones circulating in England. However, it''s not yet clear how this will relate to lives saved or cases prevented. How the Men B vaccine works The Men B vaccine is made from three major proteins found on the surface of most meningococcal bacteria, combined with the outer membrane of one Men B strain. Together, these constituents stimulate the immune system to protect against future exposures to meningococcal bacteria. For more detail on the ingredients of the Men B vaccine, read the patient information leaflet for Bexsero. Read more about vaccine ingredients. Different types of meningitis vaccines There are two other vaccines against common strains of meningococcal disease – the Men ACWY vaccine (against meningococcal groups A, C, W and Y) which is offered on the NHS to 14-year-olds and first-time students and the Hib/Men C vaccine (against Haemophilus influenza type B and meningococcal group C) for babies at one year old.

(78, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/choosing-care-services.aspx', NULL, 'Choosing care services - Care and support guide - NHS Choices', '', 'Choosing your care services can be a daunting prospect. There are many care options available, but which kind of support is right for you? Think about what you get most out of in life. You may have particular interests that you want to keep up, or you may simply want to spend time with your family or friends. You may have a job that you want to keep on doing, or a social activity, sport, religion or a political group that you want to keep up with. Your social care support should – as much as possible – help you to continue to do these things, and may help you find new things to do. When choosing the type of care, you also need to think about: location services standards and quality price Location of your care Your own home is often the best place for you to get care services. At home is where you may have family and friends and you’ll be in a familiar and hopefully safe environment. You may want to get help at home, perhaps through having home help come in to help you with daily tasks. To stay independently at home, you may need to have care services in the form of adaptations to your home (to help with mobility, for example) or perhaps just equipment to help you out. However, your home may not always be the best environment if you have care needs. It may not be safe for you, particularly if you do not have a friend or relative around to help (if you live in an isolated rural area, for example). Or you may have particular needs that cannot be easily met in your home. If you do need to move out of your home for care reasons, there is a variety of accommodation options that you may want to consider. These include sheltered housing, extra care housing and residential care homes or nursing homes. If you are thinking about moving, it''s worth considering whether it is best to stay in the area you are in now, which you will be familiar with, or whether you should move elsewhere to be nearer family or friends. You may also want to think about the location from a practical perspective (whether it''s on a bus route, for example) or for more personal reasons (such as whether you like the surroundings). The kinds of care services on offer If you are choosing a care service – particularly if it''s an ongoing service such as home care or a place in a care home, you should think about the particular things you want from the service (this will often be referred to as your "outcomes"). Use the services search to find out about the location, services, facilities, staff and performance of a Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered care home or homecare provider. Your search results should tell you whether a service can support you if you have particular needs, such as a sensory impairment or a learning disability. If the service is not registered with the CQC, you may have to ask them directly for information about the services, and you may want to get independent verification, if any is available. Your local authority may have a list of local support providers, with information on each. Standards and quality of care Everyone has a right to expect certain standards in their care. Your care services should help keep you safe and well, but also treat you with dignity and respect. You should always be able to express a choice in your care. The standards for social care providers, such as care homes, are set out by the CQC. The CQC''s inspection reports will tell you which services are meeting the minimum requirements. If you do not think the service is meeting these requirements, you may want to make a complaint. Good quality services, in whatever form they take, will treat you as an individual and attend to your personal needs. If you have homecare, for instance, the care workers who come into your home should listen to your wishes and include you and your family in decisions and care. When choosing care, you might want to look out for services that are signed up to the social care commitment. Check how well your local authority social services are performing. The price of your care When choosing social care services, you will have to consider how much the services may cost. The cost of your care may reflect each of the aspects listed above: location, quality and the kinds of services offered. If you have had an assessment from your local authority, you may get services for free. However, many people have to pay for their own care services (self-funders), and even people who have care funded by the local authority will need to know about the costs of care if they are using a personal budget or a direct payment. To find out more, read How can I fund my care?  More information The Money Advice Service has more information on choosing the right sort of care services.

(79, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-acwy-vaccine.aspx', 'Men ACWY vaccine', 'Men ACWY vaccine', '', 'Young teenagers and ''fresher'' students going to university for the first time are advised to have a vaccination to prevent meningitis W disease. The Men ACWY vaccine is given by a single injection into the upper arm and protects against four different causes of meningitis and septicaemia – meningococcal (Men) A, C, W and Y diseases. There are two Men ACWY vaccines called Nimenrix and Menveo. They are very similar and both work equally well. Read the patient information leaflet for Nimenrix. Read the patient information leaflet for Menveo. At what age should teenagers and young people have the vaccine? The Men ACWY vaccination programme is being delivered to teenagers and first-time students in a carefully planned programme over the next three years. The priority is to vaccinate all teenagers from school year 9 onwards before they complete school year 13. There is also a catch-up vaccination programme for first-time students up to the age of 25. Schoolchildren: Children aged 14 (school year 9) will be offered the Men ACWY vaccine in school as part of the routine adolescent schools programme alongside the 3-in-1 teenage booster, and as a direct replacement for the Men C vaccination. University students: Students going to university or college for the first time, including overseas and mature students up to the age of 25, should contact their GP to have the Men ACWY vaccine, ideally before the start of or in the first few weeks of the academic year. Why teenagers and students should have the Men ACWY vaccination Cases of meningitis and septicaemia (blood poisoning) caused by Men W bacteria are rising, due to a particularly deadly strain. Older teenagers and university students are at high risk of infection because many of them mix closely with lots of new people, some of whom may unknowingly carry the meningococcal bacteria. The highest risk of meningitis is in the first year of university, particularly the first few months. As the Men ACWY vaccine is being targeted at those at highest risk, students in their second year or above of university are not included in this vaccination programme. The dangers of Men W disease Cases of meningitis and septicaemia due to Men W have been increasing in England, from 22 cases in 2009 to 117 in 2014. The increase seems to be speeding up in 2015, caused by an aggressive strain of the bug. With early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, most people with meningococcal disease make a full recovery. But it''s fatal in about 1 in 10 cases and can lead to long-term health problems, such as amputation, deafness, epilepsy and learning difficulties. Men W infections are particularly severe and usually need to be treated in intensive care. They have a higher death rate than the more common Men C and Men B strains. The Men ACWY vaccine has previously been recommended only for people at increased risk of meningococcal disease, including people with no spleen or a spleen that doesn’t work properly, for Hajj pilgrims, and for travellers to countries with high rates of meningococcal disease, including parts of Africa and Latin America. More about Men ACWY as a travel vaccine. Men ACWY vaccine effectiveness The Men ACWY vaccine provides good protection against serious infections caused by four different meningococcal groups (A, C, W and Y) including meningitis and septicaemia. The vaccine only contains the sugar coating on the surface of the four groups of meningococcal bacteria and works by triggering the body’s immune system to develop antibodies against the sugar coating without causing disease. Read more about vaccine ingredients. Men ACWY vaccine side effects Like all vaccines, the Men ACWY vaccine can cause side effects, but studies suggest they are generally mild and soon settle. The most common side effects seen in teenagers and young people who receive the vaccine are redness, hardening and itching at the injection site, fever, headache, nausea and fatigue. Who should not have the Men ACWY vaccine? You should not have the Men ACWY vaccine if you are allergic to the vaccine or any of its ingredients. You can find out the vaccine ingredients in the patient information leaflets for Nimenrix and Menveo. You should also check with the doctor or nurse before having the Men ACWY vaccine if you: have a bleeding problem, such as haemophilia, or bruise easily have a high temperature are pregnant or breastfeeding How is meningitis W spread? Meningococcal disease is caused by a bacterium called Neisseria meningitidis (also called the meningococcus). These bacteria can be divided into 13 different groups, of which five (A, B, C, W and Y) are responsible for nearly all serious meningococcal infections. The meningococcal bacteria live in the back of the nose and throat in about 1 in 10 of the population without causing any illness. The bacteria is spread from person to person by close prolonged contact with a person carrying the bacteria, such as coughing, kissing and sneezing. Very occasionally, the meningococcal bacteria can cause serious illness, including meningitis and septicaemia. Meningococcal infections can strike at any age, but babies, young children and teenagers are especially vulnerable. Read more about how meningitis bugs are spread. Men W cases on the increase In England, most meningococcal infections are caused by group B (Men B). Men C, Men W and Men Y are usually responsible for only 10-20% of cases. Although the total number of meningococcal cases in England has been falling since the early 2000s, Men W infections have increased from only 22 cases in 2009 to 117 in 2014. Currently, Men W alone accounts for almost a quarter of all meningococcal infections in England. From 2009 to 2012, an average of four people died of meningitis W each year. Most of the people who died were elderly. But during 2013 and 2014, there were 24 deaths from Men W disease including, for the first time in over a decade, babies and toddlers. Read more about meningitis and septicaemia. Babies, older people and Men W vaccine Only teenagers and young people will be vaccinated against Men W as part of the new vaccination programme. This is so they will be directly protected by the Men ACWY vaccine at a time when they''re at increased risk (entering colleges and universities, where they will be socialising more). Vaccinating teenagers against Men W should have the added benefit of indirectly protecting other age groups, including unvaccinated babies, children and older people. This is because teenagers are the age group most likely to carry the meningococcal bacteria at the back of their noses. Vaccinating teenagers will reduce the number of carriers, and therefore spread of the Men W bug, both within their social circles and also to other age groups. How to spot meningitis and septicaemia Men W disease, like all meningococcal infections, can come on suddenly and progress quickly. All meningococcal infections can cause meningitis and septicaemia, but Men W can also cause other illnesses, such as pneumonia and joint infections (septic arthritis). Early symptoms of meningococcal disease include: headache vomiting muscle pain fever cold hands and feet A rash of tiny red pinpricks may also develop once septicaemia has set in. You can tell this is a meningitis rash if it doesn’t fade under pressure – for instance, when gently pressing a glass against it (the "glass test"). If you, or a child or adult you know, has these symptoms, seek urgent medical advice. Don’t wait for a rash to develop. Early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics are vital. Here’s more info on the symptoms of meningitis and the treatment of meningitis. Other meningitis vaccines The Hib/Men C vaccine is offered as part of the NHS vaccination programme to all babies aged 12 months old. The Men B vaccine (Bexsero) is offered as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme, to all babies aged 2, 4 and 12 months old.

It may be triggered by bad posture while sitting or standing, bending awkwardly, or lifting incorrectly. It''s not generally caused by a serious condition. Find out more about the causes of back pain. In most cases back pain will improve in a few weeks or months, although some people experience long-term pain or pain that keeps coming back. Types of back pain Backache is most common in the lower back (lumbago), although it can be felt anywhere along your spine, from your neck down to your hips. Read information on neck pain and shoulder pain, which are covered separately. Sometimes back pain can be caused by an injury or disease, such as: a slipped disc – when one of the discs in the spine is damaged and presses on the nerves sciatica – irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve, which causes pain, numbness and tingling that travels down one leg whiplash – neck injury caused by a sudden impact frozen shoulder – inflammation around the shoulder that causes pain and stiffness ankylosing spondylitis – a long-term condition that causes pain and stiffness where the spine meets the pelvis The rest of this information will focus on back pain that doesn''t have an obvious cause. Doctors call this non-specific back pain. What to do Most cases of back pain get better on their own and you may not need to see a doctor. If you''ve only had back pain for a few days or weeks, the following advice may help relieve your symptoms and speed up your recovery: remain as active as possible and try to continue with your daily activities take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen if you feel you need to use hot or cold compression packs – you can buy these from your local pharmacy, or a bag of frozen vegetables and a hot water bottle will work just as well Although it can be difficult to be cheerful or optimistic if you are in pain, it''s important to stay positive as this can help you recover faster. Read more about treatments for short-term back pain. Treatments for long-term back pain If you''re worried about your back or your pain hasn''t improved by around six weeks, it''s a good idea to visit your GP, who can advise you about the treatments available. These include: stronger painkillers exercise classes – where you are taught specific exercises to strengthen your muscles and improve your posture manual therapy – such as physiotherapy, chiropractic or osteopathy acupuncture counselling – such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) support and advice at a specialist pain clinic Some people choose to see a therapist for manual therapy or acupuncture without seeing their GP first. If you want to do this, you will usually need to pay for private treatment, which is likely to cost around £30-50 for each appointment. Spinal surgery is usually only recommended when all else has failed. Read more about treating long-term back pain. Preventing back pain How you sit, stand, lie and lift can all affect the health of your back. Try to avoid placing too much pressure on your back and ensure it''s strong and supple. Regular exercise, such as walking and swimming, is an excellent way of preventing back pain. Activities such as yoga or pilates can improve your flexibility and strengthen your back muscles. See the back pain guide for advice about how to sit, stand and lift correctly to avoid backache, or read more about preventing back pain. Signs of a serious problem You should seek urgent medical help if you have back pain and: a high temperature (fever) unexplained weight loss a swelling or a deformity in your back it''s constant and doesn''t ease after lying down pain in your chest loss of bladder or bowel control an inability to pass urine numbness around your genitals, buttocks or back passage it''s worse at night it started after an accident, such as after a car accident These problems could be a sign of something more serious and need to be assessed as soon as possible.

Your local authority may be able to help you better understand your housing needs.  As local authorities now have a duty to assess anyone who appears to have care and support needs under the Care Act 2014, your local authority should: assess your needs and give you advice, whatever your financial circumstances provide information about services and support options available to you in your area give you a carer’s assessment if you are an unpaid/family carer The assessment by the local authority is important because it will help you work out what your difficulties are and consider what support options, including your housing arrangement, you might have.  Below is a range of housing options that you might want to consider. These include moving to a more appropriate setting or residence or making adaptations to your current home. All may be appropriate whether you own your own home or rent from a private or social landlord. It is important that you take account of any financial implications and consequences for you. If you prefer, you can go straight to housing options for younger adults with a disability.  Housing options for older people You or the person you are looking after may be finding it difficult to manage in your own home or would prefer to move somewhere else. You may want to live somewhere smaller and easier to maintain, or you may want to live somewhere more suited to your physical needs, such as a bungalow. You may prefer to live nearer family or friends, or have easier access to facilities such as transport and leisure. You may want to live in a community where you retain your independence but where care and support are available on site if you need them or if you might require them in future. While buying or renting a different property, or moving into a care home might be the first options that spring to mind, there are many others you could consider when making a decision to move that might suit you better now and for the future. Some examples are listed below. Exchanging council or housing association property Sheltered housing Homeshare Extra care housing Close care Retirement villages If you are having problems with your current home, Housing Options for Older People is an online tool you can use to help you identify the most important difficulties and offers suggestions for dealing with them. EAC First Stop Advice Call for free: 0800 377 7070 Email: info@firststopadvice.org.uk Website: www.firststopadvice.org.uk EAC FirstStop Advice is an independent, free telephone service offering advice and information to older people, their families and carers about housing and care options for later life.  Exchanging council or housing association property Your council or housing association may be able to help you find more suitable accommodation by arranging an exchange or “swap” for other council or housing association property. You may want to consider factors such as the new location, accessibility and the cost of renting the exchanged housing. Ask the relevant local authority or housing association for details of any schemes in your area. Sheltered housing Sheltered housing is designed for people who are normally able to live quite independently, but need occasional help or support from time to time. Often sheltered housing will have a warden who can be called in an emergency, and other security features such as emergency alarm systems. Sheltered housing properties may also have communal facilities such as a laundry, lounge and garden, as well as offering social activities and events. The level of support on offer will vary depending on the individual scheme. Sheltered housing may be provided by a local authority or can be bought or rented privately. It’s important to check whether there are service charges and if so, how large they are, and also whether there are any rules that could impact on you, such as rules around keeping pets for example. Homeshare A homeshare scheme is where someone who needs a small amount of help to live independently in their own home is matched with someone who needs somewhere to live and can provide support or companionship. Homeshare schemes arrange the matching process between someone who typically lives at home but has developed some support needs or has become isolated or anxious about living alone, with the ‘homesharer’; someone who is in need of housing and can provide a level of practical support to the other person. This is different from shared lives schemes, where the person who needs support will usually move into another person’s home. Usually no rent is charged, but the household bills are shared, and in return the homesharer will help out around the house, for example by cooking meals, running errands, shopping trips and providing company. Find out more and see if there’s a homeshare scheme near you at SharedLivesPlus. Extra care housing Extra care housing (which could also be called “assisted living” or “very sheltered housing”) offers a greater level of support than sheltered accommodation. Residents of extra care housing live in self-contained flats, but may have services provided to them by on-site staff, such as meals or personal care and domestic support and there are likely to be communal areas for those who wish to use them. You do not have to sign-up to receive care and support when you first move in and the level of assistance can be increased as your needs change. Most extra care housing schemes also have communal areas such as lounges and cafes. Extra care is largely provided to rent or buy, but it may be an option to discuss with your local authority if you meet the eligibility criteria. For more information about how extra care housing is designed, managed, and funded – including case studies on some of the latest and best schemes on the Housing LIN website.  Close care “Close care” is a term used to describe housing for older people that is near or adjacent to a care home. The care home provides personal care services to the residents and often allows for a future move to the care home if needed. This form of housing can sometimes be a good option for couples who have different needs. Retirement villages Retirement villages can consist of a large-scale development of bungalows, flats or houses designed for the needs of older people. Many of these retirement complexes will include a care home and a number of communal facilities. Housing options for younger adults with a disability Teenagers and young adults with special needs or disabilities may want – or need – greater independence as they get older. But they are also likely to have care needs which mean they need alternative housing options. Those care needs may be related to, for example, physical or mental health problems, a learning disability, or drug or alcohol misuse. There are a variety of housing options they may want to consider: Buying or renting an adapted property Sheltered housing schemes for younger people Supported housing in the community Supported living services Shared lives schemes Buying or renting an adapted property If they have physical health problems, for example, the local authority could help to find a property which has already been adapted in a way that meets their needs. Alternatively, they may be able to get a housing grant to cover any adaptations which need to be made. Sheltered housing schemes for younger people Although many sheltered housing schemes are specifically for older people, there are some that cater to the needs of younger disabled adults. These homes are designed for independent living but have extra facilities such as a warden who can be called in an emergency, or communal facilities such as a laundry and lounge. Supported housing in the community Some young adults will only require a small amount of support when at home, and may go to college, work or day centres during the day. A wide variety of housing options is available for these more independent adults. Some supported housing is managed by the local authority, and some by housing associations, voluntary organisations and charities which run the units to meet particular needs, such as adults with learning disabilities. Supported living services Supported living services aim to keep people in the community with as much independence as possible but with appropriate support. They may include providing suitable or adapted accommodation – which can be your own home – and some forms of personal care. This kind of support may benefit someone who wants to continue living where they are or who is moving elsewhere, such as to a hostel or shared accommodation of some type. Services that support independent living may include help to access training and employment, help with claiming benefits or social skills. They could also include life skills such as healthy eating and budgeting. Supported living services don’t usually include personal and health care, such as help with washing and taking medication, so these need to be arranged separately as part of the care plan. To find out if someone is eligible for supported living, they will need to be assessed by their local authority. Shared lives schemes Shared lives – sometimes known as “adult placement” – matches adults with care and support needs with people who act as a carer to give them help and support. In many cases the adult will live with someone who acts as their carer in the carers own home. This could be a long-term placement or a short stay, such as following a period in hospital. In some cases, the carer will support someone who continues to live in their own home, but the carer will act as a family member, providing a consistent relationship and emotional support. Find out more about shared lives schemes. Making adaptations to your current home Minor adaptations costing less than £1,000 are provided by local authorities at no charge, if you are assessed as needing them. Minor adaptations include: grab rails to make it safer to get in and out of a bath blocks to make beds higher raised toilet seats and bath seats In some cases you may be asked to pay costs associated with these changes, such as maintenance charges. If you disagree with the decision about a minor adaptation, use the local authority’s complaints procedure. If the adaptation costs more than £1,000, you may be eligible for a disabled facilities grant to help pay for it. This could include bigger changes, such as: widening doors and installing ramps improving access to rooms and facilities, such as stair lifts or a downstairs bathroom providing a heating system suitable for your needs adapting heating or lighting controls to make them easier to use A disabled facilities grant will not affect any benefits that you’re getting. Find out more on GOV.UK: disabled facilities grants. Landlords duty to make “reasonable adjustments” Under the Equality Act 2010, there is a duty for landlords to make “reasonable adjustments” for tenants with disabilities. Your landlord doesn’t have to make changes which affect the structure or which would substantially and permanently alter the building. For example, they don’t have to remove walls, widen doorways or install permanent ramps. But there are some things they must do to adapt your home if you’re disabled and if it’s reasonable to do so. For example, you can ask your landlord to do the following things under the Equality Act:   remove, replace or provide any furniture, furnishings, materials or equipment, as long as it would not become a permanent fixture when installed replace or provide signs or notices replace taps or door handles replace, provide or adapt your door bell or door entry system change the colour of any surface – for example, a wall or a door changing practices, policies and procedures – for example, allowing an assistance dog in a place that normally doesn’t allow pets To find out more, see the Citizen’s Advice Bureau guide on discrimination in housing.

The best way to get help from your local authority is to ask for a care and support needs assessment. You can do this by contacting the local authority adult social services department. When you get assessed by the local authority, as a minimum you may be given information and signposting to other services, and ways that you might find funding to pay for them. However, if your needs meet the national eligibility criteria, your local authority will have to meet these needs.  The local authority will involve you throughout the assessment to identify what your needs are and how these impact on your wellbeing. They will also discuss with you how you wish to live your life and whether there are certain aims you would like to achieve but you are unable to do so because of your care and support needs. The assessment will start to consider how your care needs might be met. This could include identifying how preventative services like simple aids (such as devices to open jars and tins more easily), adaptations to your home (such as handrails) or information about support available in the community might meet your need.  It will also identify if you have a higher level of need where you may need help in your own home or care in a care home. The assessment should be carried out in a way that ensures your involvement and that takes the right amount of time to capture all of your needs. If you have a friend or family member looking after you as an unpaid carer, they can have a carer’s assessment to see if they need support to carry on their caring role. The local authority must give you a copy of your needs assessment or carer’s assessment. What are the national eligibility criteria for care and support? The eligibility threshold for adults with care and support needs is based on identifying how a person’s needs affect their ability to achieve relevant outcomes, and how this impacts on their wellbeing. Local authorities must consider whether the person’s needs:  arise from or are related to a physical or mental impairment or illness make them unable to achieve two or more specified outcomes as a result of being unable to meet these outcomes, there is likely to be a significant impact on the adult’s wellbeing An adult’s needs are only eligible where they meet all three of these conditions. The specified outcomes measured include: managing and maintaining nutrition, such as being able to prepare and eat food and drink maintaining personal hygiene, such as being able to wash themselves and their clothes managing toilet needs being able to dress appropriately, for example during cold weather being able to move around the home safely, including accessing the home from outside keeping the home sufficiently clean and safe being able to develop and maintain family or other personal relationships, in order to avoid loneliness or isolation accessing and engaging in work, training, education or volunteering, including physical access being able to safely use necessary facilities or services in the local community including public transport and recreational facilities or services carrying out any caring responsibilities, such as for a child Local authorities do not have responsibility for providing NHS services such as patient transport, but they should consider needs for support when the adult is attending healthcare appointments. Local authorities'' duty to carry out a needs assessment Local authorities have a duty to assess a person who appears to need care and support. They may need care and support because of serious illness, physical disability, learning disability, mental health problems or frailty because of old age. The local authority is obliged to carry out a needs assessment when they become aware that someone may be in need of care and support. This may mean that an assessment is offered even if it has not been specifically requested. Alternatively, you can contact your local social services department and ask them to arrange a needs assessment. Normally, an assessment is carried out before a service can be provided by the social services department of a local authority. If you need care urgently, the local authority may be able to meet these needs without carrying out the assessment. Local authorities'' duty to carry out a carer’s assessment Local authorities have a duty to carry out a carer’s assessment where a carer appears to need support. The carer’s assessment will consider the carer’s need for support and whether they can continue to care without help. The assessment can be offered even if the carer has not asked for one. Needs assessments and local authority funding Once a local authority has established that a person has needs that meet the national eligibility criteria, it has to make sure that these needs are met. The first step will be to draw up a care and support plan, or in the case of a carer with eligible needs, a support plan. If you have eligible needs, the local authority will check that you normally live in their area. Social care is not free and you may have to contribute towards the cost of meeting your needs. Local authorities will do an assessment to see if you have to contribute and how much that would be. The local authority should not refuse to meet eligible needs on the grounds of cost, although if there is more than one option, it is allowed to choose what it believes is the most cost effective one. If your needs do not meet the national eligibility criteria, the local authority still has to give you information and advice on what support might be available in the community to support you. Alternatively, you may want to consider funding your own care and support to help with the needs identified as a result of the assessment. If you disagree with your needs assessment or the care and support plan, there are ways that decisions can be challenged or you can make a complaint.

(85, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/flu-jab-vaccine-pregnant.aspx', 'Flu jab for pregnant women', 'Flu jab pregnancy', '', 'It''s recommended that all pregnant women have the flu vaccine, whatever stage of pregnancy they''re at. Why should pregnant women have the flu vaccine? Is the flu vaccine safe in pregnancy? When should I have it? How do I get the flu vaccine? If I had the flu jab last year, do I have to have it again now? Will the flu jab give me flu? Can I have the flu jab at the same time as the whooping cough vaccine?  I''m pregnant and think I have flu. What should I do?     Why are pregnant women advised to have the flu vaccine? The flu jab will protect both you and your baby. There is good evidence that pregnant women have a higher chance of developing complications if they get flu, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy. One of the most common complications of flu is bronchitis, a chest infection that can become serious and develop into pneumonia. Other complications are not common, but include: otitis media (middle ear infection) septic shock (blood infection that causes a severe drop in blood pressure) meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord) encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) If you have flu while you''re pregnant, it could mean your baby is born prematurely or has a low birthweight, and may even lead to stillbirth or death in the first week of life. Is the flu vaccine safe in pregnancy? Yes. Studies have shown that the flu vaccine is safe during any stage of pregnancy, from the first few weeks up to your expected due date. The vaccine doesn''t carry risks for either you or your baby. Women who have had the flu vaccine while pregnant also pass some protection on to their babies, which lasts for the first few months of their lives. The vaccine also poses no risk to women who are breastfeeding, or to their babies. When should I have the flu jab? The flu vaccine is normally available from September until around January or February each year. It is free for pregnant women. If you''re eligible for the vaccine, try to have it as soon as possible so that you''ll be protected by the time the flu viruses are circulating in the winter. Don''t worry if you find that you''re pregnant later on in the flu season, though, you can have the vaccine then if you haven''t already had it. How do I get the flu vaccine? Contact your midwife or GP to find out where you can get the flu vaccine. It''s a good idea to get vaccinated as soon as possible after the vaccine becomes available in September. In some areas, midwives can give a flu vaccine at the antenatal clinic, while in others you will need an appointment at your GP practice. Some community pharmacies now offer flu vaccination on the NHS. If I had the flu jab last year, do I need to have it again now? Yes, because the viruses that cause flu change every year. This means that the flu (and the vaccine) this year may be different from last year. If you had the flu vaccine last year, either because you were pregnant or because you''re in a vulnerable group, you need to have it again this year. Read more about how the flu vaccine works. Will the flu jab give me flu? No. The vaccine doesn''t contain any live viruses, so it can''t cause flu. Some people get a slight temperature and aching muscles for a couple of days afterwards, and you may feel a bit sore at the injection site. Read more about flu vaccine side effects. Can I have the flu jab at the same time as the whooping cough vaccine? Yes, you can have the flu jab at the same time as the whooping cough vaccine, but don''t delay your flu jab simply so you can have both at the same time. Pregnant women are at risk of severe illness from flu at any stage of pregnancy, so really need to have the flu vaccine as soon as possible. The best time to get vaccinated against whooping cough is from 20 weeks, after you''ve had your scan, up to 32 weeks of pregnancy.  If for any reason you miss having the vaccine you can still have it up until you go into labour. Find out more about the whooping cough vaccine in pregnancy. I''m pregnant and think I have flu. What should I do? Talk to your doctor as soon as possible. If you do have flu, there''s a prescribed medicine you can take that might help, or reduce your risk of complications, but it needs to be taken very soon after symptoms appear. You can read more about flu, pregnancy and the vaccine in the leaflet Flu, your pregnancy and you (PDF, 381kb).

You may need to return to work to earn money. For some carers who haven''t worked for some time, this can be daunting. You may have lost your confidence, or feel you no longer have the skills you once had or the skills you need to re-start your career. The kind of support that’s available to help you ease back into the workplace includes: training, guidance and work placement programmes work experience, volunteering and job trials help with starting your own business help with child care or caring responsibilities If you are a carer and want to return to work, you may be able to get help from Jobcentre Plus. The Work Preparation Support for Carers scheme offers advice and training. You may also be able to get replacement care paid for while you are taking part in approved activities. For more information, contact your local Jobcentre Plus office or call the Jobcentre Plus phone service on 0845 6060 234 (Textphone: 0845 6055 255), Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm). Your working pattern You may not want to have a full-time job or you may prefer to work for yourself rather than for someone else but if you are already in employment or are looking for a job you should consider what type of working arrangement would work best for you and your employer/prospective employer. Options you can consider include: full-time work requesting a flexible working pattern (including part-time work, flexi-time, working compressed hours, and job-sharing) voluntary work Find out more about the employment rights of carers and the options available to you. Financial support and career loans when you go back to work If you''re ready to look for a job there are benefits, such as Jobseeker''s Allowance, to help you. Jobseeker''s Allowance includes a payment that helps with any mortgage interest you have to pay. You may also be paid Housing Benefit to help you pay rent. Alternatively you may be able to get a mortgage interest run-on. You may get this if certain other benefits are stopping because you are returning to work. If you qualify you will be paid mortgage interest run on for the first four weeks you are in full-time work. Universal Credit Universal Credit is a new benefit designed to give financial assistance to people who want to work. Universal Credit provides support for housing costs, children, childcare costs, disabled people and carers. It is replacing: income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance income-related Employment Support Allowance Income Support Child Tax Credit Working Tax Credit Housing Benefit Universal Credit will be available for claimants who are in work and on low incomes, as well as for those who are out of work. This means that there is ongoing support if you''re moving in and out of work (Universal Credit support doesn''t suddenly stop during the critical period when you start a new job or increase your part-time hours). Other financial support You may also be eligible for a Professional and Career Development Loan. This is a bank loan of between £300 and £10,000 to fund the cost of learning that enhances your job skills or career prospects. If you’re 19 or over, on a further education course and facing financial hardship, you could apply for Discretionary Learner Support. This can help to pay for things such as accommodation and transport, course materials, equipment and even childcare. You may no longer be eligible for Carer’s Allowance or Income Support if the person you look after goes into a residential or nursing home. You must inform the Carer’s Allowance Unit or Jobcentre Plus about any change in your circumstances or those of the person you care for. Schemes to help you back into work or support you in work Schemes to help people on benefits back into work include: Work Trial  Employment on Trial  Access to Work (support in work) Work Choice  Work Trial Work Trial is a programme that gives unemployed people the chance to try out a real job vacancy for up to 30 working days. This includes carers who may be considering returning to work. It is a voluntary scheme that aims to show a potential employer you are right for the job they are seeking to fill. A Work Trial offers you the chance to: try out a job and show the employer that you are the right person for the job continue receiving benefits during the trial period have your travel expenses to and from work paid for plus a £3 a day meal allowance Your benefits will not be affected if you: decide to leave the Work Trial before the trial period ends turn down the job if it is offered to you at the end of the trial period If the job is offered to you and you agree to accept it Jobcentre Plus will inform you about the type of in-work benefits and tax credits you may be able to claim while working. Arranging your own Work Trial Ask at your local Jobcentre Plus office if you would like to arrange your own Work Trial. They will usually give you a copy of the letter “Work Trials: try it for yourself”, which you can send to the employer along with your application form and job application or CV. Either the employer or your Jobcentre Plus office will then contact you. Alternatively, if you are at a job interview and the employer expresses doubts about your ability to do the job, then you can show them a copy of the letter “Work Trials: try it for yourself” to let them know that you qualify for a trial. Mention that the letter tells them who to contact if they are interested. Employment on Trial Employment on Trial allows you to leave a job and start claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance again without this affecting your benefit (unless you’re sacked or leave because of misconduct). You must have worked more than 16 hours a week for between four and 12 weeks before leaving the job. Access to Work An Access to Work grant can pay for practical support if you have a disability, health or mental health condition to help you: start working stay in work move into self-employment or start a business The grant is not for business start-up costs. How much you get depends on your circumstances. The money doesn’t have to be paid back and will not affect your other benefits. Work Choice If you are a disabled carer thinking about returning to paid work after a long period out of the workplace, the Jobcentre Plus Work Choice programme may provide the support you need. It’s designed to help disabled people whose needs can’t be met through other programmes such as Access to Work. The support you get through Work Choice can be tailored to meet your needs, and consists of: Work entry support: includes help with personal skills and finding work and can last up to six months. You can be helped to get supported or unsupported work.  In-work support: which can give you help with starting work and staying in your job. This support can last up to two years.  Longer term in-work support: which can help you to progress in your job. If appropriate, you may be helped to move into unsupported work. If you’d like to find out more about Work Choice, contact your local Jobcentre Plus. Getting your career back on track You may want to return to work once your caring role ends. If you have given up work to become a full-time carer or have not been able to take up paid employment before because of your caring responsibilities, you may want to get your career back on track. Identifying your skills You may be unsure of what you want to do, or even what it is that you are capable of doing. It may help to first identify the skills you have. Think of what you have learned from being a carer. As well as paid work, this may include the tasks and responsibilities involved in being a carer such as organising and arranging care support. Think about any voluntary and community work you may have been involved in and identify any transferable skills you have built up during any job or activity (that you can apply to other jobs). Jobcentre Plus and the National Careers Service can give you more advice on identifying transferable skills. If you feel you no longer have the skills you once had, or you’d like to brush up on them, you may be entitled to fully funded vocational skills training including National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), employability, English, maths and ICT. If you are receiving benefits your Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will be able to offer advice, or you can approach your local college directly about accessing training. National Careers Service The National Careers Service offers careers and skills advice for people looking for work, including carers. Ways the National Careers Service can help include: advice on drawing up and perfecting your CV the ability to search for courses and training in your area help with finding funding for different courses advice on work experience, apprenticeships and looking for work online To find the job or career that is right for you, it is often worth spending time thinking about the kind of job you want to do and what motivates you. You can draw up a list of your hobbies, interests and experience inside and outside of your work history, such as: qualifications and courses jobs you have had – both paid and unpaid achievements in these jobs, especially if you can use examples to show what you did, such as awards, sales targets met, increases in efficiency or profit interests and hobbies transferable skills you gained as a carer, such as problem solving and the ability to be flexible If you’re not sure what kind of work might suit you, you could try out the National Careers Service Skills Health Check. This is a set of online questionnaires that produce an end report giving you information about your skills, interests and motivations in the workplace. The tools help you to think about the kinds of jobs that might be best for you in future. You can contact the National Careers Service on 0800 100 900 (free to call from a landline, mobile charges vary), Monday to Sunday, 8am to 10pm. You can also arrange for a National Careers Service adviser to call you. This won’t cost you anything. Volunteering Many carers’ caring responsibilities can prevent them from taking up work, or force them into giving up work in the short or long term. For carers who may have been out of the workforce for some time, a good way of reintroducing yourself to work, when and if that time arises, is through voluntary work. Volunteering can provide a carer with an interest not connected to their role as a carer. Many people find volunteering builds their confidence and confirms for them that they do already have good work skills, as well as giving them something to talk about in a job interview. You are allowed to work as a volunteer without your benefits being affected, as long as the work you do is unpaid and you meet the rules of your benefit. You will be considered as being a volunteer, for benefits and tax credits purposes, if you: do not receive any money for the work you do (this does not include expenses) are not legally obliged to volunteer volunteer for a not-for-profit organisation volunteer for someone who is not a family member However, you will not be considered as a volunteer if it''s your choice not to be paid for work that you otherwise would be. Speak to your Work Coach or Jobcentre Plus office about the work you are allowed to do that won’t affect your entitlement to benefits.

(87, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/shingles-vaccination.aspx', 'Shingles vaccine', 'Shingles vaccination - Vaccinations - NHS Choices', '', 'A vaccine to prevent shingles, a common, painful skin disease is available on the NHS to certain people in their 70s. The shingles vaccine is given as a single injection into the upper arm. Unlike the flu jab, you''ll only need to have the vaccination once and you can have it at any time of the year. The shingles vaccine is expected to reduce your risk of getting shingles. If you are unlucky enough to go on to have the disease, your symptoms may be milder and the illness shorter. Shingles can be very painful and uncomfortable. Some people are left with pain lasting for years after the initial rash has healed. And shingles is fatal for around 1 in 1,000 over-70s who develop it. It''s fine to have the shingles vaccine if you''ve already had shingles. The shingles vaccine works very well in people who have had shingles before and it will boost your immunity against further shingles attacks. Who can have the shingles vaccination? From September 1 2016 the shingles vaccine is routinely available to people aged 70 and 78. You become eligible for the vaccine on the first day of September 2016 after you''ve turned 70 or 78 and remain so until the last day of August 2017. In addition, anyone who was eligible for immunisation in the previous three years of the programme but missed out on their shingles vaccination remains eligible until their 80th birthday. This includes: people aged 71, 72 and 73 on 1 September 2016 people aged 79 on 1 September 2016  The shingles vaccine is not available on the NHS if you are aged 80 or over. Until 31 August 2016, the shingles vaccine is still available to all those who were aged 70 or 78 on 1 September 2015. You can have the shingles vaccination at any time of year, though many people will find it convenient to have it at the same time as their annual flu vaccination. Find out more about who is eligible for shingles vaccination. How do I get the shingles vaccine? You don''t need to do anything. Your doctor will invite you to the surgery for the vaccine when you become eligible. If you can''t go to the appointment you''re offered, contact your GP practice to rearrange it. It’s important that you don''t leave it too late to have the vaccination, as your GP may only be able to give it to you before 31 August 2017. What is the brand name of the shingles vaccine? The brand name of the shingles vaccine given in the UK is Zostavax. It can be given at any time of the year. Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for Zostavax. How does the shingles vaccine work? The vaccine contains a weakened chickenpox virus (varicella-zoster virus). It''s similar, but not identical to, the chickenpox vaccine. Very occasionally, people have developed a chickenpox-like illness following shingles vaccination (fewer than 1 in 10,000 individuals). How long will the shingles vaccine protect me for? It''s difficult to be precise, but research suggests the shingles vaccine will protect you for at least five years, probably longer. How safe is the shingles vaccine? There is lots of evidence showing that the shingles vaccine is very safe. It''s already been used in several countries, including the US and Canada, and no safety concerns have been raised. The vaccine also has few side effects. Read more about shingles vaccine side effects. What is shingles? Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a painful skin rash caused by the reactivation of the chickenpox virus (varicella-zoster virus) in people who have previously had chickenpox. It begins with a burning sensation in the skin, followed by a rash of very painful fluid-filled blisters that can then burst and turn into sores before healing. Often an area on just one side of the body is affected, usually the chest but sometimes the head, face and eye. Read more about the symptoms of shingles. How is shingles spread? You don''t "catch" shingles – it comes on when there''s a reawakening of chickenpox virus that''s already in your body. The virus can be reactivated because of advancing age, medication, illness or stress and so on. Anyone who has had chickenpox can get shingles. It''s estimated that around one in five people who have had chickenpox go on to develop shingles. Read more about the causes of shingles. Who''s most at risk of shingles? People tend to get shingles more often as they get older, especially over the age of  70. And the older you are, the worse it can be. The shingles rash can be extremely painful, such that sufferers can''t even bear the feeling of their clothes touching the affected skin. The pain of shingles can also linger long after the rash has disappeared, even for many years. This lingering pain is called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Read more about the complications of shingles. There''s more information about shingles vaccination in this NHS leaflet. Read the answers to some of the common questions about the shingles vaccine.

Causes of type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn''t produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body''s cells don''t react to insulin. This means glucose stays in the blood and isn''t used as fuel for energy. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity and tends to be diagnosed in older people. It''s far more common than type 1 diabetes. Read about the causes and risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Treating type 2 diabetes As type 2 diabetes usually gets worse, you may eventually need medication – usually tablets – to keep your blood glucose at normal levels. Read more about the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Complications of type 2 diabetes Diabetes can cause serious long-term health problems. It''s the most common cause of vision loss and blindness in people of working age. Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year for diabetic retinopathy. Diabetes is also responsible for most cases of kidney failure and lower limb amputation, other than accidents. People with diabetes are up to five times more likely to have cardiovascular disease, such as a stroke, than those without diabetes. Read more about the complications of type 2 diabetes. Preventing type 2 diabetes If you''re at risk of type 2 diabetes, you may be able to prevent it developing by making lifestyle changes. These include: eating a healthy, balanced diet losing weight if you''re overweight, and maintaining a healthy weight stopping smoking if you smoke drinking alcohol in moderation taking plenty of regular exercise Living with type 2 diabetes If you already have type 2 diabetes, it may be possible to control your symptoms by making the above changes. This also minimises your risk of developing complications. Read more about living with type 2 diabetes.

Checking whether the destination is accessible for disabled people, whether it can cater to specific dietary requirements, and planning how you will travel all needs to be done in advance to ensure an enjoyable and stress-free day. Many venues offer a discount for people who are ill or disabled and their carers, so this is also worth checking before you go. Day trips: where to go Events and other ideas for places to go are regularly listed in magazines, local or national newspapers and online sources such as Artsline, which provides information on more than 1,000 arts venues across London that are accessible for disabled people and can cater for individual needs. Books such as The Rough Guide to Accessible Britain can also provide inspiration. The guide is free to Blue Badge holders. It is produced in association with Motability and has listings of days out in Britain for the disabled visitor. English Heritage manages most of the historic castles and monuments in England. You can search for attractions on the English Heritage website by county or postcode and find out what special facilities each location has. The National Trust has many properties and protected land throughout England and Wales. Most of the sites have good access and facilities for disabled people. Where possible, the Trust admits powered wheelchairs and similar small vehicles into its buildings, and frequently provides manual wheelchairs. Self-drive and volunteer-driven powered vehicles are available at some larger gardens and parks. VisitEngland is the website of the official tourist board for England. You can use it to find attractions, shows and events, day trips, accommodation, and destinations across the UK that cater for disabled people. Read about some of the organisations that provide specialist trips for people with disabilities and carers. How accessible is the venue? Once you have decided on where you would like to go, contact the venue directly to enquire about what facilities they have on offer, such as: disabled parking spaces wheelchair access disabled toilet or adult changing facilities accessible restaurant facilities The venue or event you are attending may require you to book in advance or phone ahead to let them know your requirements. Some venues are able to hire out wheelchairs for the day, so it''s worth finding out what they offer beforehand. Some locations may have adult changing facilities, although these are still quite scarce. Use the Changing Places website to find your nearest adult changing facilities. You may also want to buy a key from the National Key Scheme, which offers disabled people independent access to locked public toilets around the country. Carer''s tip from Scope "When you''re out and about, it can be difficult changing pads on older kids and adults. They are too big for change units and the floors are too dirty to lay them on. I take a plastic tablecloth, which is big enough, yet portable and easy to wipe clean." Visit Scope to read more tips Active pursuits for ill or disabled people Being active can be difficult for someone who''s frail, ill or disabled. But keeping active may improve their ability to do daily tasks, help them relax, control their weight, and encourage them to make new friends. Although it can be hard for someone who is ill or disabled to keep active, there are many different options that they could consider. Outdoor sports can be thrilling for anyone. As awareness of disabilities increases and technology advances, more activities are becoming available for disabled people with the help of willing volunteers. These include: fishing – this is a popular sport among disabled people, as it provides a great opportunity to be outdoors in a healthy environment; the British Disabled Angling Association says fishing is a social activity that offers a sense of achievement and possible health benefits horse riding – riding benefits the rider both physically and mentally, and improves balance, posture and co-ordination, and leads to more supple and relaxed muscles; contact Riding for the Disabled Association for more details cycling – the benefits of cycling are the same for disabled people as they are for the able-bodied: it promotes independent mobility, and improves physical and mental wellbeing; if the person you''re looking after has a visual impairment or other disability that prevents them using a single bicycle, you can hire or buy a tandem bike (the charity Charlotte''s Tandems lends tandems free-of-charge to people in this situation) Carer''s tip from Scope "Most places offer queue jumping to people with special needs. If they don''t, I always just go to the front of the queue and ask nicely. No-one ever minds when I do." Visit Scope to read more tips Day centres Day centres help people to get out and about if they don''t have the facilities to do so, or if they live on their own and feel isolated. They offer the chance to learn new skills and participate in activities such as bingo, tea dances, and arts and crafts. Different centres cater for different groups of people, including those with learning disabilities, physical disabilities or mental health problems. Contact your local authority or local carers'' centre to find out about day centres and accessible events in your area. Travel and transport When considering the venue or event you want to visit, you''ll want to think about how easy it will be to travel to and stay at your destination. To plan the best route, you can check public transport details using the Traveline website, or, if you''re travelling by car, the RAC route planner can help you plan your journey. Disabled people can obtain Railcards for use on all trains across the National Rail network. Disabled people travelling in their own wheelchair who don''t hold a Railcard can get discounts on fares for themselves and one travelling companion. People who are registered blind or partially sighted can get the same discounts, but only if they travel with a companion. See the Railcard website for more details. You might also find it useful to check the Changing Places website before you travel to find your nearest disabled toilets with adult changing facilities. Specialist organisations providing accessible holidays The following organisations can provide details of holiday accommodation that''s suitable for people with disabilities and their carers: Tourism for All is a national charity that provides information on accessible holiday venues and places in the UK and abroad for disabled people, their carers and family. Revitalise is a national charity that specialises in short breaks throughout the year for adults and children (aged six and older) with physical disabilities, dementia or sight impairment, and their carers. The charity has holiday centres around the UK, and also offers holidays in Spain and Germany. All Revitalise centres are registered as personal care centres and most are also registered as nursing care centres. However, the charity does not have the resources to provide holidays for people who are bed-dependent, or who have uncontrolled epilepsy, learning difficulties, or mental health problems. The Disaway Trust is a registered charity that organises group holidays internationally and in the UK for people with physical disabilities aged 16 to 80 years and their carers. Holidays for All is an umbrella website for various specialist tour companies and disability charities. Holidays for All has listings for a range of holiday providers who specialise in breaks for people with sensory and physical disabilities, their friends and carers around the UK and abroad.   DisabledGo provides online access information to more than 90,000 venues across the UK and Ireland. MindforYou offers supported holidays for people living with dementia and their carers. Papworth Trust - Kerry Farm a supported holiday for the family Family holiday venues If you''re caring for a child with a disability, short breaks or holidays for the child can benefit both you and the child. You may have other children who do not have a disability, and a short break for the disabled child can allow you quality time with your other children. Organisations such as the Short Breaks Network organise family-based short breaks that can help deal with the sense of isolation that some children with disabilities feel by enabling them to meet new people, make new friends and become part of a "second family". Your social services department, GP or health worker can provide a list of organisations that provide breaks for children with disabilities. They may be able to make a referral to some of the organisations for you. Many parents and carers of children with a disability prefer to take a short break or holiday with the child. One of the organisations listed below may be able to help: The Calvert Trust runs outdoor adventure activities in the countryside. These activities help children and adults with disabilities, along with their families and friends, to fulfil their potential. The trust has three purpose-built centres with full-board or self-catering accommodation around the UK, offering a range of sports and recreational activities. The Holiday Homes Trust provides affordable holidays for families, carers or groups who have a member with a disability, physical, mental, or age-related illness. Their centres are located at popular holiday sites with specially adapted accommodation for all families with a special need, and low-income or single-parent families. You can get advice and information on charitable grants and other financial help with the cost of a holiday from the national charity Contact a Family. The charity has produced a useful guide called Holidays, play and leisure (PDF, 1.03Mb). The Disabled Holiday Directory is an online directory of organisations and venues, both in the UK and abroad, that cater for children and adults with disabilities. More information on activities, breaks and holidays You can get more advice on NHS Choices about help with transport costs, or check out our healthcare abroad sections if you are going abroad. GOV.UK also has specific advice on foreign travel for disabled people. If you are a carer, you may want a holiday or short break without the person you care for.

In England, this age-group is typically in year eight. Health conditions and HPV vaccination Most girls are able to have the vaccine, but there are a few who need to take some precautions. Before the vaccination, tell your GP if your daughter has: a condition that makes them bleed more than normal, such as thrombocytopenia; it may be possible to use a different type of injection  a weakened immune system, as the vaccine may not be as effective If these health conditions affect her, it doesn''t necessarily mean that she cannot have the HPV vaccine, it simply means that extra care should be taken. Other medications and the HPV vaccine Before the vaccination, tell your GP if your daughter is taking, or has recently taken, any other medicines, including: prescription medicines over-the-counter medicines other vaccinations Research shows that taking hormonal contraceptives, such as the Pill, do not appear to reduce the protection the vaccine provides. Which girls should not be vaccinated? As with any medicine or vaccine, the HPV vaccine should not be used in girls who: have had a confirmed anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) to a previous dose of the HPV vaccine or any of its ingredients are pregnant   Which girls should delay vaccination? The HPV vaccination should be postponed if your daughter has: a severe illness with a high temperature (fever) This is because symptoms of the illness may be confused with side effects from the vaccine, and this could result in the wrong diagnosis being made. However, there is no reason to delay vaccination for a mild illness, such as the common cold.  Older girls and the HPV vaccine Girls who missed HPV vaccination first time around, can receive a catch up HPV vaccination on the NHS up to age of 18. Girls who have the HPV vaccination after the age of 15 will need three doses, however, as the response to two doses is not so good in older girls.  Page last reviewed: 24/09/2014 Next review due: 24/09/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Supporting young carers Media last reviewed: 30/10/2015 Next review due: 30/10/2017 Friends and relatives are often the first people we turn to for help with our problems. Talking things through with them can be really helpful. People who find it hard to talk to others often write their thoughts in a diary, poem or letter first. This can help to make sense of their thoughts and how they feel, before getting help. Help from teachers and other school staff Teachers are there to help pupils get the most out of school. They can be a good person for you to speak to about any problems you have. If you''re missing lessons to help look after someone at home, or struggling to get your work in on time, talk to a teacher about what you do at home so that they can understand what is happening and give you more help. As a young carer, you might find school a place where you can forget about your caring responsibilities and feel "normal" for a while. But it can also be a place where you''re under extra pressure or where people don''t understand what your life is like outside school. It can sometimes be hard to juggle all your responsibilities as a young carer with the demands of teachers, friends and homework. Keeping up-to-date with school work You might not want your school to know you''re caring for someone. But if they don''t know about your situation, it will be difficult for teachers to understand if you struggle to keep up in class or don''t do your homework. It''s a good idea to let at least one teacher you feel able to trust know you''re a carer. You might find it difficult to talk about your home life with a teacher, so you could ask someone in your family to write a letter to the school, perhaps to the head of year. Some young carers find it easier to talk about the situation if they keep a diary or a list of all the jobs and tasks they have to do. If you''re having trouble with school or homework, your teachers may offer: extra time for school work when you have to give more help to the the person you care for help for your parents to travel to parents'' evenings if they have trouble leaving the house to talk to you privately about your home life  homework clubs Support at school There are lots of ways your school can help. You could be allowed to use a phone during breaks and lunchtime so you can check on the person you''re looking after. The school could also put you in touch with your local young carers service, or get a young carers worker to talk to you. Some schools run lunchtime groups or homework support groups for young carers. If your school doesn''t do this, you could suggest it to your teachers. Nobody wants to get into trouble at school. If teachers know you''re a carer, they may be more sympathetic to your problems (such as lateness), but it won''t necessarily stop you being disciplined if you break the rules. If you are given detention, you could ask to have it during lunchtime rather than after school because of your caring responsibilities. Missing school You may feel you have to miss school to care for someone. But missing school can affect your whole future. It''s important you get help as quickly as possible so the situation doesn''t go on for a long time. The family doctor (GP), nurse, a social worker or other people whose job is to help the person you look after should be able to organise more support at home to help you concentrate on school or college. Friends and your social life As a young carer, you may miss out on opportunities to play and spend time with your friends and classmates. You may feel isolated from your friends because: you don''t have as much free time as them because you have to spend more time at home you''re often thinking about the person you look after you may be worried they will bully you Being a young carer can make you stand out from other people, or you may find that you don’t get included in certain activities. It''s important to get the help you need so that you have time to do the things you want to do and be with your friends. If possible, put aside some time each day to do something you enjoy. Your local young carers project or carers centre may be able to help. Are you being bullied? Just because you''re not being hit doesn''t mean you''re not being bullied. Bullying can include being deliberately left out of activities or groups, as well as being called names, hit, kicked, punched or threatened. Some bullies spread rumours. Some make fun of you or your relatives. You might be bullied for having the ‘wrong’ clothes, blue eyes or red hair. Young carers are sometimes bullied because the person they care for is ill or disabled, or because they can''t always do the things other young people can. Some people are bullied for no reason. In fact, 44% of children and young people say they''ve been bullied at school. Even adults get bullied. It''s natural to feel sad, angry or scared if you''re being bullied. But remember: there are ways to deal with the problem. Find out more about bullying on NHS Choices or by visiting Bullying UK. Childline Childline is a free and confidential telephone helpline for children on 0800 11 11. You can talk to someone on Childline who may be able to give you advice and get you help. They won’t tell anyone that you have called. Meet other young carers Meeting up with other young carers is a great way to make new friends, have some fun and share some of your worries with people in similar situations to your own. The Children''s Society runs services for young carers in many areas. These can help you have a break from home, and meeting other young carers can help you to relax. Young carers projects may offer evening clubs, weekends away, days out and even holidays as well as friendly advice and information for you and for your family. You may also like to go to your local carers centre. Each centre is different, but many of them provide clubs for young carers or one-to-one sessions. Help from social workers From April 2015 the law is being changed to make it easier for young carers to get help. A social worker from your local authority must visit and see if you need any help, if you or your parents request this. Social workers may be asked to help a young carer’s family if there are problems that the family members are finding hard to sort out on their own. Help from doctors, nurses and other health workers If you have concerns about your own health, or the health of the person you care for, you can speak to a doctor or GP safely and confidentially. School nurses visit schools and are normally happy to speak with you about any of your health concerns or worries. Counsellors work in a variety of places, including schools, hospitals and youth centres. Their job is to listen carefully and give advice – in a private setting. Local mental health nurses work can offer emotional support and advice about mental health conditions. If your parent has a ‘community psychiatric nurse’, you can talk to the nurse about your parent’s illness and how you can help your parent cope. If you''re worried about your own mental health, you can speak to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health service. There are services all over the country, giving support to young people with mental health conditions. Macmillan nurses from the national charity Macmillan Cancer Support can help people who are affected by cancer and young carers. They provide a range of medical and emotional support for people who have cancer, and their families. Other organisations that can help young carers You can also chat with one another on YC Net and get advice and support from other young people. The Citizens Advice Bureau provides comprehensive information on money, benefits and your rights. The National Careers Service has a helpline, webchat and email service about education and careers for 13- to 19-year-olds. Support is also available up to the age of 25 for those who have learning difficulties or disabilities. Getting in touch with Carers Direct For advice and support with caring issues over the phone, you can call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053. If you are deaf, deafblind, hard of hearing or have impaired speech, you can contact the Carers Direct helpline using textphone or minicom number 0300 123 1004.

Supported Living Media last reviewed: 30/09/2015 Next review due: 30/09/2017 You may prefer not to live in residential care, but find it difficult to cope at home. But you may, with help, be able to live independently in the community. If so, you may want to consider "supported living services" – sometimes called "floating support", "visiting support", or "tenancy sustainment".   Services that support independent living are made up of suitable or adapted accommodation – which can be your own home – and some forms of personal care. Some supported living homes may be shared by two or three people with similar conditions, such as a substance misuse problem or a particular disability. Staff will usually visit the home to provide motivation, such as encouragement to get out of bed and go out to college or work, and carry out simple tasks such as shopping, housework and repairs, and provide help with administrative tasks or personal care, if required. Why choose supported living services? Supported living services may provide a good option in some circumstances – offering flexibility, and perhaps even better value for money than some of the alternatives, whether you fund your own care or receive a personal budget. Supported living services are not regulated by the Care Quality Commission. However, any personal care provided – such as help with washing or preparing food, or help eating meals – is. Such care must not be delivered by the housing owner or operator, but by a registered homecare agency or provider. Finding out more about supported living services The first time you hear about supported living services may be during a care needs assessment by social services. They will let you know about supported living services available locally if it seems like they might meet your needs. Services that support independent living can be provided by the local authority or charities, or they may be run by commercial companies. Find supported living services near you. If a supported living service arrangement is not suitable for you, you may still want to think about personal care at home, wherever you live, and other help, such as equipment that might make your life easier.

About the yellow fever vaccine The yellow fever vaccine is given as a single injection.   You should be vaccinated at least 10 days before you travel, as this will allow enough time for your body to develop protection against the yellow fever infection. Your proof of vaccination certificate (see below) will only become valid after this time. The vaccination provides protection for 95-100% of those who have it. This protection lasts at least 10 years and may even be life-long. Booster doses of yellow fever vaccine Booster doses of the yellow fever vaccine used to be recommended every 10 years for everyone planning another visit to an area where the infection is found. However, experts working for the World Health Organization (WHO) recently suggested that booster doses may not be necessary. Since July 2016, vaccination certificates have been valid for life (they previously expired after 10 years). For the time being, booster doses are only recommended if you are travelling to an at-risk area, you were last vaccinated more than 10 years ago, and: you need a valid certificate of vaccination, or you were originally vaccinated when you were pregnant, were less than two years old, or had a weakened immune system (for example, due to an HIV infection or preparation for a bone marrow transplant) Your local designated yellow fever vaccination centre (see below) should be able to advise you if you’re not sure whether you need to have a booster vaccination before travelling. Where can I be vaccinated against yellow fever? Yellow fever vaccinations can only be given at designated centres. For a centre to become a designated yellow fever vaccination centre, it must register with the appropriate authority. In the UK, this is either: the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) Health Protection Scotland (HPS) Find your nearest yellow fever vaccination centre. The vaccination is not usually available for free on the NHS, so you will normally have to pay for it. On average, a single vaccination costs around £60. Certificate of yellow fever vaccination Under regulations set out by the WHO, anyone travelling to a country or area where there is a risk of picking up or spreading the virus that causes yellow fever must have an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP). You can find a list of all the countries that require you to have an ICVP (PDF, 436kb) on the WHO website. You can also search the destination information on the NHS Fit for Travel website to find out whether the places you are visiting require an ICVP. An ICVP is not required for entry into the UK. If you lose your certificate, you may be able to get another one reissued as long as you have details of the vaccination batch number and the date you had the vaccination. Exemption from yellow fever vaccination Some people may be advised not to have the yellow fever vaccine because of the risk of potential side effects or complications. This includes: babies under nine months of age – babies who are six to nine months old may sometimes be vaccinated, but only if the risk of getting yellow fever during travel is unavoidable pregnant and breastfeeding women people over 60 years of age people with weakened immune systems – such as people with HIV and those receiving radiotherapy people who are severely allergic to any of the ingredients in the vaccine – including people with allergies to eggs, as the vaccine contains small amounts of egg If the yellow fever vaccination is not advised, you may be issued with an exemption letter, which may be accepted by immigration authorities. If you have not been vaccinated, you will need to take particular care to prevent mosquito bites while travelling – for example, by using insect repellent and mosquito nets. Side effects of the yellow fever vaccine Up to one in every three people experience mild side effects after having the yellow fever vaccine, such as: a headache muscle pain a mild fever soreness at the injection site Reactions at the injection site usually occur one to five days after being vaccinated. The other side effects may last for up to two weeks. Rare side effects of the yellow fever vaccine There are also some very rare, but potentially serious, side effects that can occur, including: an allergic reaction to the vaccine; this occurs around once for every 130,000 doses given yellow fever vaccine-associated neurological disease (YEL-AND) – a condition affecting the brain and nervous system, causing symptoms such as confusion and problems with movement and co-ordination; this occurs around once for every 250,000 doses given yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) – a condition affecting your internal organs, which can lead to organ failure in some cases; this occurs around once for every 330,000 doses given The risk of YEL-AND and YEL-AVD is higher in young babies and elderly people, which is why vaccination is not always recommended for these groups.

(101, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/Equality-Act-disability-discrimination.aspx', 'The Equality Act', 'Disability, discrimination and the Equality Act - Care and support - NHS Choices', '', 'The Equality Act is a law that came into effect in October 2010. It protects people from being discriminated against because of their disability. It also protects people from being discriminated against because of their caring responsibilities. The Equality Act replaced previous laws protecting people from discrimination, including most of the Disability Discrimination Act.  Learn more about the Equality Act in Equality Act 2010: What do I need to know? Disability quick start guide (PDF, 309.82kb). Do I count as ''disabled''? The Equality Act introduced several changes in the law that relate to disabled people. It uses a broader definition of disability, which means more people are protected than with previous legislation. A person is defined as being disabled under the Equality Act if:  they have a physical or mental impairment the impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities For an impairment to have a "substantial" effect, it must have more than a minor or trivial effect on someone''s ability to do everyday tasks such as preparing food, having a conversation, getting washed, walking or using transport. "Long term" means the impairment must last at least 12 months or be expected to last at least 12 months. There are special rules about recurring or fluctuating conditions. GOV.UK has guidance about the Act''s definition of disability. Someone who has cancer or multiple sclerosis (MS) or is living with HIV will automatically be considered to be a disabled person under the Act. The Macmillan website has more information about discrimination at work against people with cancer as well as a guide for employers (PDF, 875kb). Some conditions are excluded from the Equality Act''s definition of disability. This includes drug and alcohol misuse. However, someone with one of these conditions could still be classed as disabled if they have an impairment that meets the Act''s definition. The Act will look at the effects of their impairment, rather than its cause, so someone who has long-term depression as a result of alcohol misuse could be a disabled person under the Act. In most cases, the Equality Act also protects people who met its conditions for disability in the past but are no longer disabled. This could include someone who was diagnosed with cancer but has now recovered. Protection for disabled people at work and as consumers People with disabilities are already protected against discrimination in educational settings, as well as employment-related discrimination and harassment. Generally employers won''t be able to ask potential employees about their health or disability before offering them a job because of the Equality Act. Employers will only be able to ask these sorts of questions if there''s a good reason. Find out more about disability in the workplace. Organisations have an "anticipatory" duty, which means they can''t wait until a disabled person wants to use their services, but must think in advance (and on an ongoing basis) about what disabled people with a range of impairments might reasonably need. The Equality Act also protects disabled people against direct discrimination and harassment when buying goods and using services. This could include shopping, going to a leisure centre, using public transport or eating at a restaurant. It also covers services such as health and social care. Employers and service providers must make "reasonable adjustments" for a disabled person if they would otherwise be at a substantial disadvantage compared with non-disabled people. Reasonable adjustments in the workplace could include adapted equipment or adjusted hours to help a disabled person do their job. For a service provider or business, a reasonable adjustment could be a ramp to increase the accessibility of their premises, or disability awareness training for their staff. What''s considered a reasonable adjustment will depend on the individual situation. If there''s a particular service or business that you visit often, it may be helpful to speak to them about ways they could meet your needs. GOV.UK has more information on reasonable adjustments for workers who are disabled. The Equality Act also outlines the principle of indirect discrimination by disability. Indirect discrimination can happen if something that applies equally to everyone has a particularly adverse effect on disabled people. However, it won''t apply if an employer or service provider can show they have a fair and balanced reason for their actions. Discriminating against older people People are already protected against age-related discrimination and harassment at work. The Equality Act also includes provisions that protect older people against discrimination and harassment when buying goods or using services. This can include: direct discrimination – where someone is unfairly treated in comparison with another; for example, where an older person is refused admission to a gym or a nightclub simply because of their age, where a younger person would be admitted indirect discrimination – where a rule or practice applies to everyone, but puts a particular group of people at a disadvantage; for example, where an optician allows payment for spectacles by instalments, but restricts eligibility to those in work: this practice applies to everyone, but puts pensioners at a disadvantage harassment related to age – this is unwanted conduct that violates a person''s dignity or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for that person; for example, where a computer salesperson makes assumptions about an older person''s ability to use a computer, and makes offensive remarks and jokes about this Page last reviewed: 15/01/2015 Next review due: 15/01/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

(103, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/disability-living-allowance.aspx', 'Disability Living Allowance', 'Disability Living Allowance - Care and support guide - NHS Choices', '', 'Disability Living Allowance (DLA) is a benefit that helps with the extra costs that disabled people face as a result of their disabilities. DLA is not means-tested, and it is tax free. You don’t need to have paid any National Insurance contributions to claim DLA. In April 2013, a new benefit called Personal Independence Payment (PIP) started to replace DLA for working-age adults (aged 16 to 64) with a disability, in a controlled and phased approach. You can now only make a new claim for DLA if you''re claiming for a child under 16. For more information, visit DLA for children on GOV.UK. DLA has two components (parts): mobility and care. People can receive just one component or both together. The care component is paid at three different rates and the mobility component is paid at two rates. Whether someone qualifies for DLA, and what rate they''re paid, will depend on the amount of personal care they need or the level of their mobility difficulties outdoors. Claiming PIP Anyone aged 16 to 64 making a new disability benefit claim must now apply for PIP. Most DLA claimants will not be assessed for PIP until at least October 2015 – but in some areas, claimants are already being asked to claim PIP. Qualifying ages for DLA Claiming DLA if you''ve reached pension age If you’ve reached pension age and haven’t claimed DLA before, you should claim Attendance Allowance instead. If you’ve reached pension age, and you had a claim for DLA that ended within the last year, you can make a renewal claim for DLA. If it’s more than a year since your DLA award ended, you must claim Attendance Allowance instead. If you''ve reached pension age and are already getting DLA Once you have qualified for DLA, it’s possible to continue getting it after you reach 65. However, there are some differences that can affect changes to a DLA claim if you’re 65 or over. If you already get the mobility component and your mobility problems get worse, you can’t move to a higher rate of mobility component after you’ve reached pension age. You also can''t start to claim the mobility component if you only received the care component previously. If you’ve reached pension age, you’re only getting the mobility component of DLA and you start to have care needs, you’ll normally only start getting the DLA care component if you qualify for it at the middle or highest rate. If you would only qualify for the lowest rate care component, you won’t get this unless you can show you qualified for it before your birthday. DLA care component has a six-month qualifying period for people who have reached pension age. To qualify for DLA, you have to show you have been disabled throughout the three months before the date DLA is due to start being paid. You must also show that you’re likely to satisfy the disability rule for at least six months after it starts. DLA for care needs Lowest rate care component You will be paid the lowest rate of the DLA care component if you need attention, including help with washing, dressing, eating, help with communication, or prompting to do something. You qualify if this help is needed for a significant portion of the day (usually at least an hour in total) and you are unable to do something requiring physical and mental co-ordination, such as cooking a main meal. Middle rate care component You will be paid the middle rate of the DLA care component if in addition to the requirements for the lowest rate, you also need: supervision to avoid putting yourself or others in substantial danger someone to be with you while they are on dialysis You will qualify if this help is either: attention, needed frequently throughout the day supervision, needed for most of the day prolonged or repeated attention during the night, or someone needs to watch over you at night someone to be with you while they are on dialysis two or more times a week Highest rate care component You will be paid the highest rate of the DLA care component if in addition to the requirements for the middle rate, you are able to show that you have a pattern of needs that happen during both the day and the night. DLA for mobility needs To get the mobility component of DLA, a person''s disability must be severe enough for them to have any of the following difficulties: they are unable or virtually unable to walk, or have no feet or legs  they are assessed as being both "100% disabled" because of loss of eyesight and not less than 80% disabled because of deafness and need someone with them when they are outdoors they are severely mentally impaired with severe behavioural problems and qualify for the highest rate of the care component the effort of walking could threaten their life or seriously affect their health  they need guidance or supervision from another person when walking outdoors in unfamiliar places they have been certified as severely sight impaired and have visual acuity below a certain level Lower rate mobility component of DLA You will get the lower rate of the mobility component of DLA if you need guidance (such as help avoiding obstacles) or supervision from another person when walking outdoors in unfamiliar places. The mobility component takes into account a person''s ability to walk outdoors. If you have problems walking indoors, that may count towards the care component of DLA. You have to show that the guidance or supervision you need will, in fact, help you to walk outdoors. For instance, if you are agoraphobic but can be persuaded to go outdoors if someone is with you, then you may qualify. Higher rate mobility component You will get the lower rate of the mobility component of DLA if you have a physical disability that affects your ability to walk outdoors. People with severe learning disabilities that have a physical basis may qualify for the higher rate of the mobility component. The higher rate mobility component of DLA is paid if a person''s disability is severe enough for them to have any of the following walking difficulties: they are unable or virtually unable to walk (this may be due to symptoms such as breathlessness, dizziness or pain) they have no feet or legs  they are assessed to be both "100% disabled" because of loss of eyesight, and not less than "80% disabled" because of deafness, and they need someone with them when they are outdoors  they have a severe mental impairment with severe behavioural problems and qualify for the highest rate of care component the effort of walking could threaten their life or be likely to lead to a serious deterioration in their health they have been certified as severely sight impaired and have a visual acuity of less than 3/60 (meaning they can only read the top line of an eye test chart from three metres away) they have been certified as severely sight impaired and have a visual acuity of between 3/60 and 6/60 (meaning they can only read the top line of an eye test chart from six metres away), a complete loss of peripheral vision, and severely restricted central vision (sometimes called tunnel vision) Your walking ability may vary from day to day. It can be useful to keep a diary so you can describe both good and bad days. If you normally use an aid, prosthesis or medication, that will be taken into account. Claiming DLA for a terminal illness The law on DLA says that someone is regarded as terminally ill if they have a progressive disease and their death from that disease can reasonably be expected within six months. Although there must be a reasonable expectation that death will occur within six months, Attendance Allowance will normally continue to be paid for three years under the special rules. At the end of this time, the claimant may be asked for further information about their health and how it affects them so that their entitlement can be reassessed. If your claim is accepted under the special rules, you will automatically qualify for the highest rate care component of DLA. You will not automatically qualify for the mobility component of DLA. However, if you satisfy the disability rules for either the lower or higher rate of the mobility component, you will not have to wait for the usual qualifying period. If you claim under the special rules for terminal illness, it is a good idea to discuss the claim with your GP or consultant. The GP or consultant will need to complete a form (called DS1500), which asks for information about the claimant''s diagnosis and treatment. The DS1500 form should be sent to the Disability Benefit Centre with a DLA claim form. You can get a claim form: at any Jobcentre Plus office  by ringing the Disability Benefits helpline on 0345 712 3456 online When claiming under the special rules, the questions about help with care do not have to be completed. However, if a claim is being made for the mobility component of DLA then the questions about mobility need to be completed. Making a claim on behalf of someone else A claim can also be made on another person’s behalf by a carer, family member, friend or professional person. The person who is terminally ill doesn''t have to sign the claim form. They will simply be notified that they have been awarded the benefit, and payment will be made to them. DLA and children To receive DLA, a child under the age of 16 must satisfy all of the rules that someone over the age of 16 would have to satisfy. They also need to demonstrate that they need a lot more attention and supervision than other children of the same age. However, if they have a terminal illness, these rules do not have to be satisfied. Because of these extra rules, there is a separate DLA claim form for children. Babies do not qualify for DLA until they are three months old. If you are under 16 and terminally ill, you can make a claim for DLA under special rules that ensure the claim is dealt with quickly. DLA care component The only way that someone under 16 can qualify for the lowest rate care component is if they need attention for a significant portion of the day. There is no minimum age for the care component, but because of the three-month qualifying period the component cannot be paid until your baby is three months old (unless they are terminally ill). DLA mobility component The higher rate of the mobility component can only be paid from the age of three. The lower rate of the mobility component can only be paid from the age of five. The three months before a child’s third or fifth birthday can count as the qualifying period, so that DLA can be paid from the third or fifth birthday onwards. To qualify, you have to show that the child needs a lot more guidance or supervision than other children of the same age. The government''s official online source of information on Employment and Support Allowance is GOV.UK.

Shared Lives: providing a home for those who need care Media last reviewed: 30/09/2015 Next review due: 30/09/2017 Shared lives schemes are designed to support adults with learning disabilities, mental health problems, or other needs that make it harder for them to live on their own. The schemes match an adult who has care needs with an approved shared lives carer. These carers share their family and community life, and give care and support to the adult with care needs. Shared lives schemes are available across the country and are an alternative to traditional kinds of care, such as care homes. The schemes are sometimes also known as adult placement schemes. Why shared lives schemes can be a good option Sharing a home, family and community life with a shared lives carer as part of a shared lives scheme will allow you to get to know and bond with the person who will consistently provide your support. Some people will move in with their shared lives carer. Others, including people with dementia, for instance, will be regular daytime visitors, while some will combine daytime and overnight visits. Before support starts, you will get to know the shared lives carer and decide whether you want to spend time together. Sometimes people use a shared lives scheme as a way of learning the skills they need to live independently, and to help them put down roots in their area or community before moving into a place of their own. You can find details of local shared lives services on NHS Choices – use your postcode to search for local shared lives services. Each service listing will tell you: contact details whether the service is accepting new clients ratings from people who''ve used the service whether the service meets the national standards set by the government regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) The profiles describe the services on offer, details of staff, and reviews from people who use the services drawn from a range of online reviewing websites. Interested in becoming a shared lives carer? Shared lives schemes rely on approved shared lives carers. The schemes have to be registered with the CQC. Carers are trained and vetted by the scheme. The schemes pay the self-employed shared lives carers, but not by the hour. Carers – as well as their families and friends – contribute a lot that is unpaid. If you''re interested in becoming a shared lives carer, you can find out next steps from the charity Shared Lives Plus, which represents shared lives schemes.

The first step is to ask the Carer''s Allowance Unit to look at the decision again – this is known as a "mandatory reconsideration". If you''re unsatisfied with the outcome of this, you can appeal to an independent appeal tribunal. If you''re unhappy about the way your claim has been dealt with, you might also want to make a complaint. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) itself can look at decisions again to check they''re correct. If the DWP looks at your decision and stops the benefit, you can also challenge that decision. Considerations when challenging a Carer''s Allowance decision You can make an appeal to a tribunal against many decisions made about a benefits claim, but in some cases an appeal is not possible. Decisions that can be appealed include whether you are entitled to the benefit, the rate you are entitled to, and whether it can be backdated. However, you can''t appeal decisions such as whether your payments should be suspended, or whether you should receive an interim payment of benefits. If you want a decision to be looked at again or you have appealed to a tribunal following a mandatory reconsideration, get your evidence together as soon as you can. The evidence could include: notes or a diary about the amount or sort of care you provide copies of letters notifying the person you care for of disability benefits awards  payslips or your contract of employment testimony from family, friends or other carers – for example, confirming dates when you have taken breaks from caring because alternative care was provided  Challenging a benefit decision can be complicated, and you may find advice or having someone represent you at a tribunal helpful. You can get help finding a solicitor or adviser from your local law centre. GOV.UK has more information on the process of challenging a benefit decision. Overpayments of Carer''s Allowance Overpayments of Carer''s Allowance do happen. For example, if Disability Living Allowance (DLA) or Attendance Allowance (AA) has stopped being paid to the person you are looking after and you don''t notify the DWP, this could mean your Carer''s Allowance continues to be paid when you are no longer eligible. Sometimes an overpayment may be the result of an administrative error on the part of the DWP. You will not have to pay the overpayment back unless you failed to disclose information or misrepresented information. If you believe you are being wrongly asked to repay money, seek advice from a welfare benefits specialist or a legal advice service. Many overpayments are caused by innocent mistakes. Just because there has been an overpayment does not mean you have acted dishonestly. However, if the DWP believes you have committed benefit fraud, it could try to prosecute you. Alternatively, you may be given the option of paying a penalty, which would be 30% of the overpayment. If you are accused of acting dishonestly or fraudulently, you''ll need legal advice as soon as possible. Failure to disclose important facts related to your benefit claim If you fail to inform the DWP about an important fact about yourself or your circumstances, this is called "failure to disclose". If this causes the DWP to make a wrong decision about your claim, you could be overpaid benefit and the DWP may recover the overpayment from you. Anything that affects your entitlement to the benefit could count as an important fact, but this will depend on your particular circumstances. You are expected to disclose a fact if the DWP told you it is the type of fact you need to report and you knew of the fact in question. If you are challenging a failure to disclose overpayment decision, you should explain: the nature of the information you gave to the DWP in relation to the benefit where you sent the information and when whether you have any proof that you provided information, such as receipts for documents handed in at a benefit office, or recorded delivery receipts Even if the DWP did not tell you the fact that caused the overpayment was one that should be disclosed, you still need to inform the DWP of any changes that might affect entitlement to benefit.

Can I get the vaccine without the measles component? We are due to go travelling and my 14-month-old son will have his MMR jab three weeks before we leave. Will he have developed immunity before we go? And can he have travel vaccines at the same time as the MMR? My child is receiving their MMR jab tomorrow. How long should I leave it before taking them swimming? How long does protection from MMR last? I have heard that mumps is going around. I thought that MMR prevented mumps, so why is this happening? My child had one dose of MMR, but still got measles. Why didn''t the vaccine work?  Should MMR vaccination be speeded up when there''s a measles outbreak?  Can my child have the Hib/MenC jab with the MMR and pneumococcal jabs? Yes, these vaccines can be given together. The childhood vaccination schedule recommends that MMR is given at around 12 to 13 months of age, and at the same time as the Hib/Men C vaccine and the pneumo jab. My child is allergic to eggs. Can she have the MMR vaccination? Yes, the MMR vaccine can be safely given to children who have a severe allergy to egg. This is because the MMR vaccine is grown on chick cells, not the egg white or yolk. If you have any concerns, however, talk to your health visitor, practice nurse or doctor. Read more about the effects of egg and other vaccine ingredients. Can the MMR vaccination be given as three separate injections? No, not on the NHS. The MMR vaccine consists of a combination of three individual vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella in a single shot. The NHS does not recommend single measles, mumps or rubella vaccines, as there is no evidence to support their use or to suggest that they are safer than MMR. Having single vaccines could also put your child at risk of catching measles, mumps or rubella in the time between the doses of each of the vaccines. Some private clinics in the UK offer single vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella, but the NHS does not keep a list of them because clinics that offer these privately are unlicensed, which means there are no checks on their safety and effectiveness. No country in the world recommends MMR and then offers parents a choice of having single vaccines instead. Every independent expert group around the world (including the World Health Organization) supports the use of MMR, and none support the use of single vaccines.  Read about why single vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella are not available on the NHS. I don''t know if my teenage daughter has had her second MMR jab. What should I do? For full protection, two doses of MMR are recommended. If you''re not sure whether your daughter has had one or both doses of MMR, ask her GP. The Red Book would also tell you her vaccination history, if you still have it. Your daughter could have one MMR dose now and the second MMR dose in three months'' time. An extra MMR dose will not cause any harm. Does the MMR jab contain thiomersal (mercury)? No, the MMR vaccine has never contained thiomersal – a preservative containing mercury that is used in some vaccines. Read more about vaccine ingredients. My son is due for his MMR jab, but I am concerned about the connection between autism and MMR. Could I put him at risk? This really shouldn''t be a worry, as there is no evidence of any link between MMR and autism. Read more about the safety of the MMR vaccine. Our son was born six weeks prematurely. Should we delay getting him vaccinated? No. Babies should receive their vaccinations according to the recommended schedule, at around 12 to 13 months of age, irrespective of whether they are born prematurely. Read more about vaccines for premature babies in this rundown of the top 10 questions that parents have about baby vaccinations. A month after I got vaccinated for MMR, I found out I was pregnant. Will my baby be ok? Almost certainly, yes. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that there will be no harm to your baby. However, it''s worth mentioning this to your midwife or GP at the earliest possible opportunity, just to be on the safe side. Can my child have the MMR vaccine if they have single vaccines? Yes, your child can still have the MMR vaccine on the NHS if they''ve already had single vaccines privately. Be aware, though, that MMR is a "live" vaccine, so the two doses should be given at least four weeks apart. If your child has received a "live" single vaccine, they will have to wait at least four weeks until they can have the MMR vaccine. Read more about the difference between "live" and "killed" vaccines. My son is 18 and has been asked to have a second MMR jab before university. Is this sensible? Many universities recommend that their students have a shot of MMR before they arrive, because there have been outbreaks of mumps among unprotected students. Mumps vaccine is only available on the NHS as the MMR vaccine. If your son never had MMR as a child, or was only partially vaccinated, see your GP to arrange for him to have MMR vaccination. Even if he has already had two doses of MMR, having a third dose to make sure he is protected against mumps will not cause any harm.     Read more about why teens need to be vaccinated against mumps. If my child develops a mild case of measles after their first MMR vaccine, are they contagious to non-vaccinated children? No. Post-vaccination symptoms are not infectious, so your child will not pass anything on to non-vaccinated children.   My baby had measles at the age of six weeks. Can I get the vaccine without the measles component? No, the MMR vaccine is not available without the measles component, but it won''t do your baby any harm to be vaccinated against measles, even after having the illness. MMR vaccination will help to protect your baby against mumps and rubella, and will also boost the antibodies they have already developed against measles.   We''re going travelling and my 14-month-old son is due to have his MMR jab three weeks before we leave. Will he have developed immunity in time? Immunity to measles, mumps and rubella starts to develop after two weeks, so having his MMR three weeks before travelling is fine. It is also fine for him to have his other travel vaccines on the same day as the MMR.    My child is receiving their MMR jab tomorrow. How long should I leave it before taking them swimming? There is no reason why your child cannot resume normal activities, including swimming, straight after receiving their MMR jab.    How long does protection from MMR last? It seems to be very long lasting. Virtually everyone (more than 99%) will be protected against measles and rubella for more than 20 years after two doses of MMR. Protection against mumps after two doses of MMR is a little lower (90-95%) and appears to gradually decline. Mumps in vaccinated people is, however, much less likely to lead to complications such as meningitis or orchitis (painful swelling of the testes), and vaccinated people are less likely to require admission to hospital.       I have heard that mumps is going around. I thought that MMR prevented mumps, so why is this happening? You need two doses of mumps vaccine to be best protected. Mumps vaccine is only available on the NHS as a component of the MMR vaccine. MMR was introduced in 1988, with a second dose introduced in 1996, so many young adults may have had only single vaccines of measles and rubella and/or combined measles-rubella vaccines. This led to a large epidemic of mumps among this age group in 2004/2005. Since then, we''ve continued to see smaller outbreaks of mumps in universities and colleges every three to four years. During these outbreaks, the highest risk is to completely unvaccinated students, but milder cases have also occurred in students who have had one or two doses of MMR. So, it''s likely that some vaccinated students can catch mumps and pass the infection on to their close contacts without even knowing it. If you''ve never had the MMR vaccine, you should have one dose now and another one month later. Read more about teens and mumps. My child had one dose of MMR and still caught measles. Why didn''t the vaccine work? Up to 1 in 10 children with measles received a single dose of vaccination. This is to be expected, as a single dose of MMR vaccine protects only 9 in 10 children. That''s why children need a second dose. After a second dose, 9 in 10 of those who didn''t respond to the first dose will be protected – so the second dose boosts protection to almost 100%. Should MMR vaccination be speeded up when there''s a measles outbreak? To get the best protection, children should be vaccinated with the MMR vaccine at the scheduled times – between 12 and 13 months of age and again at 3 years, 4 months. In areas where there are measles outbreaks, the gap between doses can be reduced so that the children who didn''t respond to the first dose are protected with the second more quickly. Read what to do in a measles outbreak.     Page last reviewed: 04/08/2015 Next review due: 04/08/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

(109, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/mental-capacity.aspx', 'Mental capacity', 'What is the Mental Capacity Act? - Care and support - NHS Choices', '', 'The Mental Capacity Act (MCA) is designed to protect and empower individuals who may lack the mental capacity to make their own decisions about their care and treatment. It is a law that applies to individuals aged 16 and over. Examples of people who may lack capacity include those with:  dementia a severe learning disability a brain injury a mental health condition a stroke unconsciousness caused by an anaesthetic or sudden accident However, just because a person has one of these conditions does not necessarily mean they lack the capacity to make a specific decision.  Someone can lack capacity to make some decisions (for example, to decide on complex financial issues) but still have the capacity to make other decisions (for example, to decide what items to buy at the local shop). The MCA says: Everyone has the right to make his or her own decisions. Health and care professionals should always assume an individual has the capacity to make a decision themselves, unless it is proved otherwise through a capacity assessment. Individuals must be given help to make a decision themselves. This might include, for example, providing the person with information in a format that is easier for them to understand. Just because someone makes what those caring for them consider to be an "unwise" decision, they should not be treated as lacking the capacity to make that decision. Everyone has the right to make their own life choices, where they have the capacity to do so. Where someone is judged not to have the capacity to make a specific decision (following a capacity assessment), that decision can be taken for them, but it must be in their best interests. Treatment and care provided to someone who lacks capacity should be the least restrictive of their basic rights and freedoms possible, while still providing the required treatment and care. The MCA also allows people to express their preferences for care and treatment in case they lack capacity to make these decisions. It also allows them to appoint a trusted person to make a decision on their behalf should they lack capacity in the future. People should also be provided with an independent advocate who will support them to make decisions in certain situations, such as serious treatment or where the individual might have significant restrictions placed on their freedom and rights in their best interests. Read on or click on the links below for more information: How ''mental capacity'' is determined Supporting decision-making Making best interests decisions for someone Alternatives to making a decision for someone Advance statements and decisions Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPAs) Court of Protection Professionals'' duties under the Mental Capacity Act  How ''mental capacity'' is determined The MCA sets out a two-stage test of capacity. 1) Does the individual concerned have an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, their mind or brain, whether as a result of a condition, illness, or external factors such as alcohol or drug use? 2) Does the impairment or disturbance mean the individual is unable to make a specific decision when they need to? Individuals can lack capacity to make some decisions but have capacity to make others, so it is vital to consider whether the individual lacks capacity to make the specific decision. Also, capacity can fluctuate with time – an individual may lack capacity at one point in time, but may be able to make the same decision at a later point in time. Where appropriate, individuals should be allowed the time to make a decision themselves. In relation to the second question, the MCA says a person is unable to make a decision if they cannot: understand the information relevant to the decision retain that information use or weigh up that information as part of the process of making the decision If they aren''t able to do any of the above three things or communicate their decision (by talking, using sign language, or through any other means), the MCA says they will be treated as unable to make the specific decision in question. Mental capacity and supporting decision-making Before deciding an individual lacks capacity to make a particular decision, appropriate steps must be taken to enable them to make the decision themselves. For example: Does the individual have all the relevant information they need? Have they been given information on any alternatives? Could information be explained or presented in a way that is easier to understand (for example, by using simple language or visual aids)? Have different methods of communication been explored, such as non-verbal communication? Could anyone else help with communication, such as a family member, carer, or advocate? Are there particular times of day when the individual''s understanding is better? Are there particular locations where the individual may feel more at ease? Could the decision be delayed until a time when the individual might be better able to make the decision? Making best interests decisions for someone If someone is found to lack the capacity to make a decision and such a decision needs to be made for them, the MCA states the decision must be made in their best interests. The MCA sets out a checklist of things to consider when deciding what''s in an individual''s best interests. It says you should: Encourage participation – do whatever is possible to permit or encourage the individual to take part. Identify all relevant circumstances – try to identify the things the individual lacking capacity would take into account if they were making the decision themselves. Find out the individual''s views – including their past and present wishes and feelings, and any beliefs or values. Avoid discrimination – do not make assumptions on the basis of age, appearance, condition or behaviour. Assess whether the individual might regain capacity – if they might, could the decision be postponed? Consulting with others is a vital part of best interest decision-making. People who should be consulted include anyone previously named by the person concerned, anyone engaged in caring for them, close relatives, friends or others who take an interest in their welfare, any attorney appointed under a Lasting Power of Attorney or Enduring Power of Attorney, and any deputy appointed by the Court of Protection to make decisions for the person. Finding alternatives to making a decision on someone else''s behalf Before somebody makes a decision or acts on behalf of a person who lacks capacity to make a decision or to consent to an act, they must always question if they can do something else that would interfere less with the person''s basic rights and freedoms. This is called finding the "least restrictive alternative". It includes considering whether there is a need to act or make a decision at all. Where there is more than one option, it is important to explore ways that would be less restrictive or allow the most freedom for a person who lacks capacity. However, the final decision must always allow the original purpose of the decision or act to be achieved. Any decision or action must still be in the best interests of the person who lacks capacity. So sometimes it may be necessary to choose an option that is not the least restrictive alternative if that option is in the person''s best interests. Deprivation of liberty In certain cases, the restrictions placed upon an individual who lacks capacity to consent to the arrangements of their care may amount to "deprivation of liberty". This must be judged on a case-by-case basis. Where it appears a deprivation of liberty might occur, the provider of care (usually a hospital or a care home) has to apply to their local authority, who will then arrange an assessment of the individual''s care and treatment to decide if the deprivation of liberty is in the best interests of the individual concerned. If it is, the local authority will grant a legal authorisation. If it is not, the care and treatment package must be changed – otherwise, an unlawful deprivation of liberty will occur. This system is known as the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards. If you suspect a deprivation of liberty may occur, the first step should be to talk to the care provider and then possibly the local authority. Advance statements and decisions An advance statement is a written statement that sets down a person''s preferences, wishes, beliefs and values regarding their future care. It is not legally binding. The aim is to provide a guide for anyone who might have to make decisions in someone''s best interests if they have lost the capacity to make decisions or communicate their decision. An advance statement can cover any aspect of a person''s future health or social care. This could include:  how they want any religious or spiritual beliefs they hold to be reflected in their care where they would like to be cared for – for example, at home or in a hospital, nursing home or hospice how they like to do things – for example, if they prefer a shower instead of a bath, or like to sleep with the light on concerns about practical issues – for example, who will look after their pet if they become ill Find out more about making advance statements. An advance decision (sometimes known as an advance decision to refuse treatment, an ADRT, or a living will) is a legally binding decision that allows someone aged 18 or over, while still capable, to refuse specified medical treatment for a time in the future when they may lack capacity to consent to or refuse that treatment. An advance decision must be valid and applicable to current circumstances. If it is, it has the same effect as a decision made by a person with capacity – healthcare professionals must follow the decision. If the advance decision refuses life-sustaining treatment, it must: be in writing, signed and witnessed  state clearly that the decision applies even if life is at risk People who make an advance decision may wish to consider letting their family, friends and carers know about it. Find out more about advance decisions. Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPA) You can grant a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) to another person (or people) to enable them to make decisions about your health and welfare, or decisions about your property and financial affairs. Separate legal documents are made for each of these decisions, appointing one or more attorneys for each. An Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) under the previous law was restricted to making decisions over property and affairs, which includes financial affairs and accessing the person''s information. An EPA made before the Mental Capacity Act came into force on October 1 2007 remains valid. Powers of attorney can be made at any time when the person making it has the mental capacity to do so, provided they are 18 or over. Both an EPA and LPA must be registered. An LPA can be registered at any time, but a personal welfare LPA will only be effective once the person has lost the capacity to make their own decisions. When acting under an LPA, an attorney must: make sure the MCA''s statutory principles are followed check whether the person has the capacity to make that particular decision for themselves – if they do, a personal welfare LPA cannot be used and the person must make the decision In addition, the Court of Protection will be able to appoint deputies who can also take decisions on health and welfare, as well as in financial matters, if the person concerned lacks the capacity to make a decision. They will come into action when the court needs to delegate an ongoing series of decisions rather than one decision. If the person concerned already has an LPA appointed, they won''t normally need a deputy as well. The Office of the Public Guardian registers LPAs and EPAs and supervises court-appointed deputies. It provides evidence to the Court of Protection and information and guidance to the public. The Public Guardian works with a range of agencies, such as the financial sector, police and social services, to investigate concerns. The Court of Protection The Court of Protection oversees the operation of the Mental Capacity Act and deals with all issues, including financial and serious healthcare matters, concerning people who lack the mental capacity to make their own decisions. The court also tries to resolve all disputes when the person''s carer, healthcare worker or social worker disagree about what''s in the person''s best interests, or when the views of the attorneys conflict in relation to property and welfare. The court hears important cases, such as whether the NHS should withdraw treatment, whether a serious medical treatment decision is in a person''s best interests, or whether it is in a person''s best interests to be deprived of their liberty. Cases can be brought to the court by family members, as well as advocates and professionals involved in decisions. Professionals'' duties under the Mental Capacity Act The Mental Capacity Act applies to all professions – doctors, nurses, social workers, occupational therapists, health care assistants, and support staff. These staff and their employers have a duty to ensure they are trained in its implementation. All staff working in the NHS and in social care are expected to have an understanding of the act as it relates to their own responsibilities. Most trusts and local authorities will have a Mental Capacity Act lead who provides specialist advice on the implementation.

It''s essential that you know about safe moving and handling so you don''t hurt yourself or them. For example, you may find that you need to help an ill or disabled person in the following areas: In the bedroom  getting in or out of bed turning over in bed sitting up in bed In the bathroom bathing showering using the toilet Elsewhere  sitting in a chair standing walking getting up from the floor after a fall getting in and out of a car or other vehicle Common carers'' injuries The most common injuries carers experience are back injuries. Injuring your back will limit your movement and your ability to care for someone. It could take a long time for you to recover. Lifting someone incorrectly can also damage fragile skin, cause shoulder and neck injuries, increase existing breathing difficulties, or cause bruising or cuts. Lifting checklist If you are regularly lifting someone, it''s best to get trained or see the best techniques demonstrated. Before attempting to move someone, ask yourself:  Do they need help to move? Do they require help or supervision? Have you told them you''re moving them? How heavy are they? Are you healthy and strong enough to move them? Is there anyone who could help you? How long will it take?  Is there enough space around you? Are there any obstacles in the way? Are you wearing suitable clothing and shoes – for example, if you are on a slippery or damp surface? If you have assessed the situation and have decided to move the person, make sure you: never lift above shoulder height make sure your feet are stable take a firm hold keep any weight close to your body keep your back straight and bend your knees lift as smoothly as possible The York Carers Centre has a video called Moving and handling at home: a carers'' guide to what not to do, which you may find helpful to watch. Support services if you need help with lifting If you find it difficult to help someone move around, your local authority has a responsibility to consider your needs as a carer and the needs of the person you care for. Since April 2015, local authorities have a duty to support people whose needs are eligible for support. This is explained in more detail in the factsheet Accessing needs and determining eligibility on the GOV.UK website. Contact the local authority and ask for an assessment for the person you look after, as well as a carer''s assessment to help you. For advice and guidance on moving and handling, ask for an occupational therapy assessment. You may be given free specialist equipment to help you, such as hoists, stand aids, transfer boards or slide sheets. You may also be able to find free training courses, which will teach you safe handling methods. Buying equipment You may decide you need specialist moving equipment. Before you buy any equipment, get advice from a healthcare professional such as an occupational therapist or a social worker. Try all equipment before you buy it. If you''re considering buying an expensive item, ask to use the equipment for a trial period in the home of the person you''re looking after. For information on equipment, contact the Disabled Living Foundation (DLF). The DLF has an equipment library for simple electronic aids, which allows people to borrow and trial certain products. The Elderly Care site, run by consumer information service Which?, has a guide for choosing and buying mobility products, ranging from walking sticks and walking frames to wheelchairs and mobility scooters. The Elderly Care guide also has a list of useful equipment that can make different rooms of the house safer for the person you care for: using the bedroom, including aids for getting in and out of bed safely safety in the bathroom, including bath seats and hoists using the kitchen, including aids for preparing food and drink using the living room, including sitting safely and devices for watching television more easily Training and courses in moving and handling Your local authority has an obligation to help carers avoid health and safety risks. They may run training courses on manual handling and may provide you with equipment to make caring for someone safer and easier. If your local authority doesn''t offer manual handling courses, ask for a direct payment so you can pay for a course of your choice.

The Care Act and what it means for me Media last reviewed: 30/09/2015 Next review due: 30/09/2017 Your carer''s assessment may identify that you need a break from caring from time to time. Equally, the person you care for may also want to have a break without you. See Accessible day trips and activities for help planning their trip. Replacement care and respite care Replacement care is designed to replace the care that you, as a carer, would normally be giving the person you care for. It may be needed so you can look after your own health and wellbeing, and to take a break from caring. For example, it may be that regular replacement overnight care is needed so you can catch up on your own sleep. In certain situations, respite (temporary) care may be provided by your local authority after your carer''s assessment or after the person you care for has had an assessment. You can use the directory of local carers'' services to find your nearest local carers'' centre or respite service. Your local authority or local carers'' centre can give you information about local support. Carer''s tip from Scope "Some hospices provide respite care; we have found this very helpful. They offer high-level care, which means you can feel comfortable your family member is being cared for properly." Breaks for carers After your carer''s assessment, you may agree with your local authority that you need a break as part of your support plan. If the local authority has agreed to fund the breaks in your care plan, you should be able to choose how you can get your break. Using direct payments to get time off caring After your assessment, if you are eligible for support, your local authority will develop a support plan with you. This will include a personal budget, which you can choose to have as a direct payment. For example, you may choose to:  hire a care worker through an agency so you can go on a shopping trip use the direct payment to pay for a supported holiday for both you and the person you care for – the Short Breaks Network can provide more information on this Alternatives to direct payments You may also want to consider funding or getting a break from caring by: asking for care organised by your local authority getting funding from a benevolent fund or charity paying for a break yourself accessing bursaries and low-cost holidays getting leisure discounts asking friends and family to help Replacement care provided by the local authority Instead of a direct payment, you could ask the local authority to arrange services for you so you can have a break. You can also use a direct payment to fund traditional forms of respite care, and you can pool your direct payments with other people''s to fund services such as day centres. Some local authorities provide vouchers (sometimes called respite grants, or carers'' grants) that can be exchanged for services, such as those offered by care agencies or residential homes. You might be able to use vouchers to pay for extra costs associated with your holiday, including live-in care workers, short-stay residential care, or the cost of more homecare. You might want to consider: homecare services – these can either be day services that give you the chance to do an activity inside or outside the home, or night services that can help you get a proper night''s sleep, or helpers coming to the home of the person you''re caring for. Different types of help can be organised, including sitting with the person you care for and keeping them company, preparing meals, and helping them to get up, washed and dressed. The care workers who come to your home can also provide social activities, such as taking the person you care for to the cinema, pub or shopping. residential or nursing care – this is where the person you''re looking after goes for a short stay in a residential or nursing home. If you can, visit the care or nursing home beforehand so you can see what it''s like.  day care – this is where the person you''re looking after goes to a day centre or takes part in activities away from home. If the replacement care provided is essentially a homecare service for the person needing care and allows you to take a break, it should be considered a service provided to the cared-for person and should therefore be charged to them, not you as the carer. Find out more in Carer''s assessment. Benevolent funds or charity funding You may be able to get help with the cost of going on holiday – either alone or with the person you care for – from a charity or benevolent fund. Your social worker, GP, health visitor or local carers'' support group can give you more information on local benevolent funds and other possible sources of funding. You might find help from the following: Saga Respite for Carers Trust provides a limited number of free holidays each year for carers over the age of 50 and the people they look after. The Family Fund can provide grants towards the cost of holidays for families on a low income who are caring for a child with a severe disability. The Family Holiday Association is a UK charity providing breaks at holiday sites, or grants to help with the cost of a holiday, to low-income families in need of a holiday away from home. You need to be referred by your social worker, GP or health visitor, or by a charity or other welfare agent. The Children''s Country Holiday Fund provides respite breaks in the countryside for young carers aged 6 to 16 and disadvantaged children and young people. Paying for your own breaks If after a carer''s assessment the local authority decides it will not fund a break for you, you can still decide to pay for your own break from caring. How you go about this will depend on your budget and the care options available to you locally. Bursaries and low-cost holidays Some charities offer low-cost holidays or bursaries to families. The national charity Diabetes UK offers support holidays for families and young people. Holidays are low cost and a bursary can be offered to families who can''t afford the travel costs to the UK holiday site. Further information can be found on the Diabetes UK website or on 020 7424 1000 (ask for the care support team). Turn2us, an independent charity, can help you find sources of financial support based on your particular needs and circumstances. Saga, the organisation for people aged 50 and older, has a range of holidays and short breaks to suit carers, including group holidays, holidays for single travellers, special interest holidays, and cruises. Holidays are run throughout the year in the UK and abroad. Saga also offers free holidays for carers through the Saga Respite for Carers Trust. Leisure discounts Many local authorities offer leisure cards. These can help you pay for activities you might like to do when you get a break from caring. They''re often available to people claiming benefits such as Income Support, Employment and Support Allowance, Carer''s Allowance and benefits for disabled people, students over 18 in full-time education, and people over 60. The eligibility requirements vary between areas, but there''s a good chance you''ll qualify if you''re a carer with a low income. Local authorities might make a small annual charge for the card, from £1 up to around £15. You''ll probably be asked for some proof of your entitlement, such as a statement of entitlement for Income Support or an official letter. Discount leisure cards can give you discounts of between 10 and 50% on activities, services and entertainment. These range from sporting activities at local leisure centres to cinemas, theatres, libraries, museums, hairdressers and beauty salons. Help with caring from friends and family Friends and family can provide support for you and the person you care for, especially when you need a break from caring. However, they are not the same as paid professional care workers, and regular caring can place the same stresses on them as on you. They may also be unable or unwilling to commit to giving you a break when you need it. Make sure anyone who takes over from you has all the information they need to look after the person you care for. This may include what they like to eat and at what time, as well as more complex information about the medicines they need to take. Leave a clear list of contacts. These should include the doctor''s number, those of nearby family members and friends, and your own number in case of emergencies. If you have an emergency plan, go through it with the people who will be providing replacement care. If the person you care for needs specialist medical or nursing help while you''re away, arrange this through their GP. This specialist help can include visits from a district nurse or from a community psychiatric nurse. There is no charge for this healthcare, but each NHS body decides what care it will provide. Help with emergency planning Thinking about what you would do in an emergency should be part of the discussion you have as part of your carer''s assessment. The person who carries out your assessment should be able to help you with planning. Carer''s tip from Scope "It might be a good idea to choose someone from your family to be the person''s guardian in case of death. You should ensure that person is familiar, and keep them up-to-date with needs." To create an emergency plan, you will need to note down details of: the name, address and any other contact details of the person you look after who you and the person you look after would like to be contacted in an emergency – this could be friends, family or professional people involved in the person''s care any medication the person is taking any ongoing treatment they need You can register with a carers emergency scheme in your area. If you do, a skilled worker trained to look at your individual situation may be able to help you make your emergency plans. Who can help make an emergency plan? Every carer who has an assessment should be asked about emergencies and offered help to plan for them. The social worker involved in your carer''s assessment should be able to help you with emergency planning.

Does my faith prevent me from giving my child the nasal spray flu vaccine? Can my child have the injected vaccine that doesn''t contain gelatine instead? Does my child have to have the nasal spray flu vaccine? No. As with all immunisations, flu vaccinations for children are optional. Remember, though, that this vaccine will protect them from what can be an unpleasant illness, as well as stopping them spreading flu to vulnerable friends and relatives. Read more about flu. Why can''t under-twos have a nasal spray flu vaccine? The nasal spray vaccine isn''t licensed for children younger than two because it''s linked to wheezing in children this age. Why is it just younger children who are routinely being given the nasal spray flu vaccine? The children''s flu vaccination programme is being rolled out in stages. It is routinely offered this year (2016-17) to all children aged two, three and four years old, plus children in school years one, two and three.  In some areas all primary school children will be offered the vaccine. Over the next few years, the programme will be gradually extended to include children in other age groups. All children aged between six months and two years who are at risk of flu because of an underlying health condition are already eligible for the injected flu vaccine. Why aren''t children being given the injected flu vaccine instead of a nasal spray? The nasal spray flu vaccine is more effective than the injected flu vaccine, so it''s the preferred option. Will the flu vaccine give my child flu? No. The vaccine contains viruses that have been weakened to prevent them causing flu. Does the nasal vaccine contain pork? The nasal spray contains a highly processed form of gelatine derived from pigs. Although certified as acceptable by some faith groups, including representatives from Jewish and Muslim communities, there is considerable diversity in the Muslim community. Some scholars from the majority Hanafi community in England have stated that porcine gelatine is not permissible. Some parents may want to balance the constraints of their faith against the benefits of vaccination. Read more about the nasal spray vaccine and gelatine (PDF, 181kb). Can my child have the injected vaccine that doesn''t contain gelatine instead? The nasal vaccine offers the best protection for your child and it reduces the risk to others, including those too young to be vaccinated and those who may be more vulnerable to the complications of flu. The injected vaccine is not thought to reduce the spread as effectively, so it''s not being offered to healthy children as part of this programme. If your child is at high risk from flu as the result of one or more medical conditions or treatments and can''t have the nasal flu vaccine because of this, they should have the flu vaccine by injection.

But staying in work or returning to work might feel like a daunting prospect and you may find it helpful to take some time off or to ask your employer if you can work flexibly. The employment law rights that are particularly relevant to carers are: Right to request flexible working Time off for dependants Unpaid parental leave  Annual leave and pay Flexible working  One way to help juggle your responsibilities may be to request flexible working from your employer. Flexible working benefits you by giving you a better work-life balance while still being able to earn a living. Flexible working doesn''t necessarily mean part-time hours. You may be able to work the same number of hours but at times that suit you, such as evenings or weekends or work ‘compressed hours’ (for example, you work the equivalent of the hours you would normally work in five days over four days, giving you an extra day free). Other types of flexible working arrangements include: working from home ‘job sharing’ with someone else who wants to work part-time flexi-time (where you build up ‘credits’ by working extra hours when you can and then use this ‘credit’ to take time off later) only working during term times (if you need to be around for a child outside of school hours) working when the person that you normally care for is being cared for by someone else (for example, they may have activities outside of the home on some days) You can either make an informal request to work flexibly, for example, if it would help you to reduce your hours for a few weeks, or you can request flexible working under the new statutory scheme if you would like a permanent change to your terms and conditions of employment. Your right to request flexible working All employees with 26 weeks of service have a statutory right to request flexible working. The request must be made to your employer in writing and your employer must consider your request reasonably and have sound business reasons for turning down your request. You don’t have to tell your employer why you would like to work flexibly but you are more likely to identify a working arrangement that works for both you and your employer if your employer has this information. Before you apply for flexible working Before you speak to your employer, find out about their policy for supporting carers. You could do this by checking your staff handbook, intranet or speaking to your manager or Human Resources (HR) department. Making a flexible working request You are only legally entitled to make one application for flexible working each year. However, the company that you work for may be sympathetic if your situation changes and you need to make a second application. You must make your request in writing and date it. Your employer may have a standard form you can use. Tips for making your case include: Make it clear, in your request, that you''re a carer. Include information about the person who you care for – how you do this might help your case. State what changes you''d like to make to your working hours or working pattern, how you think it will affect your job and how any problems could be dealt with. Say when you would like your flexible working to start and whether you''ve made a similar request in the past, giving the date. It can take time for flexible working applications to be processed, so make the application as soon as possible. If your request is agreed to, it will permanently change your contract, and it may be difficult to change it back again. You could ask for flexible working arrangements on a trial basis to see whether they''re right for you. Why an employer can turn your request down Your employer has to have good business reasons for turning down a flexible working request. These count as business reasons: It will mean extra costs for the employer. It will make it difficult to meet customer demand. Your employer won’t be able to redistribute the work among the rest of the staff. Your employer can''t take on any more staff to cope with the extra work created by a change in your working patterns. The changes you have requested will have a negative impact on quality or performance at your workplace. There''s not enough work available at the times you''d like to work. Your employer already has structural changes planned. If your employer rejects your request, they have to tell you their business grounds for refusing your application (from the list above). Find out more about applying for flexible working on GOV.UK Acas also produces guidance on the right to request flexible working Preparing your request to work flexibly Being prepared could make all the difference. If you can show your employer how much their business could gain from flexible working, you stand a better chance of them agreeing to your request or, where they have not been able to agree to your request, turning their initial "No" into a "Yes". But you should also be willing to listen to your employer’s suggestions as you may be able to find a compromise that works for both of you. Make sure your request to work flexibly makes it clear why the particular arrangement that you have asked for would be helpful to you and outline the benefits of the proposed arrangement to your employer (or at least explain why you don’t think it would be detrimental to the business). Giving you the flexible working arrangement that you have requested could, for example, enable you to continue working or mean that you can do the same number of hours but at different times of the day or in a different place (if you have requested to work from home). Give your employer the facts about flexible working and carers, such as: Carers make up more than 12% of UK employees. More than 2 million people become carers each year. Flexible working can mean a variety of things, such as a change in hours, working from home regularly or occasionally, or term-time or part-time working. Explain to your employer the difference that flexible working can make to carers, such as: Flexible working allows carers to continue working and gives them vital social contact and friendship. Paid work gives carers financial independence and boosts self-esteem. People who juggle work and caring are committed to both. Any help they receive will be paid back with increased loyalty and effort. One working carer of elderly parents has said, “I personally go the extra mile for them because I appreciate what they’re doing for me.” Explain to your employer the business benefits of flexible working, such as: Flexible working can cut staff turnover, absences and employment costs. One national company believes: “Retaining carers through support or special leave arrangements saves the company about £1 million a year." Many carers are aged 45-64 years old, and these are employees at the peak of their careers. Being flexible about working hours on a daily basis often means that staff can look after the person they care for and still come to work. British Gas says: “The employee wins, the person who is being cared for wins, and the company wins as well.” Research by BT has discovered that their employees who worked flexibly showed an average increase in productivity of 21%. BT also says it made major savings through flexible working, including £1 billion in office costs and equipment. Flexible working can save 12 million litres of fuel a year. Reduced CO2 emissions and traffic make it a "green" choice. Research by Carers UK and the University of Leeds suggests that offering carers flexible ways of working brings greater productivity, improved company image and higher staff morale. Using these facts can help you make a strong argument in favour of being flexible. What if my employer refuses my request to work flexibly? If your employer will not agree to you working flexibly, you can challenge their decision. You might want to challenge the decision directly with your employer as a first option, as you may well be able to negotiate a good compromise. However, if you are still unsatisfied with the decision, you can suggest conciliation to your employer. Conciliation is a process which enables you and your employer to discuss options and hopefully find a compromise with the help of a third party. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) offers an early conciliation service.  You also have the option of taking your case to an Employment Tribunal but you will only be able to do this if you have first contacted Acas about early conciliation. Conciliation Acas and other organisations which provide mediation services can help to resolve differences between organisations and their staff. If you believe your employer has not understood the benefits of flexible working for you and the organisation or followed procedures properly (for instance, if they have based their decisions on incorrect facts), you could ask if they would agree to conciliation. This is a faster, less formal and less stressful process than an Employment Tribunal. If you are interested in conciliation you should contact Acas. If you decide to take your case to an Employment Tribunal you will need to contact Acas about conciliation first to enable you to make a claim.  Time off for dependants Employees have the right to take unpaid time off for certain emergencies (also known as ‘time off for dependants''). You have this right no matter how long you’ve worked for your employer. Everyone has to cope with emergencies from time to time. As a carer, you may be more likely to have sudden emergencies to deal with. You are entitled to ‘reasonable time off work’ for emergencies involving the person that you care for where they live in the same household as you and/or the cared for person reasonably relies on you to make arrangements to care for them. The right is to unpaid leave only, but your employer may choose to pay you during the time that you are off work. You should, therefore, check your contract or company policy to see if your employer will pay you for this time off, but if they don’t have a specific policy this decision is up to them. Who is a ‘dependant’? A dependant can be your mother or father, your son or daughter, or anybody who lives with you as a member of your family and is dependent on you. A dependant can also be someone who would rely on your help in an emergency, such as an elderly neighbour who lives alone. What counts as an emergency? There are a number of situations that count as an emergency. Examples are: When your care arrangements are temporarily disrupted (such as when a nurse doesn’t arrive), or break down completely. When someone you''re looking after dies and you need to make arrangements or go to the funeral. When someone you''re looking after is ill or has been assaulted (for example, has been mugged, or your child has been in a fight). When you need to make arrangements for the long-term care of someone you''re looking after who is ill or injured (but this does not include giving them long-term care yourself). Your rights allow for a ''reasonable'' amount of time off. Each case is different, but in most cases, one or two days may be enough. There is no set limit on how often you can claim time off for dependants, as long as you are dealing with real emergencies. If your employer feels that you are taking more time off than they can cope with, they need to let you know. If the problem takes longer to deal with, let your employer know as soon as you can, explaining why you need more time and how much longer you think you will need. Put this in writing if you can. Your employer may have a form for you to fill in. Having the right to take time off for dependants can give you some legal protection. If you think your employer has treated you unfairly because you have taken time off to deal with an emergency or to help a dependant, ask your union or a legal adviser for advice. Unpaid parental leave Parents and other employees with parental responsibility can take up to 18 weeks unpaid parental leave for each of their children under five years old. The government is extending the qualifying age for children and from April 2015 you will be able to take unpaid parental leave if you have parental responsibility for a child under the age of 18. You are able to take up to four weeks unpaid parental leave in any year (more if your employer agrees to this). Annual leave and pay All employees are entitled to a minimum of 28 days paid annual leave per year (pro-rated for part-time workers). An employer can choose to include bank holidays as part of a worker’s statutory annual leave. Other ways your employer can help In addition to flexible working, other ways your employer can help include: discretionary unpaid and paid leave granting a career break Discretionary unpaid and paid leave As well as your statutory right to take time off in an emergency, your employer may allow you extra time off, either paid or unpaid. This is sometimes referred to as ‘special leave’ or ‘compassionate leave’. There is no statutory entitlement to this leave, but you may have a right to it under your employment contract or it may be something that your employer agrees to on an ‘ad hoc’ basis. Compassionate leave can help when you need to look after the person in your care for a longer period of time, such as when they come out of hospital.  Granting a career break If working and caring become too difficult and you are thinking about giving up work, ask about a career break or ‘sabbatical’. Some employers offer paid or unpaid career breaks, so it is worth checking. It would mean you could concentrate on your caring role for a while, knowing that you have your job to go back to. If you are on an unpaid career break, you may also be entitled to Carer’s Allowance during this time even if your salary is usually above the threshold, because your eligibility for Carer’s Allowance is assessed based on your weekly net income. However, once your circumstances have changed and you return to work, you will need to notify the Department of Work and Pensions about a change in your circumstances.

(115, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/mmr-vaccine.aspx', 'MMR vaccine', 'About the MMR vaccine - Vaccinations - NHS Choices', '', 'MMR is a safe and effective combined vaccine that protects against three separate illnesses – measles, mumps and rubella (German measles) – in a single injection. The full course of MMR vaccination requires two doses. Measles, mumps and rubella are highly infectious conditions that can have serious, and potentially fatal, complications, including meningitis, swelling of the brain (encephalitis) and deafness. They can also lead to complications in pregnancy that affect the unborn baby, and can lead to miscarriage.  Since the MMR vaccine was introduced in 1988, it''s rare for children in the UK to develop these serious conditions. However, outbreaks happen and there have been cases of measles in recent years, so it''s important to ensure that you and your children are up-to-date with the MMR vaccination. This NHS leaflet tells you about MMR vaccination. MMR vaccine for babies and preschoolers The MMR vaccine is given on the NHS as a single injection to babies as part of their routine vaccination schedule, usually within a month of their first birthday. They will then have a second injection of the vaccine before starting school, usually at three years and four months. The MMR vaccine can sometimes be given to babies from six months of age if they may have been exposed to the measles virus, or during a measles outbreak.   Babies under six months old are not routinely given the MMR vaccine. This is because the antibodies to measles, mumps and rubella passed from mother to baby at the time of birth are retained and can work against the vaccine, meaning that the vaccine is not usually effective. These maternal antibodies decline with age and are almost all gone by the time MMR is normally given – around the age of one. MMR vaccination is recommended for six- to nine-month-old babies if they are at high risk of becoming infected in certain circumstances, such as during a measles outbreak. However, these children may not have enough protection from this early dose, so they will still need the standard MMR doses at 12-13 months and 40 months of age. The MMR vaccine is given as a single injection into the muscle of the thigh or upper arm. Find out which children and adults should have the MMR vaccine. Watch these healthtalk.org videos where parents weigh up the risks and benefits of MMR vaccination. MMR for older children Children up to the age of 18 who missed, or only partially completed, their earlier MMR vaccination can have a "catch-up" MMR vaccination on the NHS.   If you know or suspect your child hasn''t been fully immunised, arrange with your GP for them to have a catch-up MMR vaccination. MMR for women planning pregnancy If you''re thinking about getting pregnant, it''s a good idea to check that you are fully protected against measles, mumps and rubella. Rubella infection in pregnancy can lead to serious birth defects and miscarriage. If you''re not sure whether you''ve had two doses of the MMR vaccine, ask your GP practice to check.  If you haven''t had both doses or there''s no record available, you can have the vaccinations at your GP practice. You should avoid becoming pregnant for one month after having MMR vaccination. Be aware that the MMR vaccine is not suitable for women who are already pregnant. MMR for non-immune adults The MMR vaccine can also be given on the NHS to adults who may need it, including people born from 1970-79 who may have only been vaccinated against measles, as well as those born from 1980-90 who may not be protected against mumps. Check with your GP if you''re not sure whether you''ve had the MMR vaccine. If in doubt, go ahead and have it. Even if you''ve had it before, it won''t harm you to have a second, or even third, course of the vaccination. Read more about when the MMR vaccine is needed. Find out why some teenagers should have the MMR vaccination. Get advice on how to protect yourself and your family if there''s a measles outbreak. Read the NHS leaflet: measles not just a kids'' problem (PDF, 868kb) How the MMR vaccine works The MMR vaccine contains weakened versions of live measles, mumps and rubella viruses. The vaccine works by triggering the immune system to produce antibodies against measles, mumps and rubella. If you or your child then comes into contact with one of the diseases, the immune system will recognise it and immediately produce the antibodies needed to fight it. It''s not possible for people who have recently had the MMR vaccine to infect other people. The MMR vaccine given in the UK is known under the brand names Priorix, or M-M-RVAXPRO. Read the patient information leaflet for Priorix (PDF, 124kb). Read the patient information leaflet for M-M-RVAXPRO (PDF, 104kb). Does the MMR vaccine cause autism? There has been some controversy about whether the MMR vaccine might cause autism, following a 1998 study by Dr Andrew Wakefield. In his paper, published in The Lancet, Dr Wakefield claimed there is a link between the MMR vaccine and autism or bowel disease. However, Andrew Wakefield''s work has since been completely discredited and he has been struck off as a doctor in the UK. Subsequent studies in the last eight years have found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism or bowel disease. Watch healthtalk.org videos where parents discuss their worries about the MMR vaccine. Single measles, mumps and rubella vaccines Single vaccines are not available on the NHS in the UK because there is a risk that fewer children would receive all the necessary injections, increasing the levels of measles, mumps and rubella in the country. The delay in having six separate injections would also put more children at risk of developing the conditions, as well as increasing the amount of work and inconvenience for parents and those administering the vaccines.  Side effects of the MMR vaccine As there are three separate vaccines within a single injection, different side effects can occur at different times. The side effects of the MMR vaccine are usually mild. It''s important to remember that they''re milder than the potential complications of measles, mumps and rubella. Side effects include: developing a mild form of measles that lasts for two to three days – this is not infectious  developing a mild form of mumps that lasts for a day or two – this is not infectious In rare cases, a small rash of bruise-like spots may appear a few weeks after the injection. See your GP if you notice this kind of rash, or if you have any concerns about your child''s symptoms after having the MMR jab. Find out how the MMR jab is given. This NHS leaflet tells you about the common vaccination reactions in babies and young children up to the age of five years. Read the answers to other common questions about the MMR vaccine.

Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you''re depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They''re wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression isn''t a sign of weakness or something you can "snap out of" by "pulling yourself together". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. How to tell if you have depression Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety. There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, unhappiness or anxiety during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. Read more about low mood and depression. If you''ve been feeling low for more than a few days, take this short test to find out if you''re depressed. When to see a doctor It''s important to seek help from your GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it''s best not to delay.

Sometimes there''s a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or even having a baby, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Read more about the causes of depression. Depression is fairly common, affecting about one in 10 people at some point during their life. It affects men and women, young and old. Studies have shown that about 4% of children aged five to 16 in the UK are anxious or depressed. Treating depression Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medication. Your recommended treatment will be based on whether you have mild, moderate or severe depression. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as "watchful waiting". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and self-help groups. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), are often used for mild depression that isn''t improving or moderate depression. Antidepressants are also sometimes prescribed. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medication. Read more about treating depression. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of the treatments for depression. Living with depression Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise, cutting down on alcohol, giving up smoking and eating healthily. Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Read more about the lifestyle changes you can make to help you beat depression.

(117, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/tax-credits.aspx', 'Tax credits', 'Tax credits - Care and support guide - NHS Choices', '', 'Tax credits can help you if you’re paying tax but don’t earn a lot of money. Who is eligible for Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit? You may be eligible for one of these credits if any of the following apply: If you’re in work, you could be eligible for Working Tax Credit. If you’re disabled, you may be able to get more Working Tax Credit.  If you have children, you could be eligible for Child Tax Credit. If you are the parent of a disabled child, you may be eligible for a higher rate of Child Tax Credit. To get tax credits, you generally have to be present in Great Britain and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom. Child Tax Credit and disability If you are the parent of disabled children, you can also claim a “disabled child element” for each child who gets Disability Living Allowance (DLA) or Personal Independence Payment (PIP) at any level, or who is registered blind. This will be increased to a “severely disabled child element” if they get DLA at the highest rate for care, or PIP at the enhanced daily living component. Working Tax Credit and disability A disability element can be added if you''re a disabled worker. If two members of a couple qualify, two disability elements are payable. This can be increased to a severe disability element if you (or your partner) get DLA at the highest rate for the personal care component. If two members of a couple qualify, two severe disability elements are payable. If you’re already claiming tax credits and your condition changes, you’ll need to talk to HMRC about whether you’ll get more (or less) tax credits. More information about tax credits You can find out the basics about tax credits, including whether you’re eligible and how much you might get, at GOV.UK: Working Tax Credit and GOV.UK: Child Tax Credit. Alternatively, call the Tax Credit Helpline on 0345 300 3900 (textphone 0345 300 3909) to claim or to talk through whether you might be eligible. These are also the numbers for any complaints about tax credits. Don’t forget, if you do claim tax credits, you’ll need to renew your tax credit claim each year (by July 31).

In fact, there’s a wide variety of social care services available and most people will be able to have care provided in their home. The kind of social care support you can get depends largely on your needs. This means the type of condition you have, or the severity of your disability. For example, if you have trouble walking, you may simply require some equipment to help you remain mobile and independent. But if you develop a condition that seriously affects your mental capacity or your ability to move and look after yourself, you are likely to need a much wider range of social care services. It is worth taking time to think about your specific needs and what you think you might need to help you achieve the best quality of life you can. Care and support services might typically include: equipment help in your home  community support and activities day centres home adaptations residential care financial support information and advisory services, and advocacy support for carers other care support Equipment to enhance your independence The ability for you to remain independent sometimes hinges on small factors and tools, such as a jar gripper (to help you remove lids) or ways to raise your seat (so that you can get up more easily). Equipment can also help with weightier issues, for example, hoists to help people with mobility problems get on and off chairs or toilets, or in and out of the bath or bed. The equipment you may be able to access could include monitoring devices that check whether you have left the house if you have a condition, such as dementia, that causes confusion and wandering. Find out more in alarms and telecare. Help in your home You may want to have someone who can come to your home and give you the support you need to live your life. This can include help with tasks such as getting dressed, help with using the toilet, washing, preparing and eating food, cleaning and laundry, getting out and about, and taking part in leisure and social activities. Find out more about homecare. The Money Advice Service has a useful guide to employing a personal assistant. If you are unable to manage in your home, even with help and assistance, you may need to consider whether you should move to a care or nursing home. Your local authority will be able to provide you with information and advice on what services are available in your local area. Community support and activities Some social care services can be provided to help you continue to play an active role in your community and to get out and about and do the things you want to do. For example, you may want to work or to partake in religious or cultural events such as a festival or a sports match. Social care services may be able to support you in a wide range of ways to enable you to continue to do these things, for example a community transport service. Your local authority will be able to provide you with information and advice on what services are available in your local area.   Day centres Day centres provide meals and an opportunity to socialise and do activities that might not be available at home and may provide respite for family carers. Your local authority will be able to provide you with information and advice on what services are available in your local area. Adaptations to your home A common way that social care can support ill or disabled people to live independently at home is simple adaptations to the home. If you have difficulty living at home because of your condition, it is often a better option to improve your home than to move somewhere new. For example, depending on your condition, you might be able to get lowered kitchen surfaces and storage, wider doorways to accommodate wheelchairs or walking frames, or improved flooring to prevent trips and falls. Your local authority will be able to provide you with information and advice on what services are available in your local area. Residential care If living at home is no longer a realistic or practical option, you may want to consider residential care. There are many different types of ‘residential care’ – it may mean a permanent move into a care home for older people, or it could be a stay in a home for younger adults with disabilities, or a home for children. Residential care may be privately owned, or run by a charity or the local authority. The main types of residential options are: residential care homes residential care homes with nursing care  extra care and sheltered housing supported living  retirement villages  Deciding on a long-term stay in residential care is a significant decision financially, practically and emotionally. You will need to think about your own preferences and decide what services will meet your needs now, as well as being flexible enough to take account of your future care needs. It is not always an easy decision. Independent advice can be important in helping you make the right decision, taking into account all the important factors. Your local authority will be able to give you details of information services they commission locally. Many local and national charities will also be able to provide information and advice. Financial support If you are in need of social care you may be able to get information and advice on how to cover the additional living costs you may incur. For example, you may be able to access certain financial benefits for daily living, or be able to access funding from charities to cover the costs of expensive equipment. Your local authority should be able to talk you through some of these money matters as part of your social care assessment. Find out more about how to fund care. Information and advisory services, and advocacy People who need care may have difficulty in being able to exert their rights, get the services they need and are entitled to, or simply not know or understand what is available to them. Information and advice are often a key part of any care assessment that your local authority undertakes. This information could go a long way to helping you get the support you need. Charities are another great source of social care information – particularly those associated with conditions, such as the Alzheimer’s Society, Mind, or Scope, but also those related to different aspects of care, such as Carers UK or Independent Age. Some people may find that an advocacy service can help them exert their rights, particularly if you have a disability and you believe you are treated unfairly. An advocacy service can act as a champion to ensure you get fair and equal treatment and access to services. Find out more about advocacy. Support for carers If you look after a person who is disabled, has a long-term health condition or is elderly and frail, you are a carer. Carers can get help with their caring role, and by enabling the person they care for to get the support they need, they can make their own life easier. For example, it’s important that carers have time for themselves, and one of the best ways to arrange breaks from caring is to ensure that you have had a carer’s assessment. This will help identify how substantial and demanding your caring is and how much support you are likely to need. Other care support You may also want to think about whether you need healthcare support if you have care needs relating to an ongoing health condition. If this is the case, then it is worth considering whether the NHS can offer any treatment, medical equipment or support that can help you live more fully with your condition. Read more about NHS continuing care. If you are looking after a child with a disability, you should also consider the support that your child will need with their education. Again, talk to your local authority to discuss the types of support you might be able to get.

Home care Media last reviewed: 30/09/2015 Next review due: 30/09/2017 If you need help around the home, a good option is to have a care worker come in to your home to help you. Types of homecare Homecare comes in many forms and has many names used to describe it, including home help, care attendants and "carers" (not to be confused with unpaid family or friends who care for you). Homecare can suit you if you need: personal care, such as washing or dressing housekeeping or domestic work, such as vacuuming cooking or preparing meals nursing and health care companionship Homecare can be very flexible, in order to meet your needs, and the same person or agency may be able to provide some or all of these options for the duration of your care: long-term 24-hour care short breaks for an unpaid family carer emergency care  day care sessions ranging from 15-minute visits to 24-hour assistance and everything in between If you already know what you want, you can search NHS Choices directories for: local homecare services and agencies a list of national homecare organisations services that can help you stay safe and well in your home on a long-term basis; these services, often known as "supported living services", can include financial, help with medication, advocacy, social and practical support a place to live in a family who will care for you, known as "shared lives services" or adult placement services If you believe that you might benefit from some help at home, the first thing to do is to contact your social services department to ask for an assessment of your care and support needs. To contact social services, go to GOV.UK: find your local authority. If you are eligible for homecare services, the local authority may provide or arrange the help themselves. Alternatively, you can arrange your own care, funded by the local authority, through direct payments or a personal budget. If you have chosen direct payments or a personal budget, or you aren’t eligible for local authority help and want to get care privately, you can arrange it in several different ways. Independent homecare agencies If you use an independent homecare agency, you or the person you''re looking after has to find the care agency and pay them. The agency will provide a service through a trained team of care workers, which means you may not always have the same person visiting your home, although the agency will do its best to take your choices into account. Independent homecare providers are regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Homecare agencies must meet CQC’s national minimum standards and regulations in areas such as training and record-keeping. The CQC has the power to inspect agencies and enforce standards. Homecare agencies must vet homecare workers before engaging them by taking up references and carrying out Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks on potential employees. Homecare agencies can also: take over the burden of being an employer – for example, payroll, training, disciplinary issues and insurance   train their homecare workers through national qualifications and service-specific training replace workers when they are ill, on holiday or resign put things right when they go wrong An agency will want to see you and the person you''re looking after so that they can assess your needs. This also means that a joint decision can be made about the most appropriate type of care and support. You can find out more from the UK Homecare Association. What are the disadvantages of using a homecare agency? The main disadvantage is the cost of using an agency. The agency will charge a fee on top of the payment made to the care worker to cover their running costs and profit. You normally have to make a regular payment to the agency, which includes both the worker’s earnings and the agency’s fee. Questions to ask when using a homecare agency The fees some agencies charge can be quite high. Before deciding to go ahead with an agency, you should ask questions about the fee and what it covers, including: Does the agency check references?  What training and supervision do they provide?  What is their complaints policy?  Who will be responsible for insurance?  Is there any out-of-hours or emergency contact if needed?  Will they be able to provide staff if your own care worker is ill or away? (If an agency contracts to provide care every day, it must ensure that it does.)  Hiring a personal assistant You can hire a "personal assistant" to act as a homecare worker for you. Personal assistants can offer you all that you’ll get from an agency worker, but you’ll also get the continuity, familiarity and ongoing relationship with your assistant. However, if you employ a personal assistant, you will then have the legal responsibility of an employer. This will include arranging cover for their illness and holidays. GOV.UK has more information on becoming an employer, while Which? Elderly Care also has advice on employing private individuals. Homecare from charities Charities such as Age UK and Carers Trust can provide home help and domestic assistance services. The Carers Trust supports carers by giving them a break from their caring responsibilities through homecare services. Marie Curie Nurses can provide practical and emotional support for people near the end of their lives in their own homes. Safeguarding vulnerable groups The DBS makes decisions about who is unsuitable to work or volunteer with vulnerable adults or children. It makes this decision based on information held by various agencies and government departments. The service decides who is unsuitable to work or volunteer with vulnerable adults or children.  If someone who is barred from working with children or vulnerable adults is working, volunteering or trying to work or volunteer with these groups, they are breaking the law. They could face a fine and up to five years in prison.  Employers must apply for an enhanced DBS check (formerly known as a CRB check) when taking on new employees or volunteers to work with vulnerable adults or children. This includes a check of the barred lists. If an organisation fails to make the relevant checks, they can be penalised. If an organisation dismisses an employee or volunteer for harming a child or vulnerable adult, they must tell the DBS. The DBS must also be notified if any employee or volunteer harms a child or vulnerable adult, but isn''t dismissed because they leave voluntarily. If their organisation does not tell DBS, they will be acting illegally. Questions can be answered by the DBS call centre on 0870 909 0811, or by email. Employing a care worker on a private basis If you employ a care worker privately, you will not be obliged to use the DBS scheme, but you can use it if you choose to. You need to ask social services or the police to make the checks on your behalf. The care worker must have already applied to be vetted, and must consent to the check. If you have concerns about the suitability of someone you employ privately to work with a vulnerable adult or child, you can ask social services to investigate the matter. They can refer the worker to the ISA on your behalf. Manual handling If you need help to move, or you need someone to lift you (such as getting out of bed or getting on to the toilet), this can put the person doing the lifting at risk of injury. This "manual handling" can result in back pain and in the most serious cases, permanent disability if not done correctly. The law says that employers must take reasonable precautions to ensure their employees don''t do any manual handling that carries a risk of them being injured. This applies to you if you directly employ a personal assistant to care for you (but most likely will not if you hire someone through an agency). It is particularly important to consider insurance in this situation. This would cover any risk of the care worker injuring themselves, as well as any risk of them causing an injury. There are rules around the risk assessments you need to carry out, and the Health and Safety Executive produces advice on safe manual handling (PDF, 443kb).

The changes in the Care Act are designed to put you in control of the help you receive. Any decisions about your care and support will consider your wellbeing and what is important to you and your family, so you can stay healthy and remain independent for longer. The Act includes a ''wellbeing principle'' to underpin the care and support system. This means that your wellbeing, and the outcomes which matter to you, should be at the heart of every decision that is made about your care and support. The Act also includes a duty for local authorities to provide or arrange services that help prevent people in their area from developing needs for care and support, or that delay the impact of their needs.  Local authorities now need to ensure that people can get the information and advice they need to make good decisions about care and support, and that they are able to choose from a range of care and support providers offering a choice of high-quality, appropriate services. Councils'' new duty to promote people''s wellbeing applies not just to users of services, but also to carers. The Children and Families Act 2014 includes a duty to assess parent carers.

The law makes clear that local authorities must provide or arrange services that help prevent people developing needs for care and support or delay people getting to the point where they would need ongoing care and support. Local authorities have to consider: what services, facilities and resources are already available in the area (for example, local voluntary and community groups), and how these might help local people which people in their area might have care and support needs that are not being met which carers in the area might have support needs that are not being met Local authorities have to work with people in their communities to provide or arrange services that help to keep people well and independent. This should include identifying the local support and resources already available, and how people can be helped to access them. Local authorities should also provide or arrange a range of services that are aimed at reducing needs and helping people regain skills – for instance, after a spell in hospital. Providing information and advice As a result of the Care Act 2014, local authorities have to provide comprehensive information and advice about care and support services in their local area. This should help people understand how care and support services work locally, the care and funding options available, and how people can access care and support services. They have a duty to provide information on: the types of care and support available – such as specialised dementia care, befriending services, personal assistance, residential care – and the local providers the process people need to use to get the available care and support  where people can find independent financial advice about care and support and how they can access it, so they can get support to plan and prepare for the future costs of care how people can raise concerns about the safety or wellbeing of someone who has care and support needs This information and advice has to be provided in formats that help people to understand, regardless of their needs. Improving the range and quality of services available The Act requires local authorities to work to ensure that people can choose from a wide range of sustainable, high-quality care and support services that will be available locally. This will mean that people can make choices about their care and can have personalised care that works for them. Find out more in Your right to social care and support. The Act requires local authorities to enable people to be able to choose from a wide range of sustainable, high-quality care and support services, which will be available locally. When buying and arranging services, local authorities have to consider how they might affect your wellbeing. This includes planning the services that are likely to be needed in the future, and what new types of support may need to be developed. As part of this, local authorities should engage with local people about their wants and needs.

(123, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Travel-immunisation/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Travel vaccines', 'Travel vaccinations - NHS Choices', 'Travel vaccinations  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  If you''re planning to travel outside the UK, you may need to be vaccinated against some of the serious diseases found in other parts of the world. Vaccinations are available to protect you against infections such as yellow fever, typhoid and hepatitis A. In the UK, the childhood vaccination programme protects you against a number of diseases, but doesn''t cover most of the infectious diseases found overseas. Which jabs do I need? You can find out which vaccinations are necessary or recommended for the areas you''ll be visiting on these two websites: NHS fitfortravel the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) Some countries require you to have an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP) before you enter. For example, Saudi Arabia requires proof of vaccination against certain types of meningitis for visitors arriving for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. Many tropical countries in Africa and South America won''t accept travellers from an area where there''s yellow fever unless they can prove they''ve been vaccinated against it. Read more about the vaccines available for travellers abroad. Where do I get my jabs? You should get advice at least eight weeks before you''re due to travel, as some jabs need to be given well in advance. First, phone or visit your GP or practice nurse to find out whether your existing UK jabs are up-to-date (they can tell from your notes). Your GP or practice nurse may also be able to give you general advice about travel vaccinations and travel health, such as protecting yourself from malaria. Your GP or practice nurse can give you a booster of your UK jabs if you need one. They may be able to give you the travel jabs you need, either free on the NHS or for a charge. Alternatively, you can visit a local private travel vaccination clinic for your UK boosters and other travel jabs. Not all vaccinations are available free on the NHS, even if they''re recommended for travel to a certain area. Free travel vaccinations The following travel vaccinations are usually available free on the NHS: diphtheria, polio and tetanus (combined booster) typhoid hepatitis A – including when combined with typhoid or hepatitis B cholera These vaccines are usually free because they protect against diseases thought to represent the greatest risk to public health if they were brought into the country. Private travel vaccinations You''re likely to have to pay for travel vaccinations against: hepatitis B when not combined with hepatitis A Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis meningitis vaccines  rabies tuberculosis (TB) yellow fever Yellow fever vaccines are only available from designated centres. The NaTHNaC website can help you find a clinic offering yellow fever vaccination. The cost of travel vaccines at private clinics will vary, but could be around £50 for each dose of a vaccine. It''s worth considering this when budgeting for your trip. Things to consider There are several things to consider when planning your travel vaccinations, including: the country or countries you''re visiting – some diseases are more common in certain parts of the world and less common in others  when you''re travelling – some diseases are more common at certain times of the year; for example, during the rainy season where you''re staying – in general, you''ll be more at risk of disease in rural areas than in urban areas, and if you''re backpacking and staying in hostels or camping, you may be more at risk than if you were on a package holiday and staying in a hotel how long you''ll be staying – the longer your stay, the greater your risk of being exposed to diseases your age and health – some people may be more vulnerable to infection than others, while some vaccinations can''t be given to people with certain medical conditions what you''ll be doing during your stay – for example, whether you''ll be spending a lot of time outdoors, such as trekking or working in rural areas if you''re working as an aid worker – you may come into contact with more diseases if you''re working in a refugee camp or helping after a natural disaster if you''re working in a medical setting – for example, a doctor or nurse may require additional vaccinations if you are in contact with animals – in this case, you may be more at risk of getting diseases spread by animals, such as rabies If you''re only travelling to countries in northern and central Europe, North America or Australia, you''re unlikely to need any vaccinations. If possible, see your GP at least eight weeks before you''re due to travel. Some vaccinations need to be given well in advance to allow your body to develop immunity. Some also involve multiple doses spread over several weeks. Pregnancy and breastfeeding Speak to your GP before having any vaccinations if: you''re pregnant you think you might be pregnant you''re breastfeeding In many cases, it''s unlikely a vaccine given while pregnant or breastfeeding will cause problems for the baby. However, your GP will be able to give you further advice about this. People with immune deficiencies For some people travelling overseas, vaccination against certain diseases may not be advised. This may be the case if: you have a condition that affects your body''s immune system, such as HIV or AIDS you''re receiving treatment that affects your immune system, such as chemotherapy you''ve recently had a bone marrow or organ transplant Your GP can give you further advice about this. Non-travel vaccines As well as getting any travel vaccinations you need, it''s also a good opportunity to make sure your other vaccinations are up-to-date and have booster jabs if necessary. Your GP surgery can check your existing vaccination records. People in certain risk groups may be offered extra vaccines. These include vaccinations against diseases such as hepatitis B, tuberculosis (TB), flu and chickenpox.

(124, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/personalisation.aspx', 'What is personalisation?', 'Personalised care and support - Care and support guide - NHS Choices', '', 'If your local authority agrees to pay for some or all of your home care needs, it must offer you choice over how to meet your needs – this is known as personalisation of your care and support. A good assessment of your needs will help you begin to think about the kinds of things you may want to do to meet you care and support needs. Following this, you will be involved in planning out how you would like to meet your needs, and be given a personal budget, and can choose to take a direct payment. Self-directed support through good planning, personal budgets and direct payments is often called "personalised support" or "personalisation". It gives you choice and control over how your needs are met, and enables you to do the things you value the most. Personal budgets A personal budget is the amount of money the local authority allocates for your care, based on its assessment of your needs. You can be put in charge of this "budget" either by telling the local authority how you would like it spent, or by the council giving you the money so that you can directly pay for your own care (a direct payment). It could also be given to a separate organisation (such as a user-controlled trust) that will spend the money on your care as you see fit, if you prefer. These are commonly known as Individual Service Funds. Additionally, you can choose a combination of the above (for example, a direct payment with some council-arranged care and support), often called a mixed package. Direct payments Direct payments give you the most control over your care, and mean that if you are unhappy with the services you’re getting, you can decide to change who gives you the care services without the process of going through the local authority. However, with this freedom comes the responsibility of accounting for how the budget is spent to ensure it is meeting your needs, and additional responsibilities if you decide to become an employer and hire a personal assistant with your direct payment. The Money Advice Service has a guide to using direct payments. What does personalised support mean for me? Personalisation means that you will have to spend some time and effort thinking about your care and support needs, the outcomes you wish to achieve, and how you may want to meet your needs. Depending on the choices you make, there may be some additional responsibilities. For example, if you decide to request a direct payment to cover the cost of homecare, you could use the payment to hire an individual, giving you the responsibilities of an employer. Alternatively, you could hire careworkers through an agency, which removes the legal obligations of being employer, but may potentially adds cost and may remove some of the benefits of having the same person provide your care. Read more about how to choose care services. How does personalised care and support work? You and your social worker or care manager will work together to create a care and support plan. This plan details your care and support needs, and will be used to work out the value of your "personal budget". Your support plan should consider:  what''s important to you, including your interests, lifestyle, personal tastes and the people in your life   your hopes for the future, such as whether you''d like to study or take on more hobbies outside the home   what limitations you currently have and how you want to change  what you want to achieve by managing your own support Ensure that you include information about how you''ll manage your money and what you''ll spend the money on (including personal assistants, transport, housing adaptations, therapists and respite services). You will need to clarify how you will manage your money. If you choose to receive your personal budget as a direct payment, the local authority may pay the money straight into a bank account that you control (you must set up a new bank account to do this) or they may give you a pre-paid card. Alternatively, you may prefer your personal budget to be managed by the local authority or by someone else, such as: a friend or family member (the local authority must agree to this) a broker, independent social worker or an advocate  your care manager or social worker Discuss these options with your social worker or carer and consider which option is best for you. If someone else will be looking after your money, you may need to create a "decision-making agreement". A decision-making agreement should state how they will look after your money and what decisions they can and can’t make on your behalf. The local authority may want to check what you do with your money, to make sure you’re spending your budget appropriately and that your care and support needs are being met. You may need to keep receipts where possible (especially for large purchases), so that you can show them you''ve spent your money responsibly. If you choose a direct payment, the council will give you a direct payment agreement that will set out the terms and conditions. If you''re struggling to manage your money, the local authority should advise you on how to make your money work best for you. Checking your care plan is meeting your care and support needs You should meet with your local authority at least once a year to discuss whether your care plan is working. This is an opportunity to discuss whether your needs are being met in the best way, and it''s also your chance to talk about changes you want to make for the future. You don’t have to wait for a review meeting to change the way in which you spend your budget. You can change things as you go along. If you want to make a big change, consult your care manager or social worker, who may arrange a review. You can ask for a review meeting about your care plan at any time. To prepare for a review, you should provide any receipts you''ve kept since you were awarded a personal budget. If someone is managing your funds for you, get them to join the review meeting. Disagreements about care plans and personal budgets If you''ve been informed that you''re not eligible for services, or you don’t agree with the amount allocated to you in your personal budget, you can request a reassessment. Speak to your social worker or care manager about being reassessed, or phone your local authority social services department and request a complaints form.

Your doctor’s surgery or clinic will automatically send you an appointment for you to bring your baby for their vaccination. Most surgeries and health centres run special immunisation or baby clinics. If you can’t get to the clinic, contact your surgery to make another appointment. All childhood vaccinations are free. Read this NHS guide to the complete immunisation schedule. Do babies need to be vaccinated before going swimming? You can take your baby swimming at any time before and after their immunisations. Can I refuse my baby’s vaccinations? As a parent, you can refuse any of your child''s recommended vaccinations. You should be asked for your consent before each vaccination and, if you refuse, this will be recorded in your child’s medical notes. Bear in mind that there''s lots of evidence that vaccinations do much more good than harm, and that vaccines will protect your child for many years against a range of serious illnesses. Read more about weighing up the benefits and risks of vaccination. If my child misses a vaccination, can they still continue the course? If you missed the appointment or delayed the immunisation, make a new appointment as soon as possible. You can usually (though not always) pick up the immunisation schedule where it stopped without having to start again. Read more about vaccination appointments. Will my baby have side effects from vaccination? Some babies will have side effects, but they''re generally mild and short-lived. These include: redness, swelling or tenderness where they had the injection (this will slowly disappear on its own) a bit of irritability and feeling unwell  a high temperature (fever) If your baby develops a fever, you can treat them with paracetamol or ibuprofen.  This NHS leaflet tells you about common side effects of vaccinations in babies and children up to five years of age. Read more about the potential side effects of vaccinations. Will the vaccination hurt my baby? Your baby may cry and be upset for a few minutes, but they’ll usually settle down after a cuddle. Read six practical vaccination tips for parents. Can babies with an allergy have vaccinations? Asthma, eczema, food intolerances and allergies do NOT prevent your child having any of their vaccinations. If you have any questions, speak to your doctor, practice nurse or health visitor. Read the myths and truths about vaccinations. Could my baby have an allergic reaction to a vaccine? It’s very rare for babies to have an allergic reaction to a vaccination – but it can happen. The important thing to remember is that it’s completely treatable. Signs of an allergic reaction to a vaccination are a rash or itching of part or all of the body. If this happens, the doctor or nurse giving the vaccine will know how to treat it. In very rare cases, children can have a severe reaction within a few minutes of the injection, which causes breathing difficulties and, sometimes, they can collapse. This is called an anaphylactic reaction. Anaphylactic reaction only happens about once in every million immunisations. Again, the people who give vaccinations are trained to deal with anaphylactic reactions on the spot and children recover completely with treatment. Read more about the safety of vaccinations and why there is no limit on the number of vaccinations your baby or child can have. If my baby is ill, should I postpone their vaccination? If your baby has a minor illness without a fever, such as a cold, they can have their vaccinations as normal. If your baby is ill with a fever, put off the vaccination until they have recovered. If your baby has either: a bleeding disorder (such as haemophilia) a fit not associated with fever speak to your doctor, practice nurse or health visitor before your child has any immunisations. Read more about why and when your baby should avoid having a vaccination. My baby was premature - should they wait until they''re older for their routine vaccinations? Premature babies may be at higher risk of catching infections, so it’s really important that they have their vaccinations on time, i.e. from eight weeks of age, no matter how premature they were. It may seem very early to give a vaccination to such a tiny baby, but many scientific studies have shown that it’s a good time to give them vaccines. Postponing vaccination until they''re older leaves premature babies vulnerable to diseases. Read more about when to vaccinate your baby.

Your National Insurance (NI) number is the number used to keep track of your NI contributions and your entitlement to benefits. Your NI record, kept by Her Majesty''s Revenue and Customs (HRMC), will determine your entitlement to many social security benefits. These include: State Pension contribution-based Jobseeker''s Allowance contribution-based Incapacity Benefit contributory Employment and Support Allowance bereavement benefits To be entitled to one of these "contribution-based" benefits, you have to satisfy two contribution conditions (except for bereavement benefits). The first contribution condition is that you have to have paid enough NI contributions in one or more past tax years (the tax year runs from April 6 to April 5 the following year). The second contribution condition is that you have paid, are paying, or have been credited with enough NI contributions in the last two tax years before your claim for the benefit. National Insurance contributions and credits The NI record is built up from either actual contributions or contributions that are credited, or a combination of the two. Contributions may be deductions from earnings while you are in paid employment. The deductions are made between the age of 16 and State Pension age if you earn more than a certain amount of money. State Pension age is 65 for men. Between 2010 and 2020, the State Pension age for women will gradually rise from 60 to 65. There are different classes of contribution depending on whether, for example, the contributions are made by the employee or employer, or by a person who is self-employed. Different classes of contribution give entitlement to different benefits. In some circumstances you can be credited with earnings or "Class 1" contributions, which may help you satisfy the entitlement conditions for certain benefits. If you are a carer receiving Carer''s Allowance, you should be credited with Class 1 contributions for each week the benefit is paid. You may also be able to get credits if you''re a carer but you''re not eligible for Carer''s Allowance – see Carer''s Credit for more information. You can also receive credits: for each complete week you receive Jobseeker''s Allowance or you are available for work and actively seeking work – even if you are not entitled to Jobseeker''s Allowance, signing on at a Jobcentre Plus office will help protect your contributions record for one or two complete tax years when you are on a course of full-time training, education or an apprenticeship for each week you receive either Statutory Maternity Pay or Statutory Adoption Pay for each week you receive the disability element or severe disability element of Working Tax Credit Carers: protecting your pension One in five carers is forced to give up employment so they can look after someone, and this causes gaps in their pension record. As a result, many carers struggle to make ends meet when they reach retirement age. This means that if you''re a carer, protecting your pensions can be an important issue. To receive a state retirement pension, you must have: paid enough NI contributions been credited with enough NI contributions, or  a combination of the two There are ways to ensure your pension is protected if you are a carer. These include NI credits or Carer''s Credit. For example, for every week that Carer''s Allowance is paid, you are credited with a NI contribution. This helps people who are unable to work or have cut down their working hours as a result of caring. If you are not entitled to Carer''s Allowance, you may be able to claim Carer''s Credit instead. You may also have a private or work pension, and may want to understand the range of pensions that exist and where to seek help if you''re going to take a break from paying into a private or works pension.  Getting help with your pension As a carer, your working years may be a combination of paid employment in full-time, part-time, well-paid or low-paid jobs. There may be years when you haven''t done any paid work or you''ve spent long periods in part-time or low-paid employment. You can still benefit from a private pension in addition to the State Pension. There are many non-State Pension schemes on offer, and you may wish to consider them all before deciding whether you want to take out a personal or stakeholder pension. However, you can also get help making your decision from a financial adviser or specialist. Financial Conduct Authority All companies offering advice on pensions or other financial products must be registered by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). You can check if the person or company you''re using is registered by calling the Money Advice Line on 0300 500 5000 or using the FCA online register. The Pensions Advisory Service The Pensions Advisory Service is an independent non-profit organisation that provides free information, advice and guidance on state, company, personal and stakeholder pension schemes. Pension tracing The GOV.UK Pension Tracing Service can help you find a pension company you have lost track of, even if you don''t have all the details. For more information, see GOV.UK, the government''s official online source of information on benefits and pensions. Carer''s Credit and gaps in your NI record Carer''s Credit is a NI contribution. It can help ensure carers do not lose out on some social security benefits, such as the State Pension, because of gaps in their NI record. It''s available to people who look after someone for 20 or more hours a week and who do not get Carer''s Allowance. Carer''s Credit can help protect your State Pension, and applies to both the basic and state second pension. The weekly Carer''s Credit is designed to help if you would have difficulty building a State Pension. This might be because: you''re caring for someone 20 hours or more a week you''re looking after someone who refuses to claim disability benefits, or finds it extremely difficult because of their condition – for example, this might apply if you look after someone with a mental illness more than one person is looking after the person who is severely disabled and you''re not the one claiming Carer''s Allowance (only one person can claim Carer''s Allowance for an ill or disabled person) you cannot claim Carer''s Allowance because you''re looking after more than one person, but do not care for any of them for 35 hours a week To claim Carer''s Credit, you must care for 20 hours or more a week for someone who gets any rate of Attendance Allowance or Constant Attendance Allowance, or the middle or highest Disability Living Allowance care component. If the person you care for doesn''t get one of these benefits, you''ll qualify if you care for 20 or more hours a week for someone who has a signed certificate from a health or social care professional that confirms the level of care being provided is appropriate. To apply for Carer''s Credit, visit GOV.UK or call the Carer''s Allowance Unit on 0845 608 4321.

Vaccination is usually only recommended for travellers to areas where cholera is widespread, particularly for aid workers and people who are likely to have limited access to medical services. The cholera vaccine is usually available on the NHS, but this can vary. It''s also available through private prescription from a private travel clinic. The vaccine The cholera vaccine is given as a drink, where the vaccination ingredients are mixed with water. You should avoid eating, drinking or taking oral medication for an hour before and after having the vaccination. For adults and children over the age of six, two doses of the vaccine are needed to protect against cholera for two years. After this, a booster is required if you continue to be at risk. Children who are two to six years of age will need to have three doses of the vaccine. This will protect them for six months. After this, they will need to have a booster if they continue to be at risk. All the doses must be taken one to six weeks apart. If more than six weeks passes between doses, you''ll need to start the full vaccination course again. Ideally, the vaccination course should be completed at least one week before travelling. The cholera vaccine isn''t recommended for children under two years of age, because it''s not clear how well it works in this age group. Side effects and precautions After having the cholera vaccine, less than 1 in 100 people will experience short-term symptoms similar to a mild stomach upset, such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea. Severe reactions are very rare. Most people can have the vaccination safely, but you should tell the doctor or nurse before being vaccinated if you: have a high temperature (fever) or stomach upset are pregnant or think you might be pregnant are breastfeeding have a condition, or are receiving treatment, that affects your immune system In these circumstances, you may still be able to have the vaccine if you''re at a high risk of getting cholera, but your doctor or nurse may need to check with a travel medicine specialist before giving it to you. The vaccination may need to be delayed if you''re unwell with a fever or upset stomach. You shouldn''t have the vaccine if you''ve had an allergic reaction to the cholera vaccine or any of the vaccine components in the past. Reporting side effects The Yellow Card Scheme allows you to report suspected side effects from any type of medicine you''re taking.

This legal authority is called "power of attorney". The person who is given power of attorney is known as the "attorney" and must be over 18 years old. The person who is giving the power of attorney is known as the "donor". Appointing attorneys A donor can appoint just one attorney, or more than one attorney, to act as follows: "jointly" – they must always make decisions together "jointly and severally" – they have to make some decisions together and some individually "jointly" on some matters, and "jointly and severally" on others For example, someone can appoint attorneys to act jointly when making decisions over their money, but state that only one attorney, acting independently (or severally), should decide where the person should live. The person has the right to say the attorneys must act jointly on all their affairs. If more than one attorney is appointed to deal with the same issue, they must act jointly unless the power of attorney states they do not need to. The attorneys must agree before they act on the issue. Types of power of attorney There are different types of power of attorney: Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPA) personal welfare LPA property and affairs LPA Enduring Powers of Attorney (EPA) An EPA deals only with property and affairs, which includes financial affairs and accessing the person''s information. It is no longer possible to create an EPA as they were made under a previous law, the Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985, before the Mental Capacity Act 2005 came into effect in this area. An EPA made before October 1 2007 remains valid. Both EPAs and LPAs must be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian. LPAs can be registered at any time. Donors can register LPAs while they are able to make decisions for themselves. Alternatively, LPAs can be registered by attorneys at any time. However, personal welfare LPAs will only be effective once the person has lost the capacity to make their own decisions. EPAs made under the old law can only be registered if the donor is losing, or has lost, their mental capacity and must be registered by the attorney. You can apply for LPA on GOV.UK, or you can contact the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) for an application pack: by post at the Office of the Public Guardian, PO Box 16185, Birmingham, B2 2WH by phone on 0300 456 0300 – lines are open Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm, and 10am to 5pm on Wednesdays For people who want to go online but have difficulty using IT for whatever reason, OPG provides assistance. Ask OPG for more information. Keep reading, or click on the links below to find out more about: Applying for power of attorney Registering power of attorney Cancelling power of attorney Applying for power of attorney As a donor, to give power of attorney you should understand exactly what powers you are giving to someone else. GOV.UK has information to help you understand what an LPA means for you and the person you appoint to make decisions for you. You can also make a power of attorney online. You can talk to a lawyer if you have problems answering any of the questions or if you want them to check what you have done. You can call the Office of the Public Guardian and the Court of Protection first to see if they can help on 0300 456 0300. Legal aid, in the form of advice and assistance, may be available for welfare LPA issues, but not for property LPA. The Law Society will be able to tell you which solicitors offer legal aid. You will be eligible for this legal aid only if you pass a means test. You can contact the Law Society by writing to them at 100-113 Chancery Lane, London WC2A 1PL, or by calling 020 7242 1222. You can also search for solicitors who specialise in this area on the Law Society online directory. Execution of Power of Attorney forms and ''certificate of capacity'' Once the LPA is completed, it has to be printed and signed (or "executed") in the presence of a witness, who certifies that when the form was signed, the person granting the power of attorney: understood its purpose and the scope of authority being granted was not being unduly pressured or being defrauded  was not affected by anything else that could affect the validity of the document This certificate can be signed by either someone known to the person making the LPA for at least two years, or by someone who "because of their relevant professional skills and expertise, considers themselves able to provide the certificate".  This person must be acting independently and must not be a relative, business partner or employee, or anyone involved in a care home where the person lives. If the donor is under a section of the Mental Health Act 1983, they can still make a Lasting Power of Attorney order as long as they have the mental capacity to do so. Being granted personal welfare LPA over someone else Having an LPA over someone''s personal welfare may mean you need to make decisions about the healthcare and welfare of the person you are looking after. There may be one or more people with this responsibility, who will each be referred to as the person''s attorney. If you have this power, you may have to decide: where the person is to live whether a care home or a nursing home is best for them, and which one whether the person can continue to live at home with help from social services You will be able to decide if the donor should: receive healthcare treatment not receive a particular healthcare treatment stop receiving a particular healthcare treatment Some people who have a progressive illness sometimes make a decision about whether they would want a particular treatment in the future. They write down or tell others these wishes while they are mentally well, or have "mental capacity". If the donor made a decision, in advance of losing their mental capacity, to refuse future medical treatment (known as an advance decision), you cannot override their decision unless the LPA was made later and specifies that you have the power to do so. What personal welfare power of attorney can''t do A health and welfare LPA does not come into force until such time that the donor has lost the capacity to make decisions for themselves. There are some decisions an attorney can''t make for another person. These include refusal of any medication prescribed by a responsible clinician if the person is under a section of the Mental Health Act 1983 or on leave from hospital. It may help to seek further advice, including legal advice, if you''re concerned about medication issues. If the donor is under a guardianship order, you can''t make decisions about where they should live, even though you have LPA. You will not be able to make any decisions that conflict with the wishes of a guardian. You must check whether, as an attorney under a personal welfare LPA, you can make a decision about life-sustaining treatment. Some advance decisions specifically deal with circumstances in which the person wishes to refuse life-sustaining treatment, and there are special considerations to be addressed. Lasting Power of Attorney and restraint If you have personal welfare LPA, you may sometimes consider "restraining" (stopping or hindering) the person you''re looking after from doing something you think will harm them or others. Under the law, you are considered to be restraining someone if you: physically force them to do, or stop doing, something threaten to physically force them to do, or stop doing, something prevent them going somewhere or doing something they want to ask someone else to do any of the things listed above You should not restrain the person unless: you believe they do not have the mental ability or capacity to make a decision about that particular issue  you believe it is necessary to use restraint to prevent them from harming themselves it is a reasonable action to take (or proportionate response) because you believe they may suffer serious harm – for example, you could physically stop someone from crossing the road if they were walking into traffic, but not if it was safe for them to cross the road Being granted property and affairs LPA for someone else If you have property and affairs LPA, as an attorney you will be allowed to make decisions on the donor''s behalf. These include: writing cheques and paying bills selling or renting property carrying out their trade or business honouring any contractual obligations conducting legal proceedings on their behalf The attorney is allowed to make gifts in the following circumstances: on customary occasions to those related to or connected with the donor to any charity to which gifts had or might have been expected to be made as long as the value of each gift is not unreasonable in the circumstances "Customary occasion" means, for example, a birthday, marriage or civil partnership, or any other instance where presents are commonly given within families or among friends or associates. Registering a power of attorney A power of attorney is only effective once it has been registered. You can register a power of attorney on GOV.UK. Either the person making the application for power of attorney (the donor) or the person who is to have power of attorney (the attorney) can apply to register the application. The fees can be processed online, but the paper-based LPA (the deed) must be sent to OPG for registration. The applicant has to give notice to everyone named by the donor as having power of attorney. They must do this by completing and sending them the set form LPA001. The Public Guardian will notify the donor if the application is made by an attorney. The Public Guardian must give written notice to: the donor, if the application is made by the attorney  the attorney(s), if the application is made by the donor  an attorney, if the application is made by another attorney There is a six-week notice period, beginning on the date of the last notice, for any objections to be raised. Once the power of attorney has been registered, the original document is returned to the applicant, and the Public Guardian also gives notice to the donor that the LPA has been registered. Cancelling power of attorney The donor can cancel their power of attorney at any time, even if the application has been registered. However, they must have the mental capacity to make that decision, and must tell their attorneys and the OPG so they can remove the LPA from the register. Power of attorney automatically ends if: the attorney or donor dies the attorney or donor becomes bankrupt (depending on circumstances outlined below) a marriage or civil partnership between the donor and the attorney is dissolved or annulled the attorneys lack the mental capacity to make decisions ending personal welfare LPA As well as the donor, the OPG can cancel registration of an LPA on factual grounds (such as the death of an attorney), and the Court of Protection can terminate an LPA for reasons such as the attorney not carrying out their duties correctly. Ending property and affairs LPA Property and affairs LPA is also automatically cancelled if either the donor or attorney becomes bankrupt. In the case of a trust corporation, LPA automatically ends if the trust is wound up or dissolved. If the bankruptcy is the result of an interim (limited in time) bankruptcy restriction order, a property and affairs LPA is suspended until the order ends. The Court of Protection can revoke an LPA if an attorney is not acting in a person''s best interests and is making excessive "gifts" to themselves or others. Ending enduring power of attorney (EPA) To revoke an unregistered EPA, you will need to sign a formal document called a "Deed of Revocation". You may wish to seek legal advice first. You can revoke an unregistered EPA at any time while you have the mental capacity to do so. If the EPA has been registered, it cannot be revoked except by permission of the Court of Protection.

It may be unpleasant and uncomfortable, but can usually be treated with medication available from pharmacies or on prescription from your GP. However, for some women, vaginal thrush can be difficult to treat and keeps coming back. This page covers: Symptoms of vaginal thrush What to do if you have vaginal thrush How to treat vaginal thrush What causes vaginal thrush? Preventing vaginal thrush Symptoms of vaginal thrush Typical symptoms of vaginal thrush include: itching and soreness around the entrance of the vagina (itchy labia) vaginal discharge – this is usually odourless and may be thick and white or thin and watery pain during sex, which may make you worry about having sex a stinging sensation when peeing Sometimes the skin around the vagina can be red, swollen or cracked. Occasionally there may also be sores on the skin, although this is more often a sign of genital herpes. You can use the vagina problems visual guide to help find out what could be causing your symptoms. What to do if you have vaginal thrush If you''ve had thrush before and think you have it again, you can normally treat it with medicines bought from a local pharmacy. See How to treat vaginal thrush below for more information. It''s a good idea to get medical advice from your GP or a sexual health clinic if: you have thrush for the first time you''re under the age of 16 or over 60 you''re pregnant or breastfeeding – read more about thrush in pregnancy you have unusual symptoms, such as coloured or smelly discharge, or sores on the skin around your vagina  you have abnormal vaginal bleeding or pain in your lower tummy you''ve had two episodes of thrush within the last six months you''ve reacted badly to antifungal treatment in the past, or it didn''t work you or your partner have previously had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and you think it might have returned your symptoms don''t improve after 7-14 days of treatment Thrush isn''t usually anything to worry about in these cases, but your doctor may want to take a swab from your vagina to confirm the diagnosis and/or carry out tests to check for any underlying cause. They can also advise you about the most suitable treatment and give you a prescription, if necessary. How to treat vaginal thrush Mild thrush can usually be treated with a short course of antifungal medication. The symptoms will usually clear up within a week or two. Treatment may need to be continued for longer if you have repeated bouts of thrush. Several thrush medicines can be bought over the counter from pharmacies, while others are only available on prescription from your GP. The main types are: pessaries – a special pill that you insert into your vagina using a special applicator intravaginal creams – these are also placed into the vagina using an applicator capsules – these are swallowed and may be more convenient to use than pessaries or intravaginal cream, but can have more troublesome side effects, such as vomiting or an upset stomach These treatments are all equally effective. You can usually choose the treatment you prefer, although pregnant or breastfeeding women shouldn''t take the capsules. You can also get creams to apply to the skin surrounding the entrance of your vagina. These can help relieve itchiness and soreness, although you may find that an ordinary emollient (moisturiser) works just as well. Read more about treating vaginal thrush. What causes vaginal thrush? Vaginal thrush is caused by yeasts from a group of fungi called Candida. Many women have Candida in their vagina without it causing any problems, but thrush can develop if the natural balance of micro-organisms in the vagina is disrupted and Candida multiplies. You''re more likely to get thrush if you: are in your twenties and thirties – thrush is less common in girls who haven''t started their periods and women who have been through the menopause are pregnant have sex when you''re not fully aroused or you''re worried it may hurt – this can lead to vaginal dryness and tightness during sex, which can trigger thrush take antibiotics have poorly controlled diabetes have a weakened immune system – for example, because of a condition such as HIV or a treatment such as chemotherapy Vaginal thrush isn''t classed as an STI, but it can be triggered by sex – particularly if you have trouble relaxing and your vagina is dry – and can occasionally be passed on to sexual partners. Preventing vaginal thrush If you get thrush frequently, you can: use water and an emollient (moisturiser) soap substitute to clean the skin around your vagina, but avoid cleaning this area more than once a day apply a greasier moisturiser to the skin around your vagina several times a day to protect it (but be aware that these moisturisers can weaken condoms) avoid potential irritants in perfumed soaps, shower gels, vaginal deodorants, wipes and douches avoid wearing tight-fitting underwear or tights – some women find that special silk underwear designed for people with eczema and thrush is helpful ensure your blood sugar level is kept under control, if you have diabetes Some women eat probiotic yoghurt or supplements to prevent vaginal thrush, but there''s little evidence to suggest this works.

It''s given as a single injection to protect your baby against five serious childhood diseases:  diphtheria  tetanus  whooping cough (pertussis)  polio  Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) When should babies have the 5-in-1 vaccine? The 5-in-1 vaccine is given three times – when babies are 8, 12 and 16 weeks old. Your baby needs three doses to make sure they develop strong immunity against the five diseases the vaccine protects against. Every time another dose of the vaccine is given, your baby''s immune response increases. How is the 5-in-1 vaccine given? The vaccine is injected into your baby''s thigh. How well does the 5-in-1 vaccine work? The 5-in-1 vaccine works well. It produces very good immunity to diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Hib and polio infections. How safe is the 5-in-1 vaccine? The 5-in-1 vaccine is very safe. It''s inactivated, which means it doesn''t contain any live organisms, so there is no risk of your baby getting the diseases it protects against. The vaccine also has few side effects, although it''s common for babies to be a little irritable afterwards. They may also have a short-lived small bump, redness and swelling at the injection site.  There are two 5-in-1 vaccines that are used in the UK. Either can be given to babies as part of the childhood vaccination programme. Their brand names are Pediacel and Infanrix IPV Hib. Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for Pediacel (PDF, 37.43kb). Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for Infanrix IPV Hib (PDF, 66.7kb). Read more about 5-in-1 vaccine side effects. Can the 5-in-1 be given at the same time as other vaccines? It''s safe for your baby to have the 5-in-1 vaccine at the same time as other vaccines, such as the rotavirus vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine and Men B vaccine. Which babies should not have the 5-in-1 infant vaccine? The vast majority of babies can have the 5-in-1 jab, but there are a few babies who should not have it. They include babies who: are allergic to the vaccine have a fever at the time of the vaccination appointment  have signs of a neurological problem that is getting worse, including poorly controlled epilepsy The vaccine should not be given to babies who have had an anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) to a previous dose of the vaccine, or a reaction to any part of the vaccine that may be present in trace amounts, such as neomycin, streptomycin or polymixin B. There is no need to postpone vaccination if your baby has a minor illness, such as a cough or a cold with no fever. But if your baby is ill with a fever, it''s best to delay vaccination until they have recovered. Children who show signs of a neurological problem that is getting worse, including poorly controlled epilepsy, should have their vaccination postponed until they have been seen by a specialist. If your child has a history of febrile convulsions (fits) or has suffered a fit within 72 hours of a previous dose of the vaccine, speak to your GP, nurse or health visitor. They will advise you about what to do. What if I miss the 5-in-1 vaccination appointment? It''s best for babies to be vaccinated at the recommended age, as they are then protected from serious diseases as early in life as possible. However, don''t worry if your baby has missed an appointment for the 5-in-1 vaccination. It''s never too late to have it. Make an appointment with your GP surgery or local child health clinic.

(135, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/mental-health-aftercare.aspx', 'Mental health aftercare', 'Mental health aftercare - Care and support guide - NHS Choices', '', 'If you have been compulsorily detained for treatment in a psychiatric hospital, any "mental health aftercare" that you may need when you leave hospital should be provided free of charge. This free aftercare is given to try to prevent your condition getting worse and you needing to be re-admitted to hospital. People entitled to free mental health aftercare won''t have to go through a financial assessment for any social or health services arising from or related to their mental disorder. This right to free services was established in section 117 of the Mental Health Act 1983. It applies in the following situations: When someone has been compulsorily detained in hospital under section 3 of the Mental Health Act. When someone has been sentenced by a criminal court to detention in a psychiatric hospital. When someone has been transferred to psychiatric hospital from prison. Section 117 doesn''t apply to people who have been detained in hospital for assessment under section 2 of the Mental Health Act, or people who have been detained in an emergency under section 4 of the Mental Health Act. Section 117 also doesn''t apply to people who have been in psychiatric hospital as voluntary patients only. However, it will apply if someone who was previously compulsorily detained in hospital under section 3 agrees to stay there on a voluntary basis, unless they have no mental health aftercare needs. How to get access to aftercare services If you’re eligible for aftercare, your needs will be assessed before you''re discharged from hospital. You will receive a care plan stating the services that will be provided. What does aftercare include? Aftercare can include almost anything arising from or related to the person’s mental disorder that helps someone live in the community. It may include, for example, help with specialised accommodation, social care support, day centre facilities or recreational activities. Aftercare doesn''t refer to any specific services, but the services must either arise from or be related to your mental disorder. The range of services covered is nevertheless broad, so it may be possible to argue that it covers the services you require. The care plan may make arrangements for housing needs, particularly if you are likely to be homeless when you’re discharged from hospital or can''t return home for some reason. The accommodation provided may be in supported housing, such as a hostel. If you need services from a wide range of providers, you should be assessed under the Care Programme Approach (CPA) and a named person should act as your care co-ordinator. You could be assessed under the CPA even if you do not qualify for services under section 117. For example, you may meet the criteria for the CPA despite only having been in hospital as a voluntary patient, because you have complex needs.    Termination of section 117 services (aftercare) If social services or the relevant healthcare organisation believes that you no longer need aftercare, section 117 services may be withdrawn. However, the organisations must reassess your needs before they can come to that conclusion. The relevant organisations have to provide reasons for their decision. People with significant mental health problems may be able to argue that they''re at risk of needing re-admission to hospital. In such a case, section 117 will continue to apply. If section 117 no longer applies, it doesn''t necessarily mean that the services will be withdrawn. A financial assessment will be carried out to decide whether the person receiving the services has to make a financial contribution. Disputes about section 117 services You or your carer may believe that you''re being incorrectly charged for services that should be provided for free under section 117. This is a complex area. If you feel that this may apply to you or the person you''re looking after, it''s best to get legal advice.

TB is a serious infection which affects the lungs and sometimes other parts of the body, such as the bones, joints and kidneys. It can also cause meningitis. Read more about tuberculosis (TB). Who should have the BCG vaccine? The BCG vaccine (which stands for Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine) is not given as part of the routine NHS vaccination schedule. It''s given on the NHS only when a child or adult is thought to have an increased risk of coming into contact with TB. BCG for babies BCG vaccination is recommended for babies who are born in areas where TB rates are higher than in the rest of the country, including some parts of inner London. BCG for children BCG vaccination may also be recommended for older children who have an increased risk of developing TB, such as: children who have recently arrived from countries with high levels of TB, including those in sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian sub-continent and parts of Eastern Europe children who have come into close contact with somebody infected with respiratory TB BCG for adults BCG vaccination is rarely given to anyone over the age of 16 – and never over the age of 35, because it doesn''t work very well in adults. It is, however, given to adults aged 16 to 35 who are at risk of TB through their work, such as some healthcare workers. Read more about who should have the BCG vaccine. How is the BCG vaccination given? BCG vaccination is given as an injection into the upper arm. The vaccination usually leaves a small scar. Read more about potential BCG vaccination side effects. When is the BCG vaccination given? If it''s advised that your baby has the BCG vaccine, the injection is usually offered soon after birth, while your baby is still in hospital. Alternatively, your baby can be referred to a local healthcare centre for vaccination after they''ve left hospital. This may not necessarily be the local GP surgery, as not all surgeries can provide this service. If you are offered BCG vaccination as an adult, it will be arranged by a local healthcare centre. How effective is BCG vaccination? The BCG vaccine is made from a weakened strain of TB bacteria. Because the bacteria in the vaccine is weak, it triggers the immune system to protect against the disease, giving good immunity to people who receive it, without actually causing the disease. The vaccine is 70-80% effective against the most severe forms of TB, such as TB meningitis in children. It is less effective in preventing respiratory disease, which is the more common form of TB in adults.   Page last reviewed: 26/04/2016 Next review due: 26/04/2018 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

If you have "eligible" needs, your council will talk to you about what help might be available. This will be based on the information you gave them during your assessment. If you do not have needs that are eligible for support, your council will give you information and advice about what alternative support is available to help you locally. This could include help from a local voluntary organisation, for example. Eligibility for support From April 2015, local authorities have a legal duty to meet a carer’s eligible needs for support. When a carer''s assessment is complete, the local authority must decide whether the carer’s needs are eligible for support from the local authority. This eligibility depends on your situation. You''ll be entitled to support if: you are assessed as having needs that meet the eligibility criteria the person you care for lives in the local authority area (which means their established home is in that area) Support planning After your carer’s assessment, you should receive a written care plan identifying your needs and any information, support or services that could be provided, such as breaks from caring. Social services should liaise with other authorities (such as housing or a health organisation), if that is relevant for you. Your care and support plan should include details of what should happen if your situation gets worse. However, if your situation does change, you should contact social services and ask them to reassess you. Personal budgets and direct payments As part of your support plan, you''ll receive a personal budget. This is a statement showing the cost of meeting your needs. You can choose to take this personal budget in the form of direct payments. Charging and financial assessment In most cases, local authorities do not charge for providing support to carers because of the valuable contribution that carers make. However, this is something that the local authority can decide. If the local authority does decide to charge a carer for providing them with support, it must carry out a financial assessment to decide whether the carer can afford to pay. If you are a carer, you will only be charged for services provided to you, not for services that are for the person you are looking after. If supporting a carer involves providing care to the person being cared for, and the local authority chooses to charge for that type of care, then the authority must carry out a financial assessment of the person who is being cared for. This is because the care would be provided directly to that adult, and not to the carer. Read more about paying for services.

Atopic eczema is more common in children, often developing before their first birthday. However, it may also develop for the first time in adults. It''s usually a long-term (chronic) condition, although it can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older. This topic covers: Symptoms When to seek medical advice Causes Treatment Other types of eczema Symptoms of atopic eczema Atopic eczema causes the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked, sore and red. Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body.             Although atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, it most often affects the hands, insides of the elbows, backs of the knees and the face and scalp in children. People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups). Read about the symptoms of atopic eczema  When to seek medical advice See your GP if you have symptoms of atopic eczema. They''ll usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions such as: whether the rash is itchy and where it appears when the symptoms first began whether it comes and goes over time whether there''s a history of atopic eczema in your family whether you have any other conditions, such as allergies or asthma whether something in your diet or lifestyle may be contributing to your symptoms Typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and three or more of the following: visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin – such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above generally dry skin in the last 12 months a history of asthma or hay fever – children under four must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has one of these conditions the condition started before the age of two (this does not apply to children under the age of four) Causes of atopic eczema The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it''s clear it is not down to one single thing. Atopic eczema often occurs in people who get allergies – "atopic" means sensitivity to allergens. It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever. The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather. Sometimes food allergies can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema. You may be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse. Allergy tests aren''t usually needed, although they''re sometimes helpful in identifying whether a food allergy may be triggering symptoms. Read about the causes of atopic eczema. Treating atopic eczema  Treatment for atopic eczema can help to relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time. However, there''s currently no cure and severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life, which may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally. There''s also an increased risk of skin infections.  Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including: self care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers emollients (moisturising treatments) – used on a daily basis for dry skin  topical corticosteroids – used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups Read about treating atopic eczema and complications of atopic eczema.

If you are with someone and they start to experience the symptoms of anaphylaxis, dial 999 immediately to request an ambulance. See the treatment of anaphylaxis for more information. Chronic fatigue and the HPV vaccine There have been reports in the press alleging that girls have developed chronic fatigue syndrome after HPV vaccination. The cause of CFS (otherwise known as ME, or myalgic encephalomyelitis) is not known, but it does occur naturally in teenagers, and is more common in girls than boys. There are no more cases of CFS than would be expected in teenage girls and there is no evidence to link CFS to the HPV vaccine. The WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) regularly review the emerging international evidence on the safety of HPV vaccination and issued a statement in March 2014 concluding there is no proven link between the HPV vaccination and autoimmune disease, of which many think CFS/ME is an example. How to spot and report side effects The Yellow Card Scheme allows you to report suspected side effects from any medicine you are taking including vaccines. It is run by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Find out how to report a vaccine side effect.

(144, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/personal-independence-payment.aspx', 'Personal Independence Payment', 'Personal Independence Payment - Care and support guide - NHS Choices', '', 'Personal Independence Payment (PIP) is the new benefit that’s replacing Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for people with a disability who are aged 16 to 64. PIP is designed to help you meet some of the extra costs you may have because of a long-term health condition or disability. Claiming PIP Anyone aged 16 to 64 who wants to start a new claim for a disability benefit will have to claim PIP. If you are under 16, you should claim DLA for children instead. If you’re 65 or over, you should claim Attendance Allowance instead. Most DLA claimants will not be assessed for PIP before October 2015. However, current DLA claimants in many areas are already being asked to claim PIP. To make your claim, call 0800 917 2222 (textphone 0800 917 7777) to register your details and you will be sent the "how your disability affects you" form. Am I affected by the change from DLA to PIP? Use the online PIP checker at GOV.UK: PIP checker to see how and when you may be affected by the move to PIP. Who qualifies for PIP? To qualify for PIP, you must have needed help with extra costs caused by a health condition or disability for three months or more (although you can make a claim sooner than this). You must also be likely to need help for the next nine months. You must have been in Great Britain for at least two of the last three years, and be habitually resident in the UK, Ireland, Isle of Man or the Channel Islands. You have to be in Great Britain when you claim (exceptions are made for some, most notably the armed forces). You must also not be subject to immigration control (unless you are a sponsored immigrant). There are some exceptions to these conditions if you’re living in or coming from certain European countries. Citizens Advice has more information on immigration control. How PIP is paid PIP is paid as two separate components. These are: a daily living component a mobility component The daily living and mobility components can each be paid at the standard rate or the enhanced rate, depending on your needs. The amount you get is based on how your health condition or disability affects how well you carry out everyday activities. It takes into account the difficulties you face and the help you would need to do them – even if you don’t actually get any help. The decision about whether you receive PIP for daily living depends on your ability to carry out certain activities, including: preparing food and eating managing therapy or monitoring a health condition  washing and bathing managing toilet needs or incontinence dressing and undressing communicating verbally reading mixing with other people making decisions about money The decision about whether you receive PIP for mobility depends on your ability to move around, and to plan for and undertake a journey. How your entitlement to PIP is decided Once you have started your claim by phone, you will be asked to complete a "how your disability affects you" form. On the form, you will be asked to describe your condition or disability and how it affects you. You should include any supporting evidence you have, including details of your doctor or of another health professional who is best placed to offer advice about your condition. Most people will have to attend a face-to-face consultation with a health professional as part of their claim. Everyone will have a varying level of ability to carry out the activities outlined above. Some people will be able to complete an activity without help, while others may not be able to complete the activity at all. For each activity, a point score is decided based on this level of ability and need (the point scores increase as needs increase). The PIP assessment also takes into account where support is needed from other people to carry out an activity. This can include supervision (to stop accidents happening), prompting (to remind or encourage you about the activity, but not physically help) and assistance (where a carer needs to be physically present to do, or intervene with, an activity). The standard rate of the PIP component is paid if a person has a total score from 8 to 11 points (inclusive). The enhanced rate of the PIP component is paid if a person has a score of 12 points. If you are eligible for PIP, this decision will be reviewed from time to time to make sure it is still correct and continues to meet your needs. If you are not eligible, or you are unhappy with your PIP claim in some other way, you may want to ask for the decision to be reconsidered. If you are not satisfied with the response after this, you may wish to appeal the decision. Claiming PIP if you are terminally ill PIP claims from people who have a terminal illness and are not expected to live for more than six months are dealt with more quickly. These people will not be required to attend a face-to-face consultation, or to fulfil the three-month qualifying period for claiming PIP. If the basic conditions are met, both the daily living and the mobility component of PIP will be paid straight away. A DS1500 medical report (available from your doctor, nurse, social worker or palliative care nurse) will help to support the claim. As PIP is claimed by phone, it is important that the DS1500 has the patient’s date of birth, postcode and, if possible, National Insurance number on it. PIP claims if your circumstances change If you are getting PIP, it is your responsibility to tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) if your circumstances change, because this can affect how much you get. You’ll need to tell the DWP if the level of help you need changes or your condition changes. You’ll need to tell the DWP if you go into hospital or a care home for more than four weeks. PIP is not usually paid if you are in hospital when you claim, but will be paid when you leave. However, it may be paid if you’re a private patient and you’re paying without help from the NHS, or if you are in a hospice because you are terminally ill. If you go abroad for more than four weeks, you must get agreement from the DWP for PIP to continue before you go. It is possible for you to continue to get PIP if you:  go abroad for 13 weeks or less, or go abroad temporarily to get treatment for your incapacity or disability You can contact the DWP on 0845 850 3322 (textphone 0845 601 6677) to let them know how your circumstances have changed.

How do I take part in a clinical trial? Why join a clinical trial? Will I get paid? What happens in a clinical trial? What should I know before I sign up? How are trials regulated and judged ethical? How are trial results used to improve treatment? Where can I find results from trials that are relevant to me?  How do I take part in a clinical trial? You can ask your doctor or a patient organisation if they know of any clinical trials that you may be eligible to join. You can also search for information on a number of websites and register your interest in taking part in research. The main ones are described below. UK Clinical Trials Gateway The UK Clinical Trials Gateway (UKCTG) website pulls through information about clinical trials and other research from several different UK registers. If you sign up to it, researchers can contact you about research that might be suitable for you.  You can also search the UKCTG site in various ways to find trials relevant to you, and you can contact researchers yourself. WHO International Clinical Trials The World Health Organization''s Clinical Trials Search Portal provides access to clinical trials in countries all around the world. Charities For some conditions, you can find out about clinical trials from the websites of charities. Examples are: Arthritis Research UK: current clinical trials and studies Cancer Research UK: find a clinical trial   Multiple Sclerosis Society: MS clinical trials     Target Ovarian Cancer: clinical trials information centre Why join a clinical trial? Clinical trials help doctors understand how to treat a particular disease or condition. It may benefit you, or others like you, in the future. If you take part in a clinical trial, you may be one of the first people to benefit from a new treatment. However, there is also a chance that the new treatment turns out to be no better, or worse, than the standard treatment. To hear other people''s experiences of taking part in a clinical trial, visit healthtalk.org: clinical trials. Will I get paid? Some clinical trials offer payment, which can vary from hundreds to thousands of pounds depending on what is involved and expected from you. Some trials don''t offer payment and just cover your travel expenses. It''s important to find out about the inconvenience and risks involved before you sign up, and to carefully weigh up whether it is worth it. Bear in mind: it can be time consuming – you may be expected to attend a number of screening and follow-up sessions, and some trials require you to stay overnight there may be restrictions on what you can and cannot do – for example, you may be asked to not eat or drink alcohol for a period of time you may experience unknown side effects from the treatment What happens in a clinical trial? Testing a new medicine All clinical trials of new medicines go through a series of phases to test whether they are safe and whether they work. The medicines will usually be tested against another treatment called a control. This will either be a dummy treatment (a placebo) or a standard treatment already in use. Learn more about the placebo effect. Phase one trials: A small number of people, who may be healthy volunteers, are given the medicine. The drug is being trialled in human volunteers for the first time. Researchers test for side effects and calculate what the right dose might be to use in treatment. Researchers start with small doses and only increase the dose if the volunteers don''t experience any side effects, or if they only experience minor side effects. Phase two trials: The new medicine is tested on a larger group of people who are ill. This is to get a better idea of its effects in the short term. Phase three trials: Carried out on medicines that have passed phases one and two. The medicine is tested in larger groups of people who are ill, and compared against an existing treatment or a placebo to see if it''s better in practice and if it has important side effects. Trials often last a year or more and involve several thousand patients. Phase four trials: The safety, side effects and effectiveness of the medicine continue to be studied while it is being used in practice. Not required for every medicine. Only carried out on medicines that have passed all the previous stages and have been given marketing licences – a licence means the medicine can be made available on prescription. Control groups, randomisation and blinding If you take part in a clinical trial, you will usually be randomly assigned to either the: treatment group – where you''ll be given the treatment being assessed, or  control group – where you''ll be given an existing standard treatment, or a placebo if no proven standard treatment exists While the treatments are different in the two groups, researchers try to keep as many of the other conditions the same as possible. For example, both groups should have people of a similar age, with a similar proportion of men and women, who are in similar overall health. In most trials, a computer will be used to randomly decide which group each patient will be allocated to. Many trials are set up so nobody knows who''s been allocated to receive which treatment. This is known as blinding, and it helps reduce the effects of bias when comparing the outcomes of the treatments. What should I know before I sign up? When you express interest in a trial, a doctor or nurse is likely to tell you something about it in person. You''ll also be given some printed information to take away. You may come back with some questions you feel haven''t been answered. General questions What is the aim of the trial and how will it help people? Who is funding the trial? What treatment will I get if I do not take part in the trial? How long is the trial expected to last, and how long will I have to take part? How long will it be before the results of the trial are known? What will happen if I stop the trial treatment or leave the trial before it ends? What would happen if something went wrong? It''s rare for patients to be harmed by trial treatments, but you may want to ask about compensation if this were to happen. Practical questions How much of my time will be needed? Will I need to take time off work? Will I be paid? Will the costs of my travel to take part in the trial be covered? If the trial is testing a new drug, will I have to collect it from the hospital, will it be sent to me by post, or will I get it through my doctor? Will I have to complete questionnaires or keep a diary? What are the possible side effects of my treatment? How could the treatments affect me physically and emotionally? Who can I contact if I have a problem? Will someone be available 24 hours a day? How do I find out the results of the trial? Things to weigh up As with any treatment, you can''t be sure of the outcome. You may be given a new treatment that turns out not to be as effective as the standard treatment. Also, it''s possible you''ll experience unexpected side effects. And bear in mind that you may have to visit your place of treatment more often, or have more tests, treatments or monitoring, than you would if you were receiving the standard treatment in usual care. Leaving a trial You may decide to stop taking part in a trial if your condition is getting worse or if you feel the treatment isn''t helping you. You can also choose to leave at any point without giving a reason and without it affecting the care you receive. Results At the end of the trial, the researchers should publish the results and make them available to anyone who took part and wanted to know the results. If the researchers don''t offer you the results and you want to know, ask for them. Some research funders, such as the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), have websites where they publish the results of the research they have supported. How are trials regulated and judged ethical? Role of the MHRA Before a clinical trial of a new medicine can begin, a government agency called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) needs to review and authorise it. The MHRA inspects sites where trials take place to make sure they''re conducted in line with good clinical practice. Role of the HRA The Health Research Authority (HRA) works to protect and promote the interests of patients and the public in health research. It is responsible for research ethics committees up and down the country.  All medical research involving people in the UK, whether in the NHS or the private sector, first has to be approved by an independent research ethics committee. The committee protects the rights and interests of the people who will be in the trial. How are trial results used to improve treatment? Clinical trials can help: prevent illnesses by testing a vaccine detect or diagnose illnesses by testing a scan or blood test treat illnesses by testing new or existing medicines find out how best to provide psychological support  find out how people can control their symptoms or improve their quality of life – for example, by testing how a particular diet affects a condition Many clinical trials are designed to show whether new medicines work as expected. These results are sent to the MHRA, which decides whether to allow the company making the medicine to market it for a particular use. Licensing a treatment If research has identified a new medicine, the MHRA must license it before it can be marketed. Licensing shows a treatment has met certain standards of safety and effectiveness. Safety must be monitored carefully over the first few years of a newly licensed treatment. This is because rare side effects that weren''t obvious in clinical trials may show up for the first time. In England and Wales, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) decides whether the NHS should provide treatments. Where can I find results from trials that are relevant to me? The results of clinical trials are usually published in specialist medical journals and online libraries of evidence. Some of the most well-known examples are: The Lancet medical journal British Medical Journal (BMJ) The New England Journal of Medicine Cochrane Library – a collection of high-quality evidence NHS Evidence database You can use a search engine such as Google to look for articles and read summaries (abstracts). But you can''t usually see the full articles without a subscription to the journal. Also, research papers are not written in plain English and often use many medical, scientific and statistical terms. They can be very difficult to understand. Coverage in newspapers You''ll often see stories about research findings in mainstream media. But while news stories are easier to read than original research papers, sometimes the findings are exaggerated or sensationalised. The NHS website aims to make this clearer for you. Behind the Headlines is an independent service that analyses health stories that make the news.  It aims to explain the facts behind the headlines and give a better understanding of the research that was carried out.

(146, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/menopause/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Menopause', 'Menopause - NHS Choices', 'Menopause  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  The menopause is when a woman stops having periods and is no longer able to get pregnant naturally. Periods usually start to become less frequent over a few months or years before they stop altogether. Sometimes they can stop suddenly. The menopause is a natural part of ageing that usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age, as a woman''s oestrogen levels decline. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 51. However, around 1 in 100 women experience the menopause before 40 years of age. This is known as premature menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency. Symptoms of the menopause Most women will experience menopausal symptoms. Some of these can be quite severe and have a significant impact on your everyday activities. Common symptoms include: hot flushes  night sweats vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex difficulty sleeping low mood or anxiety reduced sex drive (libido) problems with memory and concentration Menopausal symptoms can begin months or even years before your periods stop and last around four years after your last period, although some women experience them for much longer. Read more about the symptoms of the menopause. When to see your GP It''s worth talking to your GP if you have menopausal symptoms that are troubling you or if you''re experiencing symptoms of the menopause before 45 years of age. Your GP can usually confirm whether you are menopausal based on your symptoms, but a blood test to measure your hormone levels may be carried out if you''re aged 40 to 45. Blood tests may also be carried out to help diagnose suspected premature menopause if you’re under 40 and have menopausal symptoms. Read more about how your GP can help during the menopause. Treatments for menopausal symptoms Your GP can offer treatments and suggest lifestyle changes if you have severe menopausal symptoms that interfere with your day-to-day life, including: hormone replacement therapy (HRT) – tablets, skin patches, gels and implants that relieve menopausal symptoms by replacing oestrogen vaginal oestrogen creams, lubricants or moisturisers for vaginal dryness cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – a type of talking therapy that can help with low mood and anxiety eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly – maintaining a healthy weight and staying fit and strong can improve some menopausal symptoms Your GP can refer you to a menopause specialist if your symptoms don''t improve after trying treatment or if you''re unable to take HRT. Read more about treating the menopause. What causes the menopause? The menopause is caused by a change in the balance of the body''s sex hormones, which occurs as you get older. It happens when your ovaries stop producing as much of the hormone oestrogen and no longer release an egg each month. Premature or early menopause can occur at any age, and in many cases, there''s no clear cause. Sometimes it''s caused by a treatment such as surgery to remove the ovaries (oophorectomy), some breast cancer treatments, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or it can be brought on by an underlying medical condition, such as Down''s syndrome or Addison''s disease.

(147, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/help-paying-council-tax.aspx', 'Help paying Council Tax', 'Help paying Council Tax - Care and support guide - NHS Choices', '', 'Council Tax is a tax paid every year to your local authority or council to provide services including policing, rubbish collection and street lighting. The Council Tax is a flat rate based on the value of your home. Your home is valued at one of eight bands and each local authority sets its own Council Tax rate for each band. The Council Tax Bill can be a big part of your monthly spending, so it’s wise to try to keep the costs down. You’ll usually have to make 10 monthly payments of Council Tax, although you can ask your local authority to spread them out over 12 months to make it easier for you to budget. Not everyone has to pay full Council Tax, and you can also get help paying your Council Tax through: Council Tax exemption (for example, if you are a carer) Council Tax discount (for example, if you are disabled) Council Tax Reduction for people on a low income (replaced Council Tax Benefit) discretionary help with your Council Tax; you will need to contact your local authority to and ask if they offer discretionary help and to find out whether you are eligible Council Tax exemption Your property can be exempt from Council Tax because of who lives there or certain circumstances about the dwelling. Your home will be exempt from Council Tax if the only residents are: full-time students  aged under 18  severely mentally impaired A home could be exempt for a limited period if it is: unfurnished and has been empty for up to six months (an empty homes discount of up to 50% applies) undergoing major repairs to make it habitable (for up to 12 months) homes that form part of the estate of someone who has died (may be exempt for up to six months after the grant of probate or letters of administration)  homes left empty by someone who has moved to receive personal care in a hospital or similar setting annexes that can''t be let separately from the main dwelling without breaching planning conditions To apply for exemption from Council Tax, you need to write to the council for the area where the home is located. You should detail the reasons you believe your home should be exempt – for example, your home is empty because you’re a carer who’s moved in with someone to look after them. After you have applied for a Council Tax exemption, the council may then send you a form to fill out, to help it decide. Once you’ve submitted the form, the council will then write to you giving its decision. If the council decides that you qualify for Council Tax exemption, you won''t have to pay the tax for as long as the reasons you gave remain the same. If the council decides that you don''t qualify for Council Tax exemption, and you disagree with its decision, you may want to seek advice – for example from Citizens Advice. If your circumstances that may affect your Council Tax change again, you must write to your council to let them know. The council may decide that you should not receive a Council Tax exemption and that you now have to pay. If that happens and you disagree with the decision, you can appeal to a valuation tribunal. Some properties have two or more separate self-contained dwellings. If there are family relatives who live in separate dwellings within the property and one of the relatives is dependent on the other, the flat where the dependent relative lives may qualify for Council Tax exemption. The dependent relative must be aged 65 or older, severely mentally impaired or have a substantial and permanent disability. Council Tax discount When calculating your Council Tax bill, the local authority assumes that two or more adults aged over 18 live in the home. You do not have to pay more Council Tax if more than two adults live in your home. However, you will get a 25% discount if there are fewer than two adults living in your home, or because certain people are "ignored" (for Council Tax purposes) and only one person is counted as living in your home. You will get a 50% discount if there are no adults living in your home, or because everyone who lives there has been "ignored" and no one is counted as living in your home. There is a list of who is exempt from Council Tax on GOV.UK. ‘Severe mental impairment’ and Council Tax eligibility A person is considered "severely mentally impaired" if they have a severe impairment of intelligence and social functioning, and this impairment appears to be permanent. This might be, for instance, because they have a condition such as Alzheimer’s disease, have had a stroke, or have severe learning difficulties. To qualify for the discount, they will need proof from a registered medical practitioner. They must also be entitled to specific disability benefits. If you live with the person you care for and they satisfy the rules above, and you satisfy the rules to be a carer for Council Tax purposes, then both you and the person you care for can be ignored. A discount because of severe mental impairment can be made regardless of the income or savings of the person concerned. Backdating a Council Tax discount claim Council Tax discount can be backdated to the date when Council Tax was first introduced, on April 1 1993. You don''t have to give a reason why you didn''t previously apply for a discount, exemption or disability reduction, but you will need to provide evidence that you were eligible for previous years. Challenging a Council Tax discount decision The local authority may decide that that you should not receive a Council Tax discount, exemption or a disability reduction. You can challenge a decision by asking the local authority to look at the decision again. If this does not work, you can appeal against the decision at a valuation tribunal. It''s important that you continue to pay your Council Tax even if you''re challenging the decision with the local authority or appealing through a valuation tribunal. If you don''t, you may get behind with payments and your local authority may take action to make you pay the arrears. You can appeal to an independent body called a valuation tribunal if you disagree with the local authority’s decision (up to two months after the local authority has told you its decision), or the local authority has not replied to your letter within two months (up to four months from the date of your letter to the local authority). The tribunal will hear the following types of cases: If you think you shouldn''t be responsible for paying the Council Tax and your local authority believes you should. If the local authority will not give you a disability reduction in your Council Tax bill even though you provide evidence that a disabled person lives in your home and that your home has been adapted to meet their needs in a way that would allow a reduction. If you think you should be given a discount or exemption on your Council Tax bill and the local authority doesn''t agree. Valuation tribunals do not deal with appeals regarding Council Tax benefit, why you haven''t paid your Council Tax, or the level of Council Tax set by a local authority. You can either write to a valuation tribunal or ask it to send you a form to fill in. You can get the address of the valuation tribunal that covers your area from your local authority or the valuation tribunal website. The valuation tribunal process You will be asked to make an appeal in writing and include: which decision you are appealing against  why you disagree with the local authority’s decision, or  the fact that the local authority did not reply to your letter The tribunal normally holds an oral hearing. This means you will go to the appeal in person and explain why you think the decision is wrong. You will be sent information by the tribunal explaining the process. Hearings are informal and are usually dealt with in one day. You do not need legal representation and you will not have to pay for the hearing, unless you decide to appoint a solicitor or someone else to represent you. If you win your case at tribunal, your local authority will revise your Council Tax accordingly. Council Tax reduction If you are having trouble paying Council Tax, you should contact your local authority about a Council Tax Reduction. Council Tax Reduction (money off your bill) has replaced Council Tax Benefit (a benefit paid to you if you were on a low income). Each local authority runs it’s own Council Tax Reduction scheme, so you will need to check the details with your local authority. Some local authorities operate a "default Council Tax Reduction" scheme, which entitles you to a reduction if you are have a "low income". You can apply for Council Tax Reduction whether you own your home, rent, are unemployed or working. What Council Tax Reduction you’ll get The most you can get is a 100% Council Tax Reduction, but how much you get depends on: where you live – each council runs its own scheme your circumstances (for example, income or number of children) your household income – this includes things such as savings, pension, or your partner’s income if your children live with you  if other adults live with you People of Pension Credit qualifying age who have a low income and savings will get full Council Tax Reduction. How to apply for a Council Tax Reduction Each local authority offers its own local scheme of Council Tax Reduction. Contact your local council to apply for Council Tax Reduction. If you are not eligible for your local authority’s Council Tax Reduction scheme, you should check if you can get Discretionary help with your Council Tax. You will need to contact your local authority to ask if they offer discretionary help and to find out whether you are eligible.

Side effects of the pneumococcal vaccine in babies Mild side effects of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), which is the version of the pneumococcal vaccine given to babies under the age of two, include: decreased appetite a slightly raised temperature irritability redness at the site of the injection hardness or swelling at the site of the injection feeling sleepy not sleeping well More serious side effects of the PCV vaccine are rare, and include: high temperature, possibly leading to convulsions (febrile seizures) allergic itchy skin rash Side effects of the pneumococcal vaccine in adults and older children Mild side effects of the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) – the version of the pneumococcal vaccine given to adults and children over the age of two – include: mild soreness or hardness at the site of the injection lasting one to three days a slightly raised temperature There are no serious side effects of the PPV version of the pneumo jab, apart from a serious allergic reaction. What to do if your child is unwell after pneumococcal vaccination Most common side effects in babies and young children, such as swelling or redness at the injection site, usually pass within a couple of days and you don''t need to do anything about them. If your child develops a fever, keep them cool. Make sure they don''t wear too many layers of clothes or blankets, and give them cool drinks. You can also give them a dose of infant paracetamol or ibuprofen liquid according to the instructions on the bottle. Read an NHS leaflet about the common side effects of vaccination that may occur in babies and children (PDF, 118kb) under the age of five, and how to treat them. Allergic reactions to the pneumo jab Very occasionally, a child or adult may have a serious allergic reaction after either type of pneumococcal vaccination. Known as an anaphylactic reaction, this can cause life-threatening breathing difficulties and collapse.  Anaphylaxis is a serious side effect that happens within minutes of the injection. It''s very alarming at the time, but it can be treated with adrenaline. The doctor or nurse giving the vaccine will have been trained to know how to treat anaphylactic reactions. Provided they receive treatment promptly, children and adults make a complete recovery. Call your GP if you notice any unusual symptoms in your baby or yourself after being vaccinated. Read about vaccine safety and side effects to find out more. Reporting side effects of the pneumococcal vaccine The Yellow Card Scheme allows you to report suspected side effects from any type of medicine you''re taking. It''s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). See the Yellow Card Scheme website for more information.

It''s given as a single injection to protect your baby against five serious childhood diseases:  diphtheria  tetanus  whooping cough (pertussis)  polio  Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) When should babies have the 5-in-1 vaccine? The 5-in-1 vaccine is given three times – when babies are 8, 12 and 16 weeks old. Your baby needs three doses to make sure they develop strong immunity against the five diseases the vaccine protects against. Every time another dose of the vaccine is given, your baby''s immune response increases. How is the 5-in-1 vaccine given? The vaccine is injected into your baby''s thigh. How well does the 5-in-1 vaccine work? The 5-in-1 vaccine works well. It produces very good immunity to diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Hib and polio infections. How safe is the 5-in-1 vaccine? The 5-in-1 vaccine is very safe. It''s inactivated, which means it doesn''t contain any live organisms, so there is no risk of your baby getting the diseases it protects against. The vaccine also has few side effects, although it''s common for babies to be a little irritable afterwards. They may also have a short-lived small bump, redness and swelling at the injection site.  There are two 5-in-1 vaccines that are used in the UK. Either can be given to babies as part of the childhood vaccination programme. Their brand names are Pediacel and Infanrix IPV Hib. Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for Pediacel (PDF, 37.43kb). Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for Infanrix IPV Hib (PDF, 66.7kb). Read more about 5-in-1 vaccine side effects. Can the 5-in-1 be given at the same time as other vaccines? It''s safe for your baby to have the 5-in-1 vaccine at the same time as other vaccines, such as the rotavirus vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine and Men B vaccine. Which babies should not have the 5-in-1 infant vaccine? The vast majority of babies can have the 5-in-1 jab, but there are a few babies who should not have it. They include babies who: are allergic to the vaccine have a fever at the time of the vaccination appointment  have signs of a neurological problem that is getting worse, including poorly controlled epilepsy The vaccine should not be given to babies who have had an anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) to a previous dose of the vaccine, or a reaction to any part of the vaccine that may be present in trace amounts, such as neomycin, streptomycin or polymixin B. There is no need to postpone vaccination if your baby has a minor illness, such as a cough or a cold with no fever. But if your baby is ill with a fever, it''s best to delay vaccination until they have recovered. Children who show signs of a neurological problem that is getting worse, including poorly controlled epilepsy, should have their vaccination postponed until they have been seen by a specialist. If your child has a history of febrile convulsions (fits) or has suffered a fit within 72 hours of a previous dose of the vaccine, speak to your GP, nurse or health visitor. They will advise you about what to do. What if I miss the 5-in-1 vaccination appointment? It''s best for babies to be vaccinated at the recommended age, as they are then protected from serious diseases as early in life as possible. However, don''t worry if your baby has missed an appointment for the 5-in-1 vaccination. It''s never too late to have it. Make an appointment with your GP surgery or local child health clinic.

What is a care plan? A care plan (sometimes called a care and support plan, or support plan if you''re a carer) sets out how your care and support needs will be met. You should be fully involved in the preparation of your care plan, and you and anyone else you request should also get a written copy. The care plan must set out: the needs identified by the assessment whether, and to what extent, the needs meet the eligibility criteria the needs that the authority is going to meet, and how it intends to do so for a person needing care, for which of the desired outcomes care and support could be relevant for a carer, the outcomes the carer wishes to achieve, and their wishes around providing care, work, education and recreation where support could be relevant the personal budget information and advice on what can be done to reduce the needs in question, and to prevent or delay the development of needs in the future where needs are being met via a direct payment, the needs to be met via the direct payment and the amount and frequency of the payments Your care plan should be individual to you, and you should be allowed to have as much involvement in the development of your plan as you wish. Care and support should help you to: live independently  have as much control over your life as possible  participate in society on an equal level, with access to employment and a family life  have the best possible quality of life  keep as much dignity and respect as possible It’s worth remembering that if there are different options that would meet your assessed needs equally well, the local authority can choose what it believes are the most cost-effective options. Reviews of your care plan Your care plan should be reviewed by social services within the first three months, and then at least annually. The review looks at whether the outcomes identified in the care plan are being met. It should also review these goals to make sure they’re still appropriate (and for instance, that your care and support needs haven’t changed), and check that any risk assessments are up to date. If, after the review, it is clear that things have changed that affect the detail within the care plan, then the local authority will conduct a revision of the plan. This may also involve a needs assessment and financial assessment. If it’s decided that you no longer qualify for local authority support, you should receive written reasons for this, with information about other help available, including funding your own care. Challenging your care plan If you’re not happy with a care plan, the services provided, or the way an assessment was carried out, you will need to use the local authority''s complaints process. It can sometimes be helpful to get support when you’re making a complaint. Sources of help can include an advocacy organisation.

This is known as being a "self-funder". The cost of your care will vary depending on its type, intensity, specialisation, location and duration. For example, a place in a residential care home will cost hundreds of pounds a week. To make decisions that have such major financial implications, you may want to seek independent financial advice and it’s always worth researching the costs of alternatives first. For example, if you are considering a care home place, the cost should be weighed against the cost of care and support that may help you remain in your current home, such as homecare. How much will care cost? If you are thinking about your future care needs or are facing immediate decisions about care options, it can be helpful to get an idea how much care can cost. Inevitably, the price you would pay will depend on your particular circumstances and needs. The costs also vary depending on where you live. Unfortunately, care homes and homecare agencies tend not to provide this information publicly but you may find it helpful to search for and contact care services in your area to get some idea of likely costs. The ‘cap on care costs’ Currently, it is not easy to plan for your future care needs, as it’s hard to estimate how long you will need care for and how your circumstances may change. From April 2020, a "cap" on the costs of meeting your eligible care needs (but not accommodation associated with care or nursing costs) is being introduced. The cap means that, once reached, the local authority will take over paying the cost of their eligible care needs. The cap will not cover your daily living costs. These costs include expenses such as rent, food and utilities and the costs you would face even if you did not have care needs. It is important to note that daily living costs will be a nationally set figure. This figure will be a "notional" amount rather than the actual costs. This is designed to support consistency and enable people to plan. To benefit from the cap once it comes in, you will need to contact your local authority to see if your needs are eligible. If you are seen to have eligible care needs, the local authority will open a "care account" for you. This account records your progress (the amount of costs you have incurred) towards the cap. The cap does not begin until April 2020 and any costs incurred before this will not count towards the cap.  The BBC’s care calculator can estimate how much you may have to pay for care services depending on where you live in England, once the new rules are in place. This will give you an idea of how the cap will work for you, but actual costs will vary to reflect your individual circumstances and needs and how they change over time. For more information on how paying for care is changing from 2020, read about the changes in the Care Act. Ask for help from your local authority It''s worth checking whether you''re eligible for means-tested support from your local authority or other financial support – for example, through a care needs assessment and a financial assessment. Few of us will have the income or ready access to the cash to pay for our ongoing care needs, and you may need to look at selling or remortgaging any property you may own. The new Care Act means more people may be able to benefit from "deferred payments". Deferred payments can help people avoid being forced to sell their home in a crisis in order to pay for their care by having the council temporarily cover the cost – usually until you sell your property. Following the Care Act, every local authority in England has to make deferred payment agreements available. As an alternative, you may be able to enter an "equity release scheme" with a financial organisation. Equity release can pay for the fees from the value of property you own. However, you should consider which of these options best meets your needs, and what the overall costs to you will be. Before taking such significant financial steps as equity release, you might want to get independent financial advice. You can find information on equity release for care at home from Which? Elderly Care or the Money Advice Service''s equity release information. If you’re planning ahead, you may consider arranging an investment or insurance plan to fund your care. Again, it may be worth taking independent advice on financial arrangements before making major changes. Because of the new rules, there are likely to be more financial products emerging that are designed to help people pay for care. You may also want to explore whether the NHS would meet some or all of your care and support costs, or you may have entitlement to benefits that may help you meet costs. Read about other ways of funding care. Advice on paying for care Even if your local authority is not able to help fund your care, it will be able to make an assessment of your care and support needs. From this, the local authority can provide you with access to a range of information and advice available locally. You can also get independent advice from: The Money Advice Service website: offers information on paying for care or the option to speak to an online adviser. You can call the Money Advice Service on 0300 500 5000. The Society of Later Life Advisers: the society can also help you find advice on how to make financial plans for care in your old age. Find Me Good Care: a website of the Social Care Institute for Excellence. It has advice on all aspects of planning and funding social care. Age UK: has great advice for older people and those planning for their later years. Carers UK: an excellent resource of advice for carers who need to help someone else. Which? Elderly Care has a guide to financing care. Deferred payments if you are unable to pay for care services Care home fees are a big financial commitment, and the decision to go into a care home is often made at a moment of crisis or urgency, such as when being discharged from hospital. This can make finding the money to pay for fees (usually several hundred pounds a week) challenging for people funding their own care. In particular, if you own property outright but have little in the way of savings, you may be expected to fund your own care but have little immediately available money to pay for it. Some people going to stay in a care home for a long time find that they have no option but to sell their property to pay the care home fees. Your council may be able to help you if you are at risk of having to sell your home. Where there is a delay in selling the property, or you don’t want to sell the property immediately, you may be eligible to have your care fee payment "deferred". This is where the local authority helps you to pay your care fees temporarily, and you repay the costs to the local authority at a later date. If the local authority agrees to the deferred payment and pays the care home fees, it will take payment from the money raised once the property is sold. This can be: during your lifetime if you choose to sell your home once you die, the local authority can be repaid from your estate  All councils must offer people the chance to defer payment if they meet a set of eligibility criteria. A deferred payment scheme is only available if you don''t have enough income to cover your care home fees, and you have less in savings than £23,250. In these circumstances, the savings don''t include the value of your property, but does include money in bank accounts. The local authority will put a "legal charge" (similar to a mortgage) on the property and will then pay the remaining care fees in full. You will then be assessed to see whether they are able to pay a weekly charge to the authority. Your ability to pay is based on your income less a set "disposable income allowance" (currently £144 per week). Before considering deferred payments, you should look into whether the property will or won''t be counted in how your capital is calculated. For instance, it may be disregarded because your partner still lives there, and if it is a deferred payment agreement wouldn''t be necessary. It''s wise to get independent financial advice before agreeing to a deferred payment, and it’s worth bearing in mind that choosing deferred payments can impact on some welfare benefits. Protection for self-funders While you may have the savings in place to afford care services, if you lack the capacity to make the arrangements, the local authority can step in to help. The local authority can also help people who lack capacity by negotiating fees with a care provider and paying them directly. The local authority will need to be reimbursed. Anyone entering into a contract for care services should be given adequate information about the fees. Care providers should supply: information about the fees charged for various services provided arrangements for paying the fees the fees charged for any additional services If your capital falls below the set levels for local authority funding (currently £23,250), you will be eligible for reassessment for help with funding your care.

Here''s what to do in the event of a measles outbreak near you. If your children haven''t yet had their routine MMR vaccination, don''t delay. There were more than 800 confirmed cases of measles – including one death – in the 2013 measles outbreak in Swansea, and there could be similar measles outbreaks in the future. Why is it so important to be vaccinated against measles? Measles isn''t trivial. It''s a very infectious, nasty illness that, in rare cases, can be fatal. About one in five children with measles experiences complications such as ear infections, diarrhoea and vomiting, pneumonia, meningitis, and eye disorders. One in 10 children with measles end up in hospital. There is no treatment for the disease. Vaccination is the only way of preventing it. How easy is it to catch measles? Measles spreads very easily. In fact, it''s one of the most infectious diseases known. You can catch measles if you spend just 15 minutes with someone who has the disease. Read more about measles and the MMR vaccination. Can adults catch measles? Yes. And adults are likely to be more ill than children and for longer. Someone with measles generally has to spend five days in bed and be off work for 10 days. Adults are also more prone to measles complications than children. Measles cases in England and Wales and MMR uptake rate in England 1998-2012 We live a long way from the outbreak, so should I be worried? Outbreaks of measles can happen anywhere at any time – wherever you live in the UK, it''s important that your children are up to date with their MMR and other childhood vaccinations. If your child has already had two doses of MMR vaccine, you don''t need to worry. Similarly, if your child had their first dose of MMR as a baby, but they are not yet old enough to have received their second dose, they are up to date and there is no need to have the second MMR dose earlier than scheduled. However, if your child is school-age and has only had one MMR dose, or has not been vaccinated at all, they should be vaccinated as soon as possible. Find out which vaccinations are available on the NHS. What if I''m going close to an area with an outbreak? If you have plans to travel to an area where there has been an outbreak of measles, make immediate arrangements with your GP for your children to receive the MMR vaccination if they haven''t had both doses before. Babies and young children can have doses of the vaccination earlier or closer together than usual in special circumstances. Can my children still have the MMR vaccination if they weren''t vaccinated as babies? Yes. It''s never too late for your children (or yourself) to "catch up" with MMR vaccination if they missed it earlier. Children up to the age of 18 and adults without immunity should have a catch-up MMR vaccination. Can a baby under six months have the MMR vaccine? No. Babies under six months usually have some antibodies to measles already in their system passed on from their mum at birth, which may give them some protection for the first few months. But this residual immunity also interferes with their response to the MMR vaccine. So, the best approach for children under six months is to try to avoid them having any contact with measles. It''s also a good idea to make sure the rest of your family have had the MMR jab, especially if you are planning to visit an outbreak area, as the greatest risk is in the household. I''m not sure if my kids are already vaccinated. How do I find out? MMR vaccination is usually given as a first dose around the age of 13 months and again as a "booster" jab before school between the ages of three and five. If your child has already had the vaccine, it should be recorded in their medical notes and in their personal health record (the Red Book). Ask your GP or practice manager if you''re not sure. Find your local GP. What do I do if my GP isn''t sure if my family has been vaccinated? If you or your GP are unsure whether your children have been vaccinated against measles before, go ahead and arrange to have your kids vaccinated again. It won''t hurt them to have the MMR vaccination a second or third time. Will I have to pay for the MMR vaccination? No. MMR vaccination is available to adults and children free on the NHS. Can you still get measles after the MMR vaccination? It''s extremely unlikely, but you need two doses of MMR to be fully protected. The first dose of the MMR jab protects 90% of those who receive it, and the second dose tops this up to 99% protection. How do I arrange vaccination? Simply call your local GP practice and make an appointment for an MMR jab. It involves two doses, which can be given just a month apart to give protection as quickly as possible. If you aren''t registered with a GP, find the nearest doctor''s surgery, who will give your family the jabs.  Read more about how the MMR jab is given. Can adults have the MMR jab? It''s not just children who can benefit from MMR vaccination. Adults who are unsure whether they''ve had measles or been vaccinated – particularly if they''re carers or work with children – can have the MMR vaccine on the NHS from their GP. Bear in mind that most adults born before 1970 are likely to be immune because they have probably been exposed to measles already.

The Care Act and what it means for me Media last reviewed: 30/09/2015 Next review due: 30/09/2017 Your carer''s assessment may identify that you need a break from caring from time to time. Equally, the person you care for may also want to have a break without you. See Accessible day trips and activities for help planning their trip. Replacement care and respite care Replacement care is designed to replace the care that you, as a carer, would normally be giving the person you care for. It may be needed so you can look after your own health and wellbeing, and to take a break from caring. For example, it may be that regular replacement overnight care is needed so you can catch up on your own sleep. In certain situations, respite (temporary) care may be provided by your local authority after your carer''s assessment or after the person you care for has had an assessment. You can use the directory of local carers'' services to find your nearest local carers'' centre or respite service. Your local authority or local carers'' centre can give you information about local support. Carer''s tip from Scope "Some hospices provide respite care; we have found this very helpful. They offer high-level care, which means you can feel comfortable your family member is being cared for properly." Breaks for carers After your carer''s assessment, you may agree with your local authority that you need a break as part of your support plan. If the local authority has agreed to fund the breaks in your care plan, you should be able to choose how you can get your break. Using direct payments to get time off caring After your assessment, if you are eligible for support, your local authority will develop a support plan with you. This will include a personal budget, which you can choose to have as a direct payment. For example, you may choose to:  hire a care worker through an agency so you can go on a shopping trip use the direct payment to pay for a supported holiday for both you and the person you care for – the Short Breaks Network can provide more information on this Alternatives to direct payments You may also want to consider funding or getting a break from caring by: asking for care organised by your local authority getting funding from a benevolent fund or charity paying for a break yourself accessing bursaries and low-cost holidays getting leisure discounts asking friends and family to help Replacement care provided by the local authority Instead of a direct payment, you could ask the local authority to arrange services for you so you can have a break. You can also use a direct payment to fund traditional forms of respite care, and you can pool your direct payments with other people''s to fund services such as day centres. Some local authorities provide vouchers (sometimes called respite grants, or carers'' grants) that can be exchanged for services, such as those offered by care agencies or residential homes. You might be able to use vouchers to pay for extra costs associated with your holiday, including live-in care workers, short-stay residential care, or the cost of more homecare. You might want to consider: homecare services – these can either be day services that give you the chance to do an activity inside or outside the home, or night services that can help you get a proper night''s sleep, or helpers coming to the home of the person you''re caring for. Different types of help can be organised, including sitting with the person you care for and keeping them company, preparing meals, and helping them to get up, washed and dressed. The care workers who come to your home can also provide social activities, such as taking the person you care for to the cinema, pub or shopping. residential or nursing care – this is where the person you''re looking after goes for a short stay in a residential or nursing home. If you can, visit the care or nursing home beforehand so you can see what it''s like.  day care – this is where the person you''re looking after goes to a day centre or takes part in activities away from home. If the replacement care provided is essentially a homecare service for the person needing care and allows you to take a break, it should be considered a service provided to the cared-for person and should therefore be charged to them, not you as the carer. Find out more in Carer''s assessment. Benevolent funds or charity funding You may be able to get help with the cost of going on holiday – either alone or with the person you care for – from a charity or benevolent fund. Your social worker, GP, health visitor or local carers'' support group can give you more information on local benevolent funds and other possible sources of funding. You might find help from the following: Saga Respite for Carers Trust provides a limited number of free holidays each year for carers over the age of 50 and the people they look after. The Family Fund can provide grants towards the cost of holidays for families on a low income who are caring for a child with a severe disability. The Family Holiday Association is a UK charity providing breaks at holiday sites, or grants to help with the cost of a holiday, to low-income families in need of a holiday away from home. You need to be referred by your social worker, GP or health visitor, or by a charity or other welfare agent. The Children''s Country Holiday Fund provides respite breaks in the countryside for young carers aged 6 to 16 and disadvantaged children and young people. Paying for your own breaks If after a carer''s assessment the local authority decides it will not fund a break for you, you can still decide to pay for your own break from caring. How you go about this will depend on your budget and the care options available to you locally. Bursaries and low-cost holidays Some charities offer low-cost holidays or bursaries to families. The national charity Diabetes UK offers support holidays for families and young people. Holidays are low cost and a bursary can be offered to families who can''t afford the travel costs to the UK holiday site. Further information can be found on the Diabetes UK website or on 020 7424 1000 (ask for the care support team). Turn2us, an independent charity, can help you find sources of financial support based on your particular needs and circumstances. Saga, the organisation for people aged 50 and older, has a range of holidays and short breaks to suit carers, including group holidays, holidays for single travellers, special interest holidays, and cruises. Holidays are run throughout the year in the UK and abroad. Saga also offers free holidays for carers through the Saga Respite for Carers Trust. Leisure discounts Many local authorities offer leisure cards. These can help you pay for activities you might like to do when you get a break from caring. They''re often available to people claiming benefits such as Income Support, Employment and Support Allowance, Carer''s Allowance and benefits for disabled people, students over 18 in full-time education, and people over 60. The eligibility requirements vary between areas, but there''s a good chance you''ll qualify if you''re a carer with a low income. Local authorities might make a small annual charge for the card, from £1 up to around £15. You''ll probably be asked for some proof of your entitlement, such as a statement of entitlement for Income Support or an official letter. Discount leisure cards can give you discounts of between 10 and 50% on activities, services and entertainment. These range from sporting activities at local leisure centres to cinemas, theatres, libraries, museums, hairdressers and beauty salons. Help with caring from friends and family Friends and family can provide support for you and the person you care for, especially when you need a break from caring. However, they are not the same as paid professional care workers, and regular caring can place the same stresses on them as on you. They may also be unable or unwilling to commit to giving you a break when you need it. Make sure anyone who takes over from you has all the information they need to look after the person you care for. This may include what they like to eat and at what time, as well as more complex information about the medicines they need to take. Leave a clear list of contacts. These should include the doctor''s number, those of nearby family members and friends, and your own number in case of emergencies. If you have an emergency plan, go through it with the people who will be providing replacement care. If the person you care for needs specialist medical or nursing help while you''re away, arrange this through their GP. This specialist help can include visits from a district nurse or from a community psychiatric nurse. There is no charge for this healthcare, but each NHS body decides what care it will provide. Help with emergency planning Thinking about what you would do in an emergency should be part of the discussion you have as part of your carer''s assessment. The person who carries out your assessment should be able to help you with planning. Carer''s tip from Scope "It might be a good idea to choose someone from your family to be the person''s guardian in case of death. You should ensure that person is familiar, and keep them up-to-date with needs." To create an emergency plan, you will need to note down details of: the name, address and any other contact details of the person you look after who you and the person you look after would like to be contacted in an emergency – this could be friends, family or professional people involved in the person''s care any medication the person is taking any ongoing treatment they need You can register with a carers emergency scheme in your area. If you do, a skilled worker trained to look at your individual situation may be able to help you make your emergency plans. Who can help make an emergency plan? Every carer who has an assessment should be asked about emergencies and offered help to plan for them. The social worker involved in your carer''s assessment should be able to help you with emergency planning.

Do you need to have the shingles vaccination every year? Will there be any side effects from the shingles vaccination? What about people who aren''t yet 70?

Which people shouldn''t have the shingles vaccine? Will the shingles vaccine stop me getting shingles?  Do I need the shingles vaccine if I''ve never had chickenpox?  Should I have the shingles vaccine if I''ve already had shingles? Can I get the shingles vaccine privately?   What is shingles? Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a painful skin rash caused by the chickenpox virus (varicella-zoster virus). Read more about shingles. How do you catch shingles? You don''t "catch" shingles – it comes on when there''s a reactivation of chickenpox virus that''s already in your body. After you''ve recovered from chickenpox the varicella-zoster virus lies dormant in your nerve cells and can reactivate at a later stage when your immune system is weakened. Anyone who has had chickenpox can get shingles. Is shingles serious? Yes, it can be. Not only can shingles be very painful and uncomfortable, some people are left with long-lasting pain called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) for years after the initial rash has healed. Very occasionally, shingles can be fatal. How common is shingles? Around one in five people who have had chickenpox (usually in childhood) go on to develop shingles. That means that tens of thousands of people in England and Wales will get shingles each year. How is the shingles vaccine given? It''s given as an injection into the upper arm. Who will be able to have the shingles vaccination? It is available to all 70-year-olds and, until the last day of August 2017, to 78-year olds too. People who were eligible for immunisation in the first three years of the programme but have not yet been vaccinated against shingles also remain eligible until their 80th birthday. These are people: aged 71, 72 and 73 on 1 September 2016 aged 79 on 1 September 2016 Anyone aged 80 and over is unsuitable to have the shingles vaccination on the NHS because it seems to be less effective in this age group.   Read more about who can have the shingles vaccine. How do I get the shingles vaccination? You don''t need to do anything. Your GP will invite you to the surgery for the vaccination. You can have it at the same time as your flu jab in the autumn if you wish. Do you need to have the shingles vaccination every year? No, it''s a one-off single injection. Will there be any side effects from the shingles vaccination? It''s quite common to get redness and discomfort at the vaccination site as well as headaches, but these side effects shouldn''t last more than a few days. See your GP if you have side effects that last longer than a few days, or if you develop a rash after having the shingles vaccination. Read more about the side effects of the shingles vaccine. What about people who aren''t yet 70? Will they get the shingles vaccine? People under the age of 70 will get the shingles vaccine during the year following their 70th birthday. It''s not available on the NHS to younger people, because shingles is more common in the over-70s. What about people aged 74 to 77. Can they have the vaccine? Not at the moment. The shingles vaccine is available on the NHS only for people aged 70 and 78 on 1 September 2016 (and to people aged 71, 72, 73 or 79 who haven''t been vaccinated yet). The shingles vaccination programme is being staggered this way as it would be impractical to vaccinate everyone in their 70s in a single year. Why can''t I have the shingles vaccination if I''m over 80? The vaccine doesn''t work as well in people over the age of 80. Which people shouldn''t have the shingles vaccine? You shouldn''t have the shingles vaccine if: you''ve had a serious allergic reaction, such as an anaphylactic reaction, in the past to any of its ingredients, such as neomycin (your GP can tell you if this applies to you) you have a weakened immune system (again, your GP can advise you) Will the shingles vaccine stop me getting shingles? It won''t guarantee that you won''t get shingles, but it will reduce your chances. And, if you do get shingles, the vaccine will likely make the symptoms milder and the illness shorter. You''ll also be less likely to get shingles complications such as postherpetic neuralgia. Do I need the shingles vaccine if I''ve never had chickenpox? Yes. The chances are that you have had chickenpox at some point without knowing it. Some people have chickenpox without displaying any of the typical chickenpox symptoms like rash. Should I have the shingles vaccine if I''ve already had shingles? Yes. The shingles vaccine works very well in people who have had shingles before to boost your immunity against further shingles attacks. Can I get the shingles vaccine privately? The shingles jab is available privately for anyone over the age of 50. It''s expensive and in very short supply, though. Expect to pay between £100 and £200. Your GP can advise on whether it''s safe for you to have, but you may need to visit a private clinic to arrange this.   Page last reviewed: 28/07/2015 Next review due: 28/07/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

(159, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/mmr-vaccine-when-needed.aspx', 'Who should have the MMR vaccine?', 'When do you need the MMR vaccine? - Vaccinations - NHS Choices', '', 'MMR vaccination is routinely given to children as part of the NHS childhood immunisation programme. It can also be given on the NHS to older children and adults, and babies over six months of age, who need to be protected against measles, mumps and rubella, or in the event of a measles outbreak.  Which children should have the MMR vaccine? The first dose of the MMR vaccine is offered to all babies at one year old. Children are given a second dose of MMR before they start school, usually at 3 years and 4 months, although the second dose can be given as quickly as three months after the first if there''s an urgent need, such as in an outbreak. Some children who only have one dose of MMR may not be fully protected against measles, mumps and rubella. Up to 1 in 10 children are not fully immune after their first dose of MMR, but less than 1 in 100 children are still at risk after the second dose. Which children should not have the MMR vaccine? You should postpone your child''s MMR jab if they''re ill and have a high temperature (fever). If your child has a minor illness without fever, they can usually have vaccinations. You may also want to postpone MMR vaccination if your child has had a bad reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine. It doesn''t rule out having a further dose, but it''s a good idea to speak to your GP, practice nurse or health visitor. Your child should not have the MMR vaccination if they: are taking high-dose steroid tablets, or are taking lower doses either alongside other drugs or over a long time – if you''re not sure, check with your GP have had a confirmed anaphylactic reaction (a severe allergic reaction) to a previous dose of the MMR vaccine or a component of it are being treated for cancer with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or have had these treatments within the last six months have had an organ transplant and are on immunosuppressant drugs (drugs that stop your immune system working properly) have had a bone marrow transplant and finished all immunosuppressive therapy within the last 12 months have a lowered immune system – if you''re not sure, check with your GP Catching up on the MMR vaccine Adults and children who are not immune because they missed one or all MMR doses when they were younger can have the MMR vaccine on the NHS at any age. This may include: teenagers adults travellers women preparing for pregnancy people exposed to measles during a measles outbreak Read the NHS leaflet: measles - not just a kids'' problem (PDF, 868kb). Teenagers and MMR Teenagers attending for their 3-in-1 teenage booster are generally asked about their MMR vaccination history. If they missed one or both doses of MMR vaccine when they were younger, they can be given two doses of MMR vaccine on the NHS to protect them. It''s especially important for teenagers leaving home for college to be up-to-date with the MMR vaccine as they are at higher risk of mumps. Find out why it''s important for teenagers to be protected against mumps. Adults and MMR Adults who missed out on the MMR vaccination as a baby and are therefore not immune can have the MMR vaccine on the NHS. It''s given to adults as two doses, with the second dose given at least a month after the first. Some adults may not have received full protection because of changes in the MMR vaccine. Anyone born between 1980 and 1990 may not have received a mumps vaccine, and anyone born between 1970 and 1979 may have only had a measles vaccine. If you fall into one of these groups, ask your GP for the MMR vaccination. Travellers and MMR Anyone who is travelling to an area known to have had outbreaks of measles, mumps or rubella should receive the MMR vaccine before they travel. Learn more about travel vaccinations. Pregnancy and the MMR vaccine If you''re thinking of having a baby If you''re considering becoming pregnant, it''s a good idea to check that you''re fully protected against measles, mumps and rubella.  Rubella infection in pregnancy can lead to serious birth defects and miscarriage.  If you''re not sure you''ve had two doses of the MMR vaccine, ask your GP practice to check. If you haven''t had both doses or there''s no record available, you can have the vaccinations at your GP practice. You should avoid becoming pregnant for one month after having MMR vaccination. If you''re already pregnant The MMR vaccine cannot be given while you''re pregnant, but it can be given when you''re breastfeeding. If you''re currently pregnant and you''re not sure whether you''ve had two doses of MMR, ask your GP practice to check your records. If you haven''t had two doses of the MMR vaccine or there''s no record available, you should ask for the vaccine when you go for your six-week postnatal check-up after the birth. This will protect you from rubella in any future pregnancies. If you''re pregnant and develop a rash or come into contact with anyone who has a rash, you should contact your GP or midwife immediately – even if you''ve had two doses of the MMR vaccine. MMR during measles outbreaks In the event of a measles outbreak, the MMR vaccine can be given to protect people who have come into contact with the condition in the previous three days. This is because measles antibodies develop more quickly after vaccination than they do after a natural infection. It isn''t harmful to have an MMR vaccination if you''re already immune. So, if there is any doubt about whether you have already been vaccinated, go ahead and ask your GP for a catch-up vaccination. Now, read about how the MMR vaccination is given. Which adults should not have the MMR vaccine? Very few people are unable to have the MMR vaccine for medical reasons. However, as a general rule, you should not have the MMR vaccine if you: are pregnant – women should avoid becoming pregnant for one month after having the MMR vaccine have had an injection of immunoglobulin (antibodies to help fight infection) or another blood product in the previous three months have already had a severe allergic reaction to neomycin (an antibiotic) or gelatin (a substance used in foods such as jelly) have a weakened immune system  If you previously had an allergic reaction to the MMR vaccine, you may not be able to have another dose. You can discuss the risks of not having the full dose of MMR with a specialist, versus the likelihood and potential severity of having another allergic reaction if you choose to have another dose.

Eligibility for NHS continuing healthcare NHS continuing healthcare assessments Care and support planning Refunds for delays in NHS continuing healthcare funding If you are not eligible for NHS continuing healthcare Frequently asked questions Where can NHS continuing healthcare be provided? NHS continuing healthcare can be provided in a variety of settings outside hospital, such as in your home or in a registered care home.  Eligibility for NHS continuing healthcare NHS continuing healthcare is for adults. Children and young people may receive a ''continuing care package'' if they have needs arising from disability, accident or illness that can''t be met by existing universal or specialist services alone. Find out more about continuing care for children and young people (PDF, 560kb). To be eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, you must be assessed by a team of healthcare professionals (a "multi-disciplinary team") as having a "primary health need". Whether or not someone has a primary health need is assessed by looking at all their care needs and relating them to: what help is needed how complex these needs are how intense or severe these needs can be how unpredictable they are, including any risks to the person''s health if the right care isn''t provided at the right time Your eligibility for NHS continuing healthcare depends on your assessed needs, and not on any particular diagnosis or condition. If your needs change then your eligibility for NHS continuing healthcare may change. You should be fully involved in the assessment process and kept informed, and have your views about your needs and support taken into account. Carers and family members should also be consulted where appropriate. A decision about eligibility should usually be made within 28 days of it being decided that the person needs a full assessment for NHS continuing healthcare. If you aren''t eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, you can be referred to your local authority who can discuss with you whether you may be eligible for support from them. If you still have some health needs then the NHS may still pay for part of the package of support. This is sometimes known as a "joint package" of care. NHS continuing healthcare assessments Clinical commissioning groups, known as CCGs (the NHS organisations that commission local health services), must assess you for NHS continuing healthcare if it seems that you may need it. For most people, there is an initial checklist assessment, which is used to decide if you need a full assessment. However, if you need care urgently – for example, if you’re terminally ill – your assessment may be fast-tracked. Initial assessment for NHS continuing healthcare The initial checklist assessment can be completed by a nurse, doctor, other healthcare professional or social worker. You should be told that you’re being assessed, and be asked for your consent. Depending on the outcome of the checklist, you will either be told that you don''t meet the criteria for a full assessment of NHS continuing healthcare and are therefore not eligible, or you will be referred for a full assessment of eligibility. Being referred for a full assessment doesn’t necessarily mean that you will be eligible for NHS continuing healthcare. The purpose of the checklist is to enable anyone who might be eligible to have the opportunity for a full assessment. The professional(s) completing the checklist should record written reasons for their decision, and sign and date the checklist. You should be given a copy of the completed checklist. You can download a blank copy of the NHS continuing healthcare checklist from GOV.UK (PDF, 168kb). Full assessments for NHS continuing healthcare are undertaken by a "multi-disciplinary" team made up of a minimum of two health or care professionals who are already involved in your care. You should be informed who is co-ordinating the NHS continuing healthcare assessment. The team’s assessment will consider your needs under the following headings: behaviour cognition (understanding) communication psychological/emotional needs mobility nutrition (food and drink) continence skin (including wounds and ulcers) breathing symptom control through drug therapies and medication altered states of consciousness other significant needs These needs are then given a weighting marked "priority", "severe", "high", "moderate", "low" or "no needs". The multi-disciplinary team will consider: what help is needed how complex these needs are how intense or severe these needs can be how unpredictable they are, including any risks to the person''s health if the right care isn''t provided at the right time If you have at least one priority need, or severe needs in at least two areas, you should be eligible for NHS continuing healthcare. You may also be eligible if you have a severe need in one area plus a number of other needs, or a number of high or moderate needs, depending on their nature, intensity, complexity or unpredictability. In all cases, the overall need, and interactions between needs, will be taken into account, together with evidence from risk assessments, in deciding whether NHS continuing healthcare should be provided. The assessment should take into account your views and the views of any carers you have. You should be given a copy of the decision documents, along with clear reasons for the decision. You can download a blank copy of the NHS continuing healthcare decision support tool. Fast-track assessment for NHS continuing healthcare If someone’s condition is deteriorating quickly and they are nearing the end of their life, they should be considered for the NHS continuing healthcare fast track pathway, so that an appropriate care and support package can be put in place as soon as possible – usually within 48 hours. Care and support planning If you are eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, the next stage is to arrange a care and support package which meets your assessed needs. Depending on your situation, different options could be suitable, including support in your own home and the option of a personal health budget. If it is agreed that a care home is the best option for you, there could be more than one local care home that is suitable. Your CCG should work collaboratively with you and consider your views when agreeing your care and support package and the setting where it will be provided. However, they can also take other factors, such as the cost and value for money of different options, into account. NHS continuing healthcare reviews If you are eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, your needs and support package should normally be reviewed within three months and thereafter at least annually. This review will consider whether your existing care and support package meets your assessed needs. If your needs have changed, the review will also consider whether you are still eligible for NHS continuing healthcare. Refunds for delays in NHS continuing healthcare funding CCGs should normally make a decision about eligibility for NHS continuing healthcare within 28 days of getting a completed checklist or request for a full assessment, unless there are circumstances beyond its control. If the CCG decides that you are eligible, but takes longer than 28 days to decide this, and the delay is unjustifiable, they should refund any care costs from the 29th day until the date of their decision. If your CCG decided that you weren’t eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, but then revised this decision after a dispute, it should refund your care costs for the period between their original decision and their revised decision. If you are not eligible for NHS continuing healthcare If you are not eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, but you are assessed as requiring nursing care in a care home (in other words, a care home that is registered to provide nursing care) you will be eligible for NHS-funded nursing care. This means that the NHS will pay a contribution towards the cost of your registered nursing care. This is known as NHS-funding nursing care and is available irrespective of who is funding the rest of the care home fees. NHS England has issued guidance on how people can be compensated following eligibility disputes and delays in receiving NHS continuing healthcare (PDF, 496kb). Frequently asked questions about NHS continuing healthcare I have a local authority support package that works well. I am now eligible for NHS continuing healthcare – will my support package change? If you are concerned about changes to your care package because of a move to NHS continuing healthcare, your CCG should talk to you about ways that it can give you as much choice and control as possible. This could include the use of a personal health budget, with one option being a ''direct payment for healthcare''. Find out about choice in the NHS and personal health budgets. If you’re still not satisfied, you may want to complain. Can someone refuse an assessment for NHS continuing healthcare? If they do refuse, will they be able to get services from their local authority? An assessment for NHS continuing healthcare can’t be carried out without someone’s consent, so it is possible to refuse. However, if they do refuse, although they will still be entitled to an assessment by the local authority there is no guarantee that they will be provided with services. This is because there is a legal limit on the type of services that a local authority can provide. If you refuse to be assessed for NHS continuing healthcare, the CCG should explore your reasons for refusing, and try to address your concerns. If someone lacks the mental capacity to consent to or refuse an assessment, the principles of the Mental Capacity Act will apply and in most circumstances an assessment will be provided in the person''s best interest. My relative is in a care home and has become eligible for NHS continuing healthcare. The CCG says the fees charged by this care home are more than they would usually pay, and has proposed a move to a different care home. I think a move will have a negative effect on my relative. What can we do? If there is evidence that a move is likely to have a significantly detrimental effect on your relative''s health or wellbeing, you should discuss this with the CCG who will take your concerns into account when considering the most appropriate arrangements. If the CCG decides to arrange an alternative placement, they should make efforts to provide a reasonable choice of homes. Is it possible to pay top-up fees for NHS continuing healthcare? No, it is not possible to top up NHS continuing healthcare packages, like you can with local authority care packages. The only way that NHS continuing healthcare packages can be topped up privately is if you pay for additional private services on top of the services you get from the NHS. These private services should be provided by different staff and preferably in a different setting.

It’s particularly important for someone who is recovering from an illness. Eating only a limited diet or not getting enough food can lead to malnutrition. Malnutrition can be caused by: some diseases, such as cancer some medications, which can interfere with the body''s ability to absorb nutrients problems with dentures making eating difficult problems with swallowing (dysphagia) and chewing due to neurological conditions lack of appetite loss of smell (anosmia) or taste depression If someone isn’t getting enough nutrients they may not respond well to medical treatment. If you are a carer try to encourage good nutrition and hydration, and make meal times enjoyable for the person you care for. Basing meals and snacks on foods that are high in energy and protein may help. These include: meat, oily fish, eggs, nuts, full fat dairy, such as yoghurt or cheese. Offer small frequent meals and snacks every two to three hours. Warm milky drinks can also help to bump up nutrients and calories. Avoiding dehydration It’s recommended that adults drink the equivalent of six to eight glasses of fluid every day. It’s important to have access to water and other drinks throughout the day. But if your appetite is poor, avoid too many drinks just before meals. Read more about water and drinks. Plan your mealtimes Try to include favourite types of food in a weekly meal plan. If you’re a carer, make meal times a fun and social occasion by sitting down at the table and eating together. Get more tips on food and diet. Specific nutritional needs Carers also need to be aware of any difficulties the person you care for may have that will affect the type of food they can eat. For example, they may have food allergies or have diabetes. Do speak to their GP if you are not sure what their nutritional needs are. Support with eating and drinking If someone struggles with cups or cutlery there is specialist equipment, such as no-spill cups and easy-to-handle knives and forks, available to help. Mention this difficulty at the community care assessment to see if any help is available from social services. The website Living made easy, run by the Disabled Living Foundation, has information about the different types of eating and drinking aids available. Swallowing difficulties Anyone who has difficulty swallowing their food should contact their GP, who may refer to a specialist for help. For some conditions, this specialist help may include nutritional supplements or alternative feeding methods, such as a nasogastric tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, which is surgically implanted into the stomach. Read more about malnutrition treatment. ‘Meals on wheels’ If you can’t shop for, prepare or cook a meal, then the council may be able to help you by delivering ready meals to you at home. This is commonly known as ‘meals on wheels’, but local authorities often refer to ‘meals at home’ services. Usually a meals on wheels service will provide a hot meal with dessert. Some local authorities provide frozen meals which can then be heated in a microwave, giving you more control over when you eat. There is usually a charge for the meals on wheels service, and the service is usually only offered after the council has looked at whether you need it. The council will give you a ''service agreement'' with details of when you will receive meals, how much they will cost and contact details for the person managing the meals on wheels service. Meals on wheels services generally cater for all types of meal, including: vegetarian soft and puréed meals meals for diabetics low-fat meals gluten-free meals culturally-appropriate menus, such as kosher or halal Page last reviewed: 15/01/2015 Next review due: 15/01/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Why isn''t the chickenpox vaccination part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule? If I want the chickenpox vaccination for my child, can I get it free on the NHS? I''m not sure if I had chickenpox as a child. How can I check? If people in ''at-risk'' groups cannot have the vaccine, what treatments are available if they are exposed to chickenpox? I recently had the chickenpox vaccine and have just found out I''m pregnant. What should I do? Who should have the chickenpox jab? Chickenpox vaccination is not part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. It''s only offered to individuals who are likely to come into contact with people who are particularly vulnerable to chickenpox, such as those having chemotherapy. This reduces the risk of chickenpox spreading to vulnerable people. Read more about who should have the chickenpox vaccine. Why isn''t the chickenpox vaccination part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule? There''s a worry that introducing chickenpox vaccination for all children could increase the risk of chickenpox and shingles in adults. While chickenpox during childhood is unpleasant, the vast majority of children recover quickly and easily. In adults, chickenpox is more severe and the risk of complications increases with age.  If a childhood chickenpox vaccination programme was introduced, people would not catch chickenpox as children because the infection would no longer circulate in areas where the majority of children had been vaccinated. This would leave unvaccinated children susceptible to contracting chickenpox as adults, when they are more likely to develop a more severe infection or a secondary complication, or in pregnancy, when there is a risk of the infection harming the baby. We could also see a significant increase in cases of shingles in adults. Being exposed to chickenpox as an adult – for example, through contact with infected children – boosts your immunity to shingles. If you vaccinate children against chickenpox, you lose this natural boosting, so immunity in adults will drop and more shingles cases will occur. If I want the chickenpox vaccine for my child, can I get it free on the NHS? Chickenpox vaccinations are provided free on the NHS where there is a clinical need, such as for healthy people who aren''t immune to chickenpox and are in close contact with someone who has a weakened immune system. This is to reduce the risk of the person with a weakened immune system catching chickenpox and then developing serious chickenpox complications. Examples of children who would probably be eligible for a chickenpox jab on the NHS include the brothers and sisters of a child with leukaemia, or a child whose parent is undergoing chemotherapy. You cannot get the chickenpox vaccine free on the NHS if you simply want to prevent your child catching chickenpox and there are no other associated health risks. A number of private travel clinics offer chickenpox vaccinations. I''m not sure if I had chickenpox as a child. How can I check? The first thing you can do is ask your parents. If you spent your childhood in England it is very likely that you had chickenpox as a child. Your GP may have noted that you had chickenpox in your medical records. If there is nothing in your notes, your GP can carry out a blood test to see if you have immunity to chickenpox. If people in ''at-risk'' groups cannot have the vaccine, what treatments are available if they are exposed to chickenpox? People with weakened immune systems and pregnant women without immunity who are exposed to chickenpox can be given a medication called varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG). VZIG contains chickenpox virus-fighting antibodies, and can reduce chickenpox symptoms and lower the risk of complications for those exposed to the infection. I recently had the chickenpox vaccine and have just found out I''m pregnant. What should I do? If you find out you are pregnant within a month of having the chickenpox vaccine, it''s best to contact your GP for advice. Don''t worry. A study in the US of nearly 700 women who had received the chickenpox vaccine while pregnant found no cases of babies affected by the vaccine.

What to do when you first become a carer Media last reviewed: 30/09/2015 Next review due: 30/09/2017 Knowing what benefits you and the person you care for are entitled to can make a real difference. For example, you might be able to get a break from caring, or get help with pay for certain costs, or make a difference to your pension entitlements in the future. There are three main types of benefits: benefits if you''re not in paid employment – "earnings replacement benefits" benefits that help pay for extra costs, such as those relating to disability or having a child benefits and tax credits that top up low income if you''re in work – "means-tested benefits" Carer''s Allowance, an earnings replacement benefit, is the main benefit for carers. You may be eligible if you are looking after someone for 35 hours a week or more. Your step-by-step guide to carers'' benefits You may be entitled to only one benefit or a combination of all three types. To work out which benefits you''re entitled to, follow the steps below: Step 1 – check earnings replacement benefits Carer''s Allowance is one of the earnings replacement benefits. Check if you''re entitled to Carer''s Allowance or another earnings replacement benefit – you could use the online benefits adviser. If you''re entitled to more than one of these benefits, the one that offers the highest amount of money will be paid. If you are over pension age and retired, you will be eligible for the State Pension. Between 2010 and 2020, the State Pension age for women will move gradually from 60 to 65. You can check your retirement age on GOV.UK. Most people who receive the State Pension automatically qualify for the Winter Fuel Payment as well. Usually, you will not be able to receive Carer''s Allowance once you receive your State Pension. However, you will still have an "underlying entitlement" to it, and this can help you qualify for other means-tested benefits and related payments such as the carer premium. Carer premium The carer premium is a payment included in the calculation of any means-tested benefits you get if you''re also paid Carer''s Allowance or have an underlying entitlement to it. The exact amount you receive depends on your financial situation. Not everyone will receive the full amount. Find out what the other earnings replacement benefits are. Step 2 – check for benefits that can help with extra costs Many carers not only look after someone, but are ill themselves. If you''re aged 16 to 64 and have a long-term illness or disability, you could be entitled to Personal Independence Payment (PIP), or Attendance Allowance (AA) if you''re 65 or over. PIP helps with some of the extra costs caused by long-term ill health or a disability. AA is paid if you''re severely disabled and need help with personal care. If you have children, Child Benefit should also be paid, and if your child is disabled, you can claim Disability Living Allowance on their behalf until they turn 16. These benefits can be paid in addition to any earnings replacement benefit. Step 3 – check for means-tested benefits Check if you''re entitled to any means-tested benefits or tax credits using the online benefits adviser. Means-tested benefits – sometimes called top-up benefits because they "top up" your income – can be paid in addition to other benefits you might also be getting. The main means-tested benefits you may be eligible for are: Income Support – this is paid to some people who are below the qualifying age for the Guarantee Credit part of Pension Credit, who are on a low income, and don''t have to sign on as being unemployed, such as carers or single parents. Income-related Employment and Support Allowance – this is a new benefit paid to people under 65 who have a limited capacity for work because of ill health or a disability. It can also help with the interest-only part of your mortgage payments. Income-based Jobseeker''s Allowance – this is paid to people who are actively seeking work. It can also help with some mortgage payments. Pension Credit – this has two parts: the Guarantee Credit, which is paid to people who have reached the qualifying age to top up their income, and the Savings Credit, which is paid to people aged 65 and over and rewards them for having some savings. Pension Credit can also help with some mortgage payments. Universal Credit If you''re entitled to more than one, call Carers Direct on 0300 123 1053, or contact the Citizens Advice Bureau to get advice on which will pay you the most. Universal Credit Universal Credit is a new benefit designed to give financial assistance to people who want to work. It provides support for housing costs, children, childcare costs, disabled people and carers. It is gradually replacing: income-based Jobseeker''s Allowance income-related Employment Support Allowance  Income Support  Child Tax Credit  Working Tax Credit  Housing Benefit Universal Credit will be available for claimants who are in work and on low incomes, as well as for those who are out of work. This means there is ongoing support if you''re moving in and out of work – Universal Credit support doesn''t suddenly stop during the critical period when you start a new job or increase your part-time hours. Additional means-tested benefits In addition to one of the means-tested benefits, you may also be eligible for: Housing Benefit, which is paid to people who pay rent and have a low income a Cold Weather payment between the months of November and February disability premiums if you are ill or disabled Disability premium is an extra amount automatically added to your Income Support if you qualify for it. The person you care for might get more if they qualify for the extra parts of the disability premium, such as severe disability premium. However, if you are paid Carer''s Allowance, the person you look after will lose their eligibility for the severe disability premium. Find out more on GOV.UK: eligibility for disability premium. Learn more about claiming income-related benefits. Other earnings replacement benefits Bereavement benefits You can claim certain benefits if you were looking after someone who has died. Bereavement benefits are not means-tested, but they will be taken into account as income if you claim any means-tested benefits. Bereavement Payment Bereavement Payment is a one-off, tax-free lump sum payment of £2,000 paid in some circumstances on the death of your spouse or civil partner. Find out more on GOV.UK: Bereavement Payment. Bereavement Allowance Bereavement Allowance is a regular taxable payment made if you were aged 45 or over when your spouse or civil partner died. It is payable for 52 weeks. The amount you''re paid relates to your age when your spouse or civil partner died. It is only payable up to State Pension age and will be reduced if your spouse or civil partner''s National Insurance contribution record was incomplete. Read more on GOV.UK: Bereavement Allowance. Widowed Parent''s Allowance Widowed Parent''s Allowance is a regular taxable payment for men or women under pension age who have been bereaved and have dependent children (or, in the case of women, if they''re pregnant). If your spouse or civil partner met the National Insurance contributions conditions, the full rate is payable. If not, you receive a proportion of the allowance, unless they died of an industrial injury or disease. You cannot be paid Widowed Parent''s Allowance and Bereavement Allowance at the same time. A Bereavement Payment can be paid in addition to Widowed Parent''s Allowance or Bereavement Allowance. To claim a bereavement benefit, ask for the appropriate claim form from any Department for Work and Pensions or Jobcentre Plus office. Find out more on GOV.UK: Widowed Parent''s Allowance. Bereavement and benefits after pension age Widowed Parent''s Allowance and Bereavement Allowance cannot be paid after State Pension age. When you reach State Pension age, if you haven''t remarried or formed a civil partnership, you''ll be entitled to a pension as long as your late spouse or civil partner satisfied the National Insurance contributions, or died as a result of an industrial injury or disease. You could qualify for a pension based on both your own National Insurance contributions record and your spouse or civil partner''s record, if that would give you a higher State Pension. For further details, contact the Pension Service on 0800 731 7898. The official online source of government information on benefits is GOV.UK. Contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance and Jobseeker''s Allowance Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) is a benefit for people whose ability to work is limited by the effects of ill health or disability. Contributory ESA is payable if you''ve paid enough National Insurance (NI) contributions in a set period. You will only receive ESA if you are deemed to have limited capability for work. During the first 13 weeks of your claim, you''ll have a Work Capability Assessment. This assessment decides if you have limited capability for work and can qualify for ESA, or if you should claim Jobseeker''s Allowance or another appropriate benefit.

(166, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/whooping-cough-vaccination-pregnant.aspx', 'Whooping cough vaccine for pregnant women', 'Whooping cough vaccination in pregnancy - NHS Choices', '', 'There''s a lot of whooping cough (pertussis) around at the moment and babies who are too young to start their vaccinations are at greatest risk. Young babies with whooping cough are often very unwell and most will be admitted to hospital because of their illness. When whooping cough is particularly severe, they can die. Pregnant women can help protect their babies by getting vaccinated – ideally from 20 weeks, after the foetal scan, up to 32 weeks pregnant. If for any reason you miss having the vaccine, you can still have it up until you go into labour. Why are pregnant women advised to have the whooping cough vaccine?  When should I have the vaccine? Is the whooping cough vaccine safe in pregnancy? Is whooping cough vaccination in pregnancy working? Which whooping cough vaccine will I be given? The manufacturer''s leaflet says there''s no information on the use of Boostrix IPV in pregnancy. Should it be used in pregnancy? What are the side effects of the whooping cough vaccine?  What is whooping cough? Should I be concerned about whooping cough?  But aren''t babies vaccinated against whooping cough to protect them?  How can I protect my baby?   Will the whooping cough vaccine in pregnancy give me whooping cough? Will my baby still need to be vaccinated against whooping cough at two months old? Can I have the whooping cough vaccine at the same time as the flu jab? How can I get the whooping cough vaccination? I was vaccinated against whooping cough as a child, do I have to be vaccinated again?  I was vaccinated against whooping cough in a previous pregnancy, do I need to be vaccinated again? How do I spot whooping cough in my baby? Why are pregnant women advised to have the whooping cough vaccine? Getting vaccinated while you''re pregnant is highly effective in protecting your baby from developing whooping cough in the first few weeks of their life. The immunity you get from the vaccine will pass to your baby through the placenta and provide passive protection for them until they are old enough to be routinely vaccinated against whooping cough at two months old. When should I have the whooping cough vaccine? The best time to get vaccinated to protect your baby is from 20 weeks, after you''ve had your scan, up to 32 weeks of pregnancy. This maximises the chance that your baby will be protected from birth, through the transfer of your antibodies before he or she is born. If for any reason you miss having the vaccine, you can still have it up until you go into labour. However, this is not ideal, as your baby is less likely to get protection from you. At this stage of pregnancy, having the vaccination may not directly protect your baby, but would help protect you from whooping cough and from passing it on to your baby.  Is the whooping cough vaccine safe in pregnancy? It''s understandable that you might have concerns about the safety of having a vaccine during pregnancy, but there''s no evidence to suggest that the whooping cough vaccine is unsafe for you or your unborn baby. Pertussis-containing vaccine (whooping cough vaccine) has been used routinely in pregnant women in the UK since October 2012, and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is carefully monitoring its safety. The MHRA''s study of around 20,000 vaccinated women has found no evidence of risks to pregnancy or babies. To date, around 60% of eligible pregnant women have received the whooping cough vaccine with no safety concerns being identified in the baby or mother. A number of other countries, including the US, Argentina, Belgium, Spain, Australia and New Zealand, currently recommend vaccination against whooping cough in pregnancy.  Is whooping cough vaccination in pregnancy working? Yes, it is. Published research from the UK vaccination programme shows that vaccinating pregnant women against whooping cough has been highly effective in protecting young babies until they can have their first vaccination when they are two months old. Babies born to women vaccinated at least a week before birth had a 91% reduced risk of becoming ill with whooping cough in their first weeks of life, compared to babies whose mothers had not been vaccinated. An additional benefit is that the protection the mother receives from the vaccination will lower her own risk of infection and of passing whooping cough on to her baby. Which whooping cough vaccine will I be given? As there is no whooping cough-only vaccine, the vaccine you''ll be given also protects against polio, diphtheria and tetanus. The vaccine is called Boostrix IPV. Boostrix IPV is similar to the 4-in-1 vaccine – the pre-school booster that''s routinely given to children before they start school.  You can read the manufacturer''s patient information leaflet for Boostrix IPV (PDF, 91kb).   The manufacturer''s leaflet says there''s no information on the use of Boostrix IPV in pregnancy. Should it be used in pregnancy?  The licence for Boostrix IPV allows for its use in pregnancy when clearly needed, and when the possible benefits outweigh the possible risks. It is standard practice with most medicines not to test them on pregnant women. This is why the manufacturer''s information leaflet includes this statement, and not because of any specific safety concerns or evidence of harm in pregnancy. Whooping cough-containing vaccine has been used routinely in pregnant women in the UK since October 2012, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is carefully monitoring its safety. The MHRA''s study of around 20,000 women vaccinated with Repevax, the whooping cough vaccine previously offered to pregnant women, found no evidence of risks to pregnancy or pregnancy outcome. Boostrix (similar to Boostrix IPV, but without the polio component) is one of the vaccines routinely recommended in the US for immunisation of pregnant women. Experience in the US has identified no safety concerns with the use of the vaccine in pregnancy. There is no evidence of risk to the pregnant woman or unborn child with inactivated vaccines like Boostrix IPV. An inactivated vaccine is one that does not contain "live" vaccine. Read more about inactivated and "live" vaccines. What are the side effects of the whooping cough vaccine? You may have some mild side effects such as swelling, redness or tenderness where the vaccine is injected in your upper arm, just as you would with any vaccine. These only last a few days. Other side effects can include fever, irritation at the injection site, swelling of the vaccinated arm, loss of appetite, irritability and headache. Serious side effects are extremely rare. What is whooping cough? Whooping cough (medically known as pertussis) is a serious infection that causes long bouts of coughing and choking, making it hard to breathe. The "whoop" is caused by gasping for breath after each bout of coughing, though babies don''t always make this noise. Read more about whooping cough symptoms. Should I be concerned about whooping cough? Whooping cough is a highly infectious, serious illness that can lead to pneumonia and brain damage, particularly in young babies. Most babies with whooping cough will need hospital treatment, and when whooping cough is very severe they may die. You may have thought that whooping cough had died out, but it increased substantially in 2012, with more than 9,000 cases in England. In babies under three months old, 400 had whooping cough and 14 died.  Research from the vaccination programme in England shows that vaccinating pregnant women against whooping cough has been highly effective in protecting young babies until they can receive their own vaccinations from two months of age. In keeping with usual disease patterns, which see cases increasing every three to four years in England, whooping cough cases have fallen in all age groups since 2012. The greatest fall has been in young babies targeted by the pregnancy vaccination programme. Cases of whooping cough in older age groups are still high compared to pre-2012 levels. The number of cases is particularly high in 2016, in line with the typical three to four-yearly peak in disease rates. Babies can be infected by people with whooping cough in these older age groups, so it is still important for pregnant women to be vaccinated to protect their babies. Watch a video describing how nasty whooping cough can be.  But aren''t babies vaccinated against whooping cough to protect them? Yes, they are, but the babies that have been getting whooping cough are generally too young to have started their normal vaccinations, so they are not protected against the disease. So, how can I protect my baby? The only way you can help protect your baby from getting whooping cough in their first few weeks after birth is by having the whooping cough vaccination yourself while you are pregnant. After vaccination, your body produces antibodies to protect against whooping cough. You will then pass some immunity to your unborn baby. Will the whooping cough vaccine in pregnancy give me whooping cough? No. The whooping cough vaccine is not a "live" vaccine. This means it doesn''t contain whooping cough (or polio, diphtheria or tetanus), and can''t cause whooping cough in you, or in your baby. Will my baby still need to be vaccinated against whooping cough at two months if I''ve had the vaccine while pregnant? Yes. Whenever you have the whooping cough vaccine, your baby will still need to be vaccinated according to the normal NHS vaccination schedule when they reach two months old. Babies are protected against whooping cough by the 5-in-1 vaccine. Can I have the whooping cough vaccine at the same time as the flu jab? Yes, you can have the whooping cough vaccine when you get the flu vaccine, but do not delay your flu jab so that you can have both at the same time. How can I get the whooping cough vaccination? The vaccine is available from your GP, though some antenatal clinics also offer it. You may be offered the vaccination at a routine antenatal appointment from around 20 weeks of your pregnancy.  If you are more than 20 weeks pregnant and have not been offered the vaccine, talk to your midwife or GP and make an appointment to get vaccinated. I was vaccinated against whooping cough as a child, do I need to get vaccinated again? Yes, because any protection you may have had through either having whooping cough or being vaccinated when you were young is likely to have worn off and will not provide sufficient protection for your baby. I was vaccinated against whooping cough in a previous pregnancy, do I need to be vaccinated in my current pregnancy? Yes, you should get re-vaccinated from 20 weeks in each pregnancy to maximise protection for your baby. How do I spot whooping cough in my baby? Be alert to the signs and symptoms of whooping cough, which include severe coughing fits that may be accompanied by difficulty breathing (or pauses in breathing in young infants) or vomiting after coughing, and the characteristic "whoop" sound. If you are worried your baby may have whooping cough, contact your doctor immediately.

(168, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/croup/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Croup', 'Croup - NHS Choices', 'Croup  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Croup is a childhood condition that affects the windpipe (trachea), the airways to the lungs (the bronchi) and the voice box (larynx). Children with croup have a distinctive barking cough and will make a harsh sound, known as stridor, when they breathe in. They may also have a hoarse voice and find it difficult to breathe because their airway is blocked. Croup can usually be diagnosed by a GP and treated at home. However, if your child’s symptoms are severe and they are finding it difficult to breathe, take them to the nearest hospital’s accident and emergency (A&E) department. Read more about the symptoms of croup and diagnosing croup. Why does croup happen? Commonly, croup is caused by a virus. Several viruses can cause croup but in most cases it is the parainfluenza virus. Read more about the causes of croup. Who is affected by croup? Croup usually affects young children aged between six months and three years, with most cases occurring in one-year-olds.  However, croup can sometimes develop in babies as young as three months, and older children up to 15 years of age. Adults can also get croup but this is rare. The condition is more common during the late autumn and early winter months.  It tends to affect more boys than girls. A child may experience croup more than once during childhood. Treating croup Most cases of croup are mild and can be treated at home. Sitting your child upright and comforting them if they are distressed is important, because crying may make symptoms worse. Your child should also drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. A single dose of an oral corticosteroid medication called dexamethasone or prednisolone will usually also be prescribed to help reduce the swelling in the throat. If your child has breathing problems they may need hospital treatment, such as adrenaline and oxygen through a mask. Read more about treating croup. Complications Most cases of croup clear up within 48 hours. However, in some cases symptoms can last for up to two weeks. It is extremely rare for a child to die from croup. There are a number of conditions that can follow croup, such as pneumonia and middle ear infection. Read more about the complications of croup. Preventing croup Croup is spread in a similar way to the common cold, so it is difficult to prevent. Good hygiene is the main defence against croup, such as regularly washing hands and cleaning surfaces. A number of your child''s routine vaccinations also protect against some of the infections that can cause croup. These include: MMR – protection from measles, mumps and rubella DTaP/IPV/Hib – protection from diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b Croup is a distinctive bark-like cough with a harsh sound known as stridor when breathing in   Community content from HealthUnlocked Pregnancy and baby All you need to know about pregnancy, birth and looking after a baby, including feeding and trying to get pregnant Page last reviewed: 28/08/2014 Next review due: 28/08/2017', 428014547),
(169, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/digeorge-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx', '22q11 deletion (DiGeorge syndrome)', 'DiGeorge syndrome (22q11 deletion) - NHS Choices', 'DiGeorge syndrome (22q11 deletion)  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  DiGeorge syndrome is a genetic disorder that''s usually noticeable at birth. Children with the condition can have heart defects, learning difficulties, a cleft palate and potentially many other problems. In almost all cases, these symptoms and features result from a missing piece of chromosome – a genetic fault, or mutation, called 22q11 deletion. This genetic fault can potentially cause many different combinations of symptoms (syndromes), of which DiGeorge syndrome is just one. The 22q11 deletion is estimated to affect at least one in every 4,000 births. DiGeorge syndrome is generally considered one of the most serious types of 22q11 deletion, but each child with it is affected differently and the symptoms can vary widely. Not every child is severely affected and many will grow up to have a normal life expectancy. This page covers: What are the main features of DiGeorge syndrome?  What is 22q11 deletion? How does the mutation happen?  How is DiGeorge syndrome diagnosed?  What are the chances of my next child having it?  What help and support is available?  What is the outlook? Information about you What are the main features of DiGeorge syndrome?  DiGeorge syndrome can potentially cause many different problems affecting various areas of the body. The main features are described below, but bear in mind that the severity of these problems varies from child to child and some children with the syndrome will only experience a few of them.  Heart problems Most children with DiGeorge syndrome have heart abnormalities from birth, such as a hole in the heart or a problem with the main artery leaving the heart (the aorta). Many children will have four specific structural abnormalities of the heart, collectively known as ''tetralogy of Fallot''. These are: pulmonary stenosis – narrowing between the right heart chamber and the main blood vessel (pulmonary artery) that carries blood from the heart to the lungs  ventricular septal defect – a hole between the right and left pumping chambers (ventricles) of the heart  over-riding aorta – the entrance to the aorta is next to the ventricular septal defect, allowing low-oxygen blood to flow through it thick right ventricle – the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the narrowed pulmonary artery, causing the muscle to thicken A doctor will carry out an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to check if your child has these heart problems. Surgery may be needed to correct some of them. Read more about congenital heart disease. Learning difficulties Commonly, children with DiGeorge syndrome will have slow development of speech and poor concentration, and may struggle with maths and problem solving as they grow up. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder are fairly common, which can make learning even more difficult. The earlier any learning difficulties are noticed the better, as prompt treatment can reduce their impact and allow parents and teachers to organise any special help needed at nursery or school. Problems with the mouth, feeding and hearing Some children with DiGeorge syndrome have a cleft palate (hole in the roof of their mouth) and many more will have a problem with the surrounding mouth muscles. A few will also have a cleft lip (split in the upper lip). Read more about cleft lips and palates. These problems can result in: difficulty with speech and language and a "nasal" voice feeding problems – they may find it hard to chew and swallow solids (dysphagia), may occasionally regurgitate food through their nose when swallowing, and typically do not put on much weight ear infections such as glue ear, which may lead to temporary hearing loss Appearance Children with DiGeorge syndrome tend to have the following features: a long, narrow face wide-set, almond-shaped eyes  a broad nasal bridge and bulbous nose tip a small mouth small, low-set ears that are folded over at the top a cleft lip a cleft palate an irregular skull shape (craniosynostosis) Many of these features will become easier to spot as the child gets older. Infections Children with DiGeorge syndrome generally have weak immune systems because of a problem with the thymus gland – a gland in the chest that produces cells needed to fight invading germs. It means they may be susceptible to recurrent infections such as oral thrush and pneumonia. However, immune system problems often improve with age and routine childhood vaccinations should normally be given to prevent several serious infections. Hormone and growth problems Many children with DiGeorge syndrome also have an underactive parathyroid gland, known as hypoparathyroidism. There are four tiny parathyroid glands, each the size of a grain of rice, in the neck behind the thyroid gland. They produce parathyroid hormone to help control the levels of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D in the bones and blood. An underactive gland causes low levels of calcium in the blood, which can cause problems such as tremors and seizures (fits), although these are unusual after infancy. Calcium supplements may be given to treat this. Some children may also be short for their age because of a growth hormone deficiency, and they may have an underactive thyroid gland. Emotional and mental health problems Children with DiGeorge syndrome may find it difficult to make friends with children their own age and may avoid making eye contact. They may have rapid mood swings, swinging from quietness to hyperactivity, and have unexpected temper tantrums. Teenagers and adults with DiGeorge syndrome are more likely to develop depression and other psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia. Bone and muscle problems Bone and muscle problems are fairly common in people with DiGeorge syndrome. Problems that can occur include: reduced muscle tone or "floppiness" (hypotonia) abnormalities of the spine, such as a curved spine (scoliosis) clumsy walking or hand movements recurrent leg pains rheumatoid arthritis weak muscles, resulting in hernias and constipation (as the gut muscles don''t work very well) a high shoulder blade club foot over-flexible joints (joint hypermobility) undescended testicles  Eye problems Possible eye problems include a squint (where the eyes point in different directions), a hole in the iris of the eye known as coloboma, and childhood cataracts – although these won''t always need treating. Kidney problems It''s quite common for a child with DiGeorge syndrome to have a missing kidney, or for one kidney to be smaller than the other. An ultrasound scan will pick this up. This shouldn''t cause any problems and no treatment is necessary. What is 22q11 deletion? Chromosomes are X-shaped strands of genes, which provide instructions for a person''s characteristics. Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes – one of each pair from their mother, and the other from their father. Each chromosome has a long arm (referred to as ''q'') and a short arm (''p''). In 22q11 deletion, a tiny part of the long arm of chromosome 22 is missing (at position 11). 22q11 is responsible for a wide range of syndromes and conditions, ranging from mild to severe. DiGeorge syndrome is at the more severe end of the range. Scientists are not sure why the same missing piece of chromosome can result in different genetic syndromes. How does the mutation happen?  In most cases of DiGeorge syndrome, the missing piece of chromosome would already have been missing from the egg or sperm from which the baby was conceived. This can happen by chance when DNA is copied to make sperm and eggs and it can''t be predicted or prevented. In these cases, there is usually no family history of the condition.  In around 10% of cases, the 22q11 deletion will have been passed on to the child by one of the parents who has the mutation themselves.   How is DiGeorge syndrome diagnosed?  The piece of missing chromosome that causes DiGeorge syndrome is so small that it cannot be seen under a microscope. Instead, a special test called the FISH test (fluorescence in situ hybridisation) will be needed to diagnose the condition. This test shows whether the region of chromosome 22 is present. If only one copy of chromosome 22 ''lights up'' with fluorescent DNA dye, rather than both copies, the test is positive for 22q11 deletion. The FISH test can be carried out to diagnose an unborn baby using a sample of cells from the placenta (chorionic villus sampling) or a sample of fluid surrounding the baby (amniocentesis). It can be carried out using a blood sample in children and adults. However, this test doesn''t pick up every case of DiGeorge syndrome. Some people will need to have more advanced DNA tests and occasionally the diagnosis may be solely made on the characteristic features and symptoms. What are the chances of my next child having it?  A parent with DiGeorge syndrome has a 50% chance of passing on the condition to their child. This applies in each pregnancy. If neither parent has the condition, the risk of having another child with it is around 1%. If you''re at risk of having a baby with DiGeorge syndrome, you should be referred for genetic counselling to discuss the level of risk and what your options are. The earliest an unborn baby can be tested in pregnancy is at 10-12 weeks, by chorionic villus sampling. Testing is also available by amniocentesis from 15-16 weeks onwards. It''s important to be aware, however, that these tests cannot predict how severely a child with 22q11 deletion will be affected. Find out more about genetic testing and counselling. What help and support is available?  There''s no cure for DiGeorge syndrome, but many of the problems experienced by people with the condition can be monitored and treated if necessary. Your child will have regular tests from infancy onwards, including: hearing tests and eye examinations blood tests to check hormone and calcium levels medical tests of their immune system kidney and heart scans and tests Before they start school, your child''s developmental progress and speech and language development should be carefully assessed. If your child has a learning disability, their educational needs can be met either in a mainstream school with extra support, or in a special school. Read more about education for children with learning disabilities. A physiotherapist can help with any physical problems – for example, shoe inserts (orthoses) may help your child''s leg pains. Read more about physiotherapy. Speech therapy can help with speech problems, and dietary changes or tube feeding may be needed temporarily to help with swallowing or feeding difficulties. Surgery may be needed to correct any severe problems, such as heart surgery or an operation to reduce the amount of air escaping through their nose (if your child''s speech is very nasal). You may find it useful to discuss your concerns with a social worker, psychologist or counsellor, who you can contact directly or via your doctor. Read more about caring for a disabled child and childcare options for disabled children.  Self-help groups such as the Max Appeal may also be a good source of information and support. What is the outlook? Nowadays, most children with DiGeorge syndrome will survive into adulthood – particularly if heart problems are detected and treated early on. Less than 5% of babies die before their first birthday. As a child with DiGeorge syndrome gets older, physical features such as heart and speech problems tend to become less of an issue, but behavioural, learning and mental health problems may affect daily life. Many of those who reach adulthood will have a relatively normal life span, although for some people, ongoing health problems mean their life expectancy is lower than the average. Regular check-ups are necessary to monitor the condition. Adults with DiGeorge syndrome are often able to live independently and have jobs, although some people experience social isolation and employment problems as a result of their condition. Information about your child If your child has DiGeorge syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Related conditions As well as DiGeorge syndrome, several other conditions can be caused by 22q11 deletion. One of the main other types of 22q11 deletion is velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS). VCFS generally has many similar symptoms to DiGeorge syndrome, including problems with the structure and function of the palate ("velo" refers to the roof of the mouth) and heart problems from birth, but these tend to be less severe.

There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes – where the body''s immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin type 2 diabetes – where the body doesn''t produce enough insulin, or the body''s cells don''t react to insulin Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. In the UK, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2. During pregnancy, some women have such high levels of blood glucose that their body is unable to produce enough insulin to absorb it all. This is known as gestational diabetes. Pre-diabetes Many more people have blood sugar levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes. This is sometimes known as pre-diabetes. If your blood sugar level is above the normal range, your risk of developing full-blown diabetes is increased. It''s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it will get progressively worse if left untreated. When to see a doctor Visit your GP as soon as possible if you experience the main symptoms of diabetes, which include: feeling very thirsty urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired weight loss and loss of muscle bulk itching around the penis or vagina, or frequent episodes of thrush cuts or wounds that heal slowly blurred vision Type 1 diabetes can develop quickly over weeks or even days. Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because the early symptoms tend to be general.

Causes of diabetes The amount of sugar in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach). When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it''s broken down to produce energy. However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there''s either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced doesn''t work properly. Although there are no lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes is often linked to being overweight. Read about how to reduce your diabetes risk. Living with diabetes If you''re diagnosed with diabetes, you''ll need to eat healthily, take regular exercise and carry out regular blood tests to ensure your blood glucose levels stay balanced. You can use the BMI healthy weight calculator to check whether you''re a healthy weight. People diagnosed with type 1 diabetes also require regular insulin injections for the rest of their life. As type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, medication may eventually be required, usually in the form of tablets. Read about:  Treating type 1 diabetes Treating type 2 diabetes Living with diabetes Diabetic eye screening Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year. If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it''s not treated. Screening, which involves a half-hour check to examine the back of the eyes, is a way of detecting the condition early so it can be treated more effectively. Read more about diabetic eye screening.

The vaccine also has few side effects. The brand name of the Hib/Men C vaccine given in the UK is Menitorix. Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for Menitorix (PDF, 104kb). Read more about the Hib/Men C vaccine side effects. How effective is the Hib/Men C vaccine? The Hib/Men C booster is highly effective and protects children when they are most vulnerable to these diseases. Rates of Hib and Men C disease in the UK are now at their lowest-ever levels as a result of vaccination. How does the Hib/Men C vaccine work? The Hib/Men C vaccine contains bits of the bacteria that cause the diseases it protects against. If your child comes into contact with these germs, the antibodies their body produces after vaccination will fight the infection to stop the disease taking hold.

Read more about travel vaccinations. Find out which countries have a high rate of TB. Individual requests for BCG vaccination If you want BCG vaccination for yourself or your child, you will be assessed to see if you are at high risk of catching TB. If you aren''t at risk, you won''t be eligible for BCG vaccination. If you are at risk, you will be tuberculin tested and offered BCG vaccination according to local arrangements. The tuberculin skin test/Mantoux test Before you have the BCG vaccination, you should be tested to see if you are already infected with or have active TB disease.  The test, called the tuberculin skin test, or Mantoux test, will be carried out before BCG vaccination if someone: is six years or over is a baby or child under six with a history of residence or a prolonged stay (more than three months) in a country with a high rate of TB  has had close contact with a person with TB has a family history of TB within the last five years The Mantoux test assesses your sensitivity to a substance called a tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) when it''s injected into your skin.   The greater the reaction, the more likely it is that an individual is infected with or has active TB. In this case, the individual should not have the BCG vaccine, as it would have no clinical benefit and may cause unpleasant side effects.  If you have a strongly positive Mantoux result, you should be referred to a TB specialist team for further assessment. If the Mantoux test is negative, you can go ahead and have the BCG vaccine. Who should not have the BCG vaccination? The BCG vaccine is not recommended for: people who have already had a BCG vaccination people with a past history of TB people with a positive tuberculin skin test (Mantoux) people who have had a previous anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) to any of the substances used in the vaccine newborn babies in a household where a case of TB is suspected or confirmed people who have a septic skin condition at the site where the injection will be given  people who have received another live vaccine less than three weeks earlier people with a weakened immune system, either as a result of a health condition such as HIV, treatments such as chemotherapy, or medicines that suppress the immune system, such as steroid tablets people who have cancer of the white blood cells, bone marrow or lymph nodes, such as leukaemia or lymphoma people who are seriously unwell (vaccination should be delayed until they recover) pregnant women BCG vaccinations are not usually offered to people over the age of 16 and never over the age of 35, because the vaccine doesn''t work well in adults.

The 4-in-1 pre-school booster vaccine increases their immunity even further. When should children have the 4-in-1 booster vaccine? The 4-in-1 booster vaccine is routinely offered to children at the age of three years and four months old.   How is the 4-in-1 vaccine given? It''s injected into the child''s upper arm. Can the 4-in-1 pre-school booster vaccine be given with other vaccines? The pre-school booster can be given at the same time as other vaccines. It''s usually given at the same time as the second dose of the MMR vaccine. This NHS leaflet tells you more about pre-school immunisations (PDF, 835kb). How well does the 4-in-1 pre-school booster work? Studies have shown that the pre-school booster is very effective. In clinical tests, more than 99% of children who had been given the 4-in-1 pre-school booster were protected against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and polio. The vaccine protects children from these infections until they receive their teenage 3-in-1 booster at the age of 14.  The 4-in-1 vaccine not only protects your child against these infections, but also stops them passing the germs on to babies who are too young to have had all of their vaccinations. How safe is the 4-in-1 booster vaccine? Before anyone can be given a vaccine, it has to go through many tests to check that it is safe and that it works. However, the 4-in-1 pre-school booster, like other vaccines, can have side effects in some children. Side effects of the 4-in-1 vaccine are usually mild. Your child may get a little redness, swelling or tenderness where the injection was given that will disappear on its own. This NHS leaflet tells you about common vaccination reactions in young children up to five years of age (PDF, 118kb). There are two different 4-in-1 vaccines that are used in the UK – Infanrix IPV and REPEVAX. Both vaccines provide good booster responses, so it doesn''t matter which one your child is given as their pre-school booster.  Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for Infanrix IPV (PDF, 68kb). Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for REPEVAX (PDF, 30kb). Read more about the 4-in-1 pre-school booster side effects. Which children can''t have the 4-in-1 booster vaccine? The vast majority of children can have the 4-in-1 booster vaccine, but there are a few children who shouldn''t have it. They include children who: are allergic to the vaccine have a fever at the time of the vaccination appointment The vaccine should not be given to children who have had an anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) to any part of the vaccine before. There is no need to postpone vaccination if your child has a minor illness, such as a cough or a cold with no fever. But if your baby is ill with a fever, it''s best to delay vaccination until they have recovered. Why is inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) used rather than oral polio vaccine (OPV), as in the past? Oral polio vaccine (OPV) was used from the 1960s because the live vaccine provided better community-wide protection against polio. Now that polio has been wiped out from large parts of the world, the risk of polio is so low that it is an appropriate time to switch to inactivated polio vaccine, which is given as an injection and does not carry the risk of paralytic polio. Can you get polio from the polio part of this vaccine? The 4-in-1 pre-school booster uses inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot cause polio.  Page last reviewed: 18/05/2016 Next review due: 18/05/2018 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

If you''re worried about your child, it may help to speak to their teachers before seeing your GP, to find out if they have any concerns about your child''s behaviour. Your GP can''t formally diagnose ADHD, but they can discuss your concerns with you and refer you for a specialist assessment, if necessary. When you see your GP, they may ask you: about your symptoms or those of your child when these symptoms started where the symptoms occur – for example, at home or in school whether the symptoms affect your or your child’s day-to-day life – for example, if they make socialising difficult if there have been any recent significant events in your life or your child''s, such as a death or divorce in the family if there''s a family history of ADHD about any other problems or symptoms of different health conditions you or your child may have Next steps If your GP thinks your child may have ADHD, they may first suggest a period of "watchful waiting" lasting around 10 weeks – to see if your child''s symptoms improve, stay the same or get worse. They may also suggest starting a parent training or education programme to teach you ways of helping your child (see treating ADHD for more information). If your child''s behaviour doesn''t improve, and both you and your GP believe it''s seriously affecting their day-to-day life, your GP should refer you and your child to a specialist for a formal assessment (see below). For adults with possible ADHD, your GP will assess your symptoms and may refer you for an assessment if: you weren''t diagnosed with ADHD as a child, but your symptoms began during childhood and have been ongoing since then your symptoms can''t be explained by a mental health condition your symptoms have a significant impact on your day-to-day life – for example, if you''re underachieving at work or find intimate relationships difficult You may also be referred to a specialist if you had ADHD as a child or young person, and your symptoms are now causing moderate or severe functional impairment. Assessment There are a number of different specialists that you or your child may be referred to for a formal assessment, including: a child or adult psychiatrist a paediatrician (a specialist in children''s health) a learning disability specialist, social worker or occupational therapist with expertise in ADHD Who you''re referred to depends on your age and what''s available in your local area. There''s no simple test to determine whether you or your child have ADHD, but your specialist can make an accurate diagnosis after a detailed assessment that may include: a physical examination, which can help rule out other possible causes for the symptoms a series of interviews with you or your child interviews or reports from other significant people, such as partners, parents and teachers The criteria for making a diagnosis of ADHD in children, teenagers and adults are outlined below. Diagnosis in children and teenagers Diagnosing ADHD in children depends on a set of strict criteria. To be diagnosed with ADHD, your child must have six or more symptoms of inattentiveness, or six or more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Read more about the symptoms of ADHD. To be diagnosed with ADHD, your child must also have: been displaying symptoms continuously for at least six months started to show symptoms before the age of 12 been showing symptoms in at least two different settings – for example, at home and at school, to rule out the possibility that the behaviour is just a reaction to certain teachers or parental control symptoms that make their lives considerably more difficult on a social, academic or occupational level symptoms that aren''t just part of a developmental disorder or difficult phase, and aren''t better accounted for by another condition Diagnosis in adults Diagnosing ADHD in adults is more difficult because there''s some disagreement about whether the list of symptoms used to diagnose children and teenagers also applies to adults. In some cases, an adult may be diagnosed with ADHD if they have five or more symptoms of inattentiveness, or five or more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness, that are listed in diagnostic criteria for children with ADHD. As part of your assessment, the specialist will ask about your present symptoms. However, under current diagnostic guidelines, a diagnosis of ADHD in adults can''t be confirmed unless your symptoms have been present from childhood. If you find it difficult to remember whether you had problems as a child, or you weren''t diagnosed with ADHD when you were younger, your specialist may wish to see your old school records or talk to your parents, teachers or anyone else who knew you well when you were a child. For an adult to be diagnosed with ADHD, their symptoms should also have a moderate impact on different areas of their life, such as: underachieving at work or in education driving dangerously difficultly making or keeping friends difficulty in relationships with partners If your problems are recent and didn''t occur regularly in the past, you''re not considered to have ADHD. This is because it''s currently not thought that ADHD can develop for the first time in adults.

(177, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/young-carers-rights.aspx', 'Young carers', 'Young carers'' rights - Care and support - NHS Choices', '', 'A young carer is someone aged 18 or under who helps look after a relative who has a condition, such as a disability, illness, mental health condition, or a drug or alcohol problem. Most young carers look after one of their parents or care for a brother or sister. They do extra jobs in and around the home, such as cooking, cleaning, or helping someone to get dressed and move around. Some children give a lot of physical help to a brother or sister who is disabled or ill. Along with doing things to help your brother or sister, you may also be giving emotional support to both your sibling and your parents. Your choices about caring Some people start caring at a very young age and don''t really realise they are carers. Other young people become carers overnight. If someone in your family needs to be looked after, you may really want to help them. But young carers shouldn''t do the same things as adult carers, nor should they be spending a lot of their time caring for someone, as this can get in the way of them doing well at school and doing the same kinds of things as other children or young people. It''s important you decide how much and what type of care you''re willing or able to give, or whether you should be a carer at all. You need to decide whether you''re the right person to offer the care that the person you look after needs. All disabled adults are entitled to support from their local authority, depending on their needs, so they should not have to rely on their children to care for them. It''s important for social services to ensure the whole family feels supported and comfortable with your role. Find out more about who can help young carers. Young carers'' rights The law is changing for young carers, and from April 2015 a social worker from your local authority must visit to carry out a “young carers needs assessment” to decide what kind of help you and your family might need if you or your parents request this. If the local authority has already carried out one of these assessments before, they must carry out another one if you or your parents feel that your needs or circumstances have changed. A young carer’s needs assessment must decide whether it is appropriate for you to care for someone else – and this includes taking into account whether you want to be a carer. The local authority must also look at your education, training, leisure opportunities and your views about your future. When assessing a young carer they must always ask about your wishes and involve you, your parents and anyone else you or your parents want to be involved. All these people should receive a written record of the assessment. This should include whether the local authority thinks you need support, whether their services could provide you with that support, and whether they will give you that support. It should also explain what you can do if you or your parents disagree with the assessment. Provided that you both agree, the local authority can assess both your needs as a young carer and the needs of the person you care for, at the same time. If you’re 16 or over, and you’re not in full-time education you may be eligible for help finding work as well as help with your family’s finances, for instance through benefits such as Carer’s Allowance. Your assessment is the best place to find out about what is available in your situation. Find out about having a carer''s assessment.

Common side effects of the shingles vaccine, which occur in at least 1 in 10 people, are: headache redness, pain, swelling, itching, warmth and bruising at the injection site If any side effects carry on for longer than a few days, speak to your GP or practice nurse. Tell your GP if you develop a rash after having the shingles vaccination. Catching chickenpox from the shingles vaccine Very occasionally, a person has developed chickenpox following shingles vaccination (fewer than 1 in 10,000 individuals). Allergic reaction to shingles vaccination There is a very small chance of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to the shingles vaccine, as there is with other vaccines. Anaphylaxis is very serious and potentially life-threatening, but it can be treated. All healthcare staff that deliver vaccinations are trained in this. With prompt treatment, people recover fully from anaphylaxis. The risk of having a severe allergic reaction after vaccination has been estimated at around 1 in 900,000 (a little more than one in a million).

Pension Credit has two parts: the Guarantee Credit and the Savings Credit. You can be paid Guarantee Credit alone or Savings Credit alone, or both if you qualify. They are paid for different reasons. Guarantee Credit You can claim Guarantee Credit if you or your partner have reached the qualifying age. The qualifying age for Guarantee Credit is gradually going up to 65, in line with the increase in women’s State Pension age and any further increase in the State Pension age. You can find out more in the GOV.UK Pension Credit guide. You can check what your qualifying age will be on the GOV.UK: State Pension age calculator. Guarantee Credit is designed to top up your weekly income if it is below a certain amount. The amount paid depends on whether you''re single or you live with a partner. It can be paid at a higher rate if you''re severely disabled, a carer, or both. It can also provide help with certain housing costs if you''re responsible for paying a mortgage or other costs relating to owning your home. Your income and capital (and those of your partner, if you have one) are taken into account when Pension Credit is worked out. If your weekly income is below a certain level, you''ll receive some Guarantee Credit. Even if the amount you receive is quite small, it''s worth claiming because it also entitles you to extra help. Savings Credit You may qualify for Savings Credit if you or your partner are over 65 and if your qualifying income is over a specified amount. It''s an extra amount for those people who have made some provisions for their retirement, such as contributing to a personal pension or building up a modest amount of savings. It can be paid on its own or on top of Guarantee Credit. Even when paid on its own, Savings Credit can lead to a certain amount of extra help. Claiming Pension Credit The easiest way to apply for Pension Credit is by phone on 0800 99 1234 (textphone 0800 169 0133) from Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm. A friend or family member can call for you – although you must be with them when they call. Alternatively, you can ask for a paper application by calling the helpline or by contacting a voluntary organisation (such as Citizens Advice) in your area. Work and Pension Credit It''s possible to work and claim Pension Credit. There''s no limit to the hours you work, but your earnings will affect how much Pension Credit you get. However, for Pension Credit, your earnings will count as income and this will affect the amount you are paid. If your income is too high, you''ll no longer receive Guarantee Credit. You may still be entitled to Savings Credit even if your earnings mean you no longer get Guarantee Credit. If you work more than 16 hours a week, you may be eligible for Working Tax Credit. It''s possible to claim this alongside Pension Credit, but any Working Tax Credit you get will count as income for Pension Credit purposes. For more information, see Claiming income-related benefits.

It usually causes a bright red rash on the cheeks. Although the rash can look alarming, slapped cheek syndrome is normally a mild infection that clears up by itself in one to three weeks. Once you''ve had the infection, you''re usually immune to it for life. However, slapped cheek syndrome can be more serious for some people. If you''re pregnant, have a blood disorder or a weakened immune system and have been exposed to the virus, you should get medical advice. This page covers: Symptoms When to get medical advice What to do if you or your child has it How you get it Prevention Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome usually develop 4-14 days after becoming infected, but sometimes may not appear for up to 21 days. Initial symptoms Some people with slapped cheek syndrome won''t notice any early symptoms, but most people will have the following symptoms for a few days: a slightly high temperature (fever) of around 38C (100.4F) a runny nose  a sore throat a headache an upset stomach feeling generally unwell The infection is most contagious during this initial period. In adults, these symptoms are often accompanied by joint pain and stiffness, which may continue for several weeks or even months after the other symptoms have passed. Slapped cheek rash After a few days, a distinctive bright red rash on both cheeks (the so-called "slapped cheeks") normally appears, although adults may not get this. By the time this rash develops, the condition is no longer contagious. After another few days, a light pink rash may also appear on the chest, stomach, arms and thighs. This often has a raised, lace-like appearance and may be itchy. The rashes will normally fade within a week or two, although occasionally the body rash may come and go for a few weeks after the infection has passed. This can be triggered by exercise, heat, anxiety or stress. When to get medical advice You don''t usually need to see your GP if you think you or your child has slapped cheek syndrome, as the condition normally gets better on its own. However, you should contact your GP, call NHS 111 or contact your local out-of-hours service if you have been exposed to anyone with slapped cheek or you have symptoms of the infection and: you''re pregnant – infection in pregnancy, particularly early pregnancy, carries a risk of causing miscarriage, stillbirth or other complications; however, this risk is small and most pregnant women will already be immune (read more about the risks of slapped cheek syndrome in pregnancy) you have a blood disorder, such as sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia, or a weakened immune system – the infection can cause severe anaemia that may need to be treated in hospital you have symptoms of severe anaemia, such as very pale skin, severe shortness of breath, extreme tiredness or fainting In these cases, a blood test may be carried out to see if you''re immune to the infection. If you''re not immune, you''ll be monitored carefully to check for any problems. If you develop severe anaemia, it''s likely that you''ll need to be admitted to hospital and have a blood transfusion to replace your damaged blood cells. What to do if you or your child has slapped cheek Slapped cheek syndrome is usually mild and should clear up without specific treatment. If you or your child is feeling unwell, you can try the following to ease the symptoms: rest and drink plenty of fluids – babies should continue their normal feeds for a fever, headaches or joint pain, you can take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen – children under 16 shouldn''t take aspirin to reduce itchiness, you can take antihistamines or use an emollient (moisturising lotion) – some antihistamines are not suitable for young children, so check with your pharmacist first Unless you or your child is feeling unwell, there’s no need to stay away from school or work once the rash has developed, as the infection is no longer contagious by this point. It''s a good idea to notify your child''s school about the infection, so children who develop early symptoms can be spotted quickly and vulnerable people can be made aware that they may need to get medical advice. How do you get slapped cheek syndrome? Slapped cheek syndrome is caused by a virus called parvovirus B19. This is found in the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of someone with the infection. The virus is spread in a similar way to colds and flu. You can become infected by:  inhaling droplets that are sneezed or coughed out by someone with the infection touching a contaminated surface or object and then touching your mouth or nose Someone with slapped cheek syndrome is infectious during the period before the rash develops. Once the rash appears, the condition can no longer be passed on. Preventing slapped cheek syndrome It''s very difficult to prevent slapped cheek syndrome, because people who have the infection are most contagious before they develop any obvious symptoms. However, making sure that everyone in your household washes their hands frequently may help stop the infection from spreading. There''s currently no vaccine available to protect you against the condition. Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 13/10/2015 Next review due: 01/10/2018', 423850798),

What''s the best way of dealing with an active child? (9 to 30 months) Media last reviewed: 17/01/2015 Next review due: 17/01/2017 Young children like to be active, and it''s normal for them to have lots of energy. Keeping babies and toddlers active every day is good for their health. Looking after a child who is always on the go can be tiring and stressful, but there are things you can do to make life easier for both of you. Tips for daily life with a very active child keep to a daily routine – routine can help if your child is restless or difficult; it can also help you stay calm and cope with the strain dedicate time to your child – since your child may be demanding your attention for most of the day (and sometimes at night, too) you''ll often have to say no to them; that will be easier to do and easier for your child to accept if there are times each day when you give them all your attention avoid difficult situations – for example, keep shopping trips short try to go out every day – go to a park, playground or other safe, open space where your child can run around and use up energy set small goals – help your child to sit still or be controlled, and encourage them to concentrate for a very short time, then gradually build it up; remember, you can''t transform your child''s behaviour overnight Many children seem overactive, but only about 2% of children in the UK have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is what used to be known as hyperactivity. The challenge for parents and health professionals is to recognise the difference between the normal energy levels of a young child and ADHD symptoms. Identifying ADHD early is important to make sure your child gets the support they need. If you are worried about your child''s behaviour, talk to your health visitor or GP.

High-risk areas Typhoid is found throughout the world, but it''s more likely to occur in areas where there''s poor sanitation and hygiene. High-risk areas include: the Indian subcontinent Africa South and South East Asia South America the Middle East Europe Central America Vaccination is strongly recommended if you''re going to be staying or working with local people, or if you''re going to be staying for prolonged periods in areas where sanitation and food hygiene are likely to be poor. In the UK, most people who get typhoid fever develop it while visiting India, Pakistan or Bangladesh. It''s therefore particularly important that you''re vaccinated if you''re visiting these countries. Vaccination against typhoid fever is usually free on the NHS from GP surgeries. Private travel clinics also offer the vaccine for about £30. Choosing a typhoid vaccine In the UK, the two main vaccines available to prevent typhoid fever are: Vi vaccine – given as a single injection Ty21a vaccine – given as three capsules to take on alternate days Combined typhoid and hepatitis A injections are also available for people aged 15 or older. Protection against hepatitis A lasts one year and protection against typhoid lasts three years. The vaccines work by stimulating your body to create antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) that prevent you getting ill if you become infected with the typhoid bacteria. It''s important to remember that none of the typhoid vaccines are 100% effective, and you should always take precautions when eating food and drinking water abroad (see the advice below about this). The Vi vaccine is generally more effective than the Ty21a vaccine, but some people prefer to have the Ty21a vaccine because it doesn''t require an injection. As the Ty21a vaccine contains a live sample of Salmonella typhi bacteria, it isn''t suitable for people with a weakened immune system, such as people with HIV or those receiving certain types of treatment, such as chemotherapy. It also isn''t usually recommended for children under six, whereas children can have the Vi vaccine from two years of age. The typhoid vaccine should ideally be given at least one month before you travel, although if necessary it can be given closer to your travel date. Booster vaccinations are recommended every three years if you continue to be at risk of infection with typhoid bacteria. Side effects of typhoid fever vaccine After having the typhoid fever vaccine, some people have temporary soreness, redness, swelling or hardness at the injection site. About 1 in every 100 people experience a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above. Less common side effects include: abdominal pain headache feeling sick diarrhoea Severe reactions are rare for both typhoid vaccines. Read more about routine NHS vaccinations. Advice for travellers Whether you''ve been vaccinated against typhoid or not, it''s important to take basic precautions when travelling in countries where typhoid fever is present. For example: only drink bottled water from a bottle that was properly sealed, or water that''s been recently boiled  avoid ice cream and don''t have ice in your drinks avoid uncooked fruits and vegetables, unless you''ve washed them in safe water or peeled them yourself avoid shellfish, seafood or salads Read more about food and water abroad.

Medicines can legally be administered by anyone, as long as it has been prescribed by an appropriate practitioner. Although the person you care for may appreciate your support with their medicines, bear in mind that they have a right to confidentiality. It''s up to them to decide how much of their health and medicines information is available to you as their carer, and how much you should be involved in their care. Taking pills correctly Pills or tablets are the most common form of medicine. If the person you care for has a complicated medication regime with different pills taken at different times of the day, you can ask your pharmacist to provide them in dosette boxes. These are plastic boxes with small compartments that show clearly which pills need to be taken at what time of day. Always read the instructions on the packaging or dosette box before giving medicines to anyone. They should always be given either according to the instructions or as advised by whoever prescribed them. Instructions for when and how to give medication should be clear. If you are experiencing any problems, ask a doctor, nurse or pharmacist to explain. It''s important to give medicines at the recommended time of day. Not doing this can make them less effective. You also need to know whether or not the medicines should be taken with food or in between meals.  Ask for a medicines use review If the person you are caring for is taking more than one medicine and has a long-term condition, such as arthritis or diabetes, they should be able to get a free medicines use review with their pharmacist. This is a chance to talk to the pharmacist in confidence about any problems they are having with their medicines. Attending the medicines use review with the person you look after will help you work together to make sure they take the correct medicines in the appropriate doses and at the right times. Watch a video about medicines use reviews. Keeping medicines organised Make sure medicines are all kept in one place in the home, preferably in a cupboard or drawer that can be locked. This is particularly important if children live in or visit the house. You''ll also need to ensure repeat prescriptions are dispensed in time so the person you''re looking after doesn''t run out of medication. If you find you are spending a lot of time fetching prescriptions from the GP and picking up medicines from the pharmacy, ask the GP surgery if they can send prescriptions directly to the pharmacy. Some pharmacists also offer home delivery services for people who find it difficult to get out of the house. Medicines safety for carers There are a number of things you and the person you''re looking after can do to make taking medicines safer: Be aware over-the-counter medication shouldn''t be taken with prescribed medicines unless a doctor or pharmacist has confirmed it''s safe to do so. Be aware that if a dose of the medicine is missed, it may not be safe to take a larger amount later on. Return any surplus medicines to the pharmacist for safe disposal. If the person you care for forgets to take their medicines It''s important to support the person you care for to be as independent as possible with their medicines. But if they keep forgetting to take them, there are several ways you can help. You could consider telephoning them at the times they need to take their medication. Or, if they have care workers, you can arrange for them to visit at the time of day when medication needs to be taken. Automatic pill dispensers are also available. When the medicine needs to be taken, the dispenser beeps and a small opening allows access to the correct pills at the right time. If the person you look after refuses to take their medicines If the person you care for is unwilling to take their medicines for some reason – for example, because they feel they are not working – have a word with their GP or pharmacist. They may be able to suggest a form of the medicine that is more acceptable. Some painkillers, for example, can be prescribed as a long-acting patch that is stuck on the skin rather than as tablets. Never give medication to someone without their consent or try to force them to take it. People have the right to refuse medication. It''s not safe to crush tablets, or open capsules and mix them with food or drink. Help with swallowing difficulties Some people need help with swallowing pills. If you''re worried the person you care for could choke or they are refusing to take their medication, ask your GP or pharmacist if it can be supplied in a soluble or liquid form. Or they can advise you on how to help the person you care for take their pills. See more about swallowing difficulties (dysphagia). Find out how your pharmacist can help with managing medicines.

Complications can include swelling of the ovaries and testicles, infertility, meningitis and deafness. The best protection against mumps is the MMR vaccine. The mumps vaccine is one of the components of the MMR vaccine, which protects against mumps, measles and rubella. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are offered as part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule. If you haven''t had any or both doses of the MMR vaccine, whatever age you are, make an appointment with your GP surgery to have the vaccine. Who''s at risk of catching mumps? The mumps virus can spread very quickly and anyone who has not had two doses of MMR vaccine is at higher risk of catching mumps. This includes young children, teenagers and some adults as they may have been too old to be routinely vaccinated with the MMR vaccine  when it was first introduced in the UK in 1988, or they may only have received one dose of MMR vaccine instead of the recommended two. Most cases of mumps are in older teenagers and young adults so it''s especially important that people in this age group are fully vaccinated, especially if they are planning to go to college or university. Mumps virus can spread quickly when lots of young people are living in close contact.  Cases of mumps During 2015, there were 713 cases of mumps in England. But in the last decade there have been regular mumps outbreaks. The largest one was in 2005 when there were more than 43,000 cases. Mumps cases may rise again in the next few years if people who aren''t vaccinated, or only partially vaccinated don''t get both doses of MMR vaccine. Who should have the MMR vaccine? Anyone who hasn''t received MMR vaccination as a child, or has only received one dose, should go to their GP or college doctor and get the vaccination straight away.

(187, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/vaccine-ingredients.aspx', NULL, 'Vaccination ingredients - Vaccinations - NHS Choices', '', 'The main ingredient of any vaccine is the disease-causing virus, bacteria or toxin, but a number of other components are needed to make the final vaccine as safe and effective as possible. Vaccines contain "killed" (inactivated) or "live" versions of the disease-causing virus, bacteria or toxin. These are known as the vaccine antigen. Both killed and live vaccines work by stimulating the immune system so it thinks it''s being attacked by the active germ. Your body responds by producing antibodies that stay in your system to protect you in the future. Killed vaccines Killed vaccines – also known as inactivated or dead vaccines – contain viruses that have been destroyed with chemicals or heat.  This process destroys the viruses'' ability to replicate in the body and cause illness, but keeps it intact enough so that, when it''s given in a vaccine, a person''s immune system can still recognise it and make a protective antibody response. Killed vaccines generally produce a weaker immune response, so it often takes several doses or a "booster" to maintain your immunity. Examples of killed vaccines are the flu jab, whooping cough vaccine, and polio vaccine. Live vaccines Live vaccines – also called attenuated vaccines – contain viruses that have been weakened, but not destroyed, in a laboratory. The viruses within live vaccines cannot cause disease in healthy people, but can still replicate to produce a strong immune response. They cannot be given to people who are immunosuppressed, however, as there is a risk their immune system would not be able to make antibodies rapidly enough, and they could develop the disease the vaccine is designed to prevent. Because a live vaccine is the closest thing to a natural infection, it typically produces a strong immune response and often gives lifelong protection. Examples of live vaccines are the BCG vaccine, shingles vaccine, MMR vaccine, and the children''s nasal spray flu vaccine. How to find out what''s in a vaccine A complete list of ingredients for each vaccine is given in the patient information leaflet (PIL). These ingredient lists include any products used in the making of a vaccine, even though most are only needed during the production process and are removed or only found in tiny amounts in the final vaccine. Visit the electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC) to search for the PIL of a vaccine using its brand name. Thiomersal (mercury) in vaccines Thiomersal is a preservative that contains small amounts of mercury. It''s used to prevent the growth of bacteria or fungi in the vaccine. High doses of mercury can be toxic to the brain and other organs. However, no harmful effects have been linked with the level of thiomersal used in the small amounts present in vaccines. Although there have been concerns in the past that vaccines that contain thiomersal can cause autism, there is no scientific evidence that this is the case. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated there is no risk from thiomersal in vaccines – read the WHO statement in full. Thiomersal is no longer used in any of the vaccines routinely given to babies and young children in the NHS childhood immunisation programme. Adjuvants in vaccines Adjuvants work to boost our immune response to a vaccine and make it more effective and long-lasting. Using an adjuvant makes it possible to reduce the amount of antigen used in a vaccine, and sometimes the number of doses that need to be given. The amount of adjuvant used in a vaccine is very small and has been shown to be safe, although they can be associated with minor reactions, such as a small lump or redness at the injection site. Most killed vaccines contain a very small amount of aluminium-based adjuvant. Although aluminium can be toxic in large quantities, no harmful effects are seen with the level of aluminium used in such small amounts in vaccines. Pork gelatin in vaccines Gelatin derived from pigs is used as a stabilising agent in some vaccines. Stabilisers are added to vaccines to help protect them from the effects of heat or freeze-drying, and also help maintain the shelf life of the vaccine. The only vaccines containing gelatin in the UK routine vaccination schedule are the MMR vaccine, the shingles vaccine, and the children''s nasal flu vaccine. There have been a small number of allergic reactions to vaccines containing gelatin, so people with a known allergy to gelatin are advised to consult their doctor before receiving a vaccine that contains it. Religious groups such as Muslims and Jews may be concerned about using vaccines containing gelatin from pigs. However, many faith group leaders have stated the use of gelatin in vaccines is acceptable and doesn''t break any religious rules. Read this NHS leaflet about vaccines and porcine gelatin. Read more about religious opinion on pork gelatin in vaccines. Human serum albumin in vaccines Human serum albumin is a substance from human blood. It''s a protein used to stabilise a vaccine and maintain its quality during storage. The serum used in vaccines comes from screened blood donors, and the manufacturing process ensures that any risk of transmitting disease is eliminated. Human serum albumin is used as a stabiliser in a chickenpox vaccine called Varilix. Vaccines can also be produced with recombinant albumin, which doesn''t contain any human or animal products. The albumin is produced by cells, such as yeast cells, that have had the gene for human albumin inserted into them. The cells are then able to generate large quantities of human serum albumin without any need to extract it from human blood.  Recombinant human serum albumin is used as a stabiliser in an MMR vaccine used in the UK called MMRVaxPro. Eggs in vaccines Two vaccines in the UK routine schedule contain small amounts of egg protein – the MMR vaccine and the flu vaccine. Flu vaccine is grown on hens'' eggs and is capable of triggering an allergic reaction. Children and adults with an egg allergy are therefore advised to have an alternative, such as an egg-free inactivated flu vaccine. MMR vaccine is grown on cells from chick embryos, which isn''t the same as hens'' eggs and therefore doesn''t trigger an allergic reaction. Children and adults with a severe egg allergy can safely receive the MMR vaccine. Formaldehyde in vaccines Formaldehyde, widely known as an embalming fluid, is a chemical also used in the production of killed vaccines. It''s used very early in the manufacturing process to kill or inactivate the bacteria, virus or toxin. Once the antigens are inactivated, the formaldehyde is diluted out, but it''s possible trace amounts may remain in the final vaccine. Formaldehyde can be harmful in high concentrations. However, there are no health concerns about the small amounts found in vaccines. Formaldehyde can be found naturally in our bloodstream. It helps with metabolism, and is present at levels far higher than we would be exposed to in vaccines. Antibiotics in vaccines Antibiotics are added to some vaccines to prevent the growth of bacteria during the production and storage of the vaccine. They can only be found in tiny amounts in the final vaccine. Antibiotics associated with allergic reactions, such as penicillin, generally aren''t used in vaccines. However, the MMR vaccine contains tiny amounts of an antibiotic called neomycin, which is capable of triggering an allergic reaction. Anyone known to be allergic to neomycin should consult their doctor before receiving the MMR vaccine.

(188, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Kidney-infection/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Kidney infection', 'Kidney infection - NHS Choices', 'Kidney infection  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  A kidney infection (pyelonephritis) is a painful and unpleasant illness caused by bacteria travelling from your bladder into one or both of your kidneys. It''s more serious than cystitis, a common infection of the bladder that makes urinating painful. If treated promptly, a kidney infection doesn''t cause serious harm, but will make you feel very unwell. If a kidney infection isn''t treated, it can get worse and cause permanent kidney damage. Symptoms of a kidney infection often come on within a few hours. You can feel feverish, shivery, sick and have a pain in your back or side. Read more about the symptoms of a kidney infection. When to see your GP See your GP if you have a fever and persistent tummy, lower back or genital pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination. Most kidney infections need prompt treatment with antibiotics to stop the infection from damaging the kidneys or spreading to the bloodstream. You may also need painkillers. If you''re especially vulnerable to the effects of an infection – for example, if you have a pre-existing health condition or are pregnant, you may be admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotics through an intravenous drip. After taking antibiotics, you should feel completely better after about two weeks. In rare cases, a kidney infection can cause further problems. These include blood poisoning (sepsis) and a build-up of pus in the kidney called an abscess. Read more about treating a kidney infection and the complications of a kidney infection. What causes a kidney infection? A kidney infection usually happens when bacteria – often a type called E. coli – gets into the urethra (the tube which carries urine out of the body) and travels up through the bladder and into the kidneys. Read more about the causes of a kidney infection. Who''s at risk? Kidney infections are relatively rare. It''s estimated that one in every 830 people develops a kidney infection each year in the UK. They can happen at any age, but are much more common in women. In fact, women are six times more likely to get a kidney infection than men. This is because a woman''s urethra is shorter, making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys. Younger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active, and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection. Younger children are also vulnerable to developing kidney infections because they may be born with an abnormality of the urinary tract or have a condition called vesico-ureteric reflux, where there is a backflow of urine from the bladder up to the kidneys. Can kidney infections be prevented? You can reduce your chances of developing a kidney infection by keeping your bladder and urethra free from bacteria. This can include drinking plenty of fluids, keeping your genitals clean and treating any constipation. Read more about preventing a kidney infection.

These colours include: sunset yellow (E110)  quinoline yellow (E104) carmoisine (E122) allura red (E129) tartrazine (E102) ponceau 4R (E124) These colours are used in a number of foods, including soft drinks, sweets, cakes and ice cream. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has published a list of manufacturers with food ranges free from the six colours. What are E numbers? All food additives, whether natural or artificial, must go through a rigorous safety assessment and approval procedure, and must comply with European Union (EU) legislation. They''re only allowed to be used if experts decide they''re necessary and safe. If a food additive has an E number, this shows it''s passed safety tests and has been approved for use throughout the EU. If colours are used in food they must be declared in the list of ingredients as ''colour'', with either their name or E number. If any of the six colours listed above are in food or drink, the food label must also have a specific warning saying that the colour ''may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children''. You can avoid certain additives by checking the label. If you buy foods without packaging, you''ll need to check with the manufacturer or the person selling the product. The advice about food additives and hyperactivity was issued after being evaluated by the independent Committee on Toxicity and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) following research commissioned by the FSA. The FSA is encouraging manufacturers to work towards finding alternatives to these food colours. Some manufacturers and retailers have already taken action to remove them. The FSA website has more information about where to find products free from the colours associated with hyperactivity. You should also be aware that certain additives, such as sulphites, can cause allergic reactions. Read more about the causes of food allergy. The difference between hyperactivity and ADHD In the context of this advice, hyperactivity is when a child is overactive, can''t concentrate and acts on sudden impulses without thinking about alternatives. Experts think hyperactivity affects 2-5% of children in the UK. There''s no single test for diagnosing it. It''s important to remember that hyperactivity is also associated with factors other than additives, including premature birth, genetics and upbringing. ADHD is more than just hyperactive behaviour. It''s linked to a specific pattern of behaviour, including reduced attention span and difficulty concentrating, to the extent that the child’s ability to learn and function at home and school is affected. Children with ADHD often have learning difficulties and behavioural problems.   Page last reviewed: 18/02/2015 Next review due: 18/02/2017', 310608494),

Vaccinations are available to protect you against infections such as yellow fever, typhoid and hepatitis A. In the UK, the childhood vaccination programme protects you against a number of diseases, but doesn''t cover most of the infectious diseases found overseas. Which jabs do I need? You can find out which vaccinations are necessary or recommended for the areas you''ll be visiting on these two websites: NHS fitfortravel the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) Some countries require you to have an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP) before you enter. For example, Saudi Arabia requires proof of vaccination against certain types of meningitis for visitors arriving for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. Many tropical countries in Africa and South America won''t accept travellers from an area where there''s yellow fever unless they can prove they''ve been vaccinated against it. Read more about the vaccines available for travellers abroad. Where do I get my jabs? You should get advice at least eight weeks before you''re due to travel, as some jabs need to be given well in advance. First, phone or visit your GP or practice nurse to find out whether your existing UK jabs are up-to-date (they can tell from your notes). Your GP or practice nurse may also be able to give you general advice about travel vaccinations and travel health, such as protecting yourself from malaria. Your GP or practice nurse can give you a booster of your UK jabs if you need one. They may be able to give you the travel jabs you need, either free on the NHS or for a charge. Alternatively, you can visit a local private travel vaccination clinic for your UK boosters and other travel jabs. Not all vaccinations are available free on the NHS, even if they''re recommended for travel to a certain area. Free travel vaccinations The following travel vaccinations are usually available free on the NHS: diphtheria, polio and tetanus (combined booster) typhoid hepatitis A – including when combined with typhoid or hepatitis B cholera These vaccines are usually free because they protect against diseases thought to represent the greatest risk to public health if they were brought into the country. Private travel vaccinations You''re likely to have to pay for travel vaccinations against: hepatitis B when not combined with hepatitis A Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis meningitis vaccines  rabies tuberculosis (TB) yellow fever Yellow fever vaccines are only available from designated centres. The NaTHNaC website can help you find a clinic offering yellow fever vaccination. The cost of travel vaccines at private clinics will vary, but could be around £50 for each dose of a vaccine. It''s worth considering this when budgeting for your trip. Things to consider There are several things to consider when planning your travel vaccinations, including: the country or countries you''re visiting – some diseases are more common in certain parts of the world and less common in others  when you''re travelling – some diseases are more common at certain times of the year; for example, during the rainy season where you''re staying – in general, you''ll be more at risk of disease in rural areas than in urban areas, and if you''re backpacking and staying in hostels or camping, you may be more at risk than if you were on a package holiday and staying in a hotel how long you''ll be staying – the longer your stay, the greater your risk of being exposed to diseases your age and health – some people may be more vulnerable to infection than others, while some vaccinations can''t be given to people with certain medical conditions what you''ll be doing during your stay – for example, whether you''ll be spending a lot of time outdoors, such as trekking or working in rural areas if you''re working as an aid worker – you may come into contact with more diseases if you''re working in a refugee camp or helping after a natural disaster if you''re working in a medical setting – for example, a doctor or nurse may require additional vaccinations if you are in contact with animals – in this case, you may be more at risk of getting diseases spread by animals, such as rabies If you''re only travelling to countries in northern and central Europe, North America or Australia, you''re unlikely to need any vaccinations. If possible, see your GP at least eight weeks before you''re due to travel. Some vaccinations need to be given well in advance to allow your body to develop immunity. Some also involve multiple doses spread over several weeks. Pregnancy and breastfeeding Speak to your GP before having any vaccinations if: you''re pregnant you think you might be pregnant you''re breastfeeding In many cases, it''s unlikely a vaccine given while pregnant or breastfeeding will cause problems for the baby. However, your GP will be able to give you further advice about this. People with immune deficiencies For some people travelling overseas, vaccination against certain diseases may not be advised. This may be the case if: you have a condition that affects your body''s immune system, such as HIV or AIDS you''re receiving treatment that affects your immune system, such as chemotherapy you''ve recently had a bone marrow or organ transplant Your GP can give you further advice about this. Non-travel vaccines As well as getting any travel vaccinations you need, it''s also a good opportunity to make sure your other vaccinations are up-to-date and have booster jabs if necessary. Your GP surgery can check your existing vaccination records. People in certain risk groups may be offered extra vaccines. These include vaccinations against diseases such as hepatitis B, tuberculosis (TB), flu and chickenpox.

Who should have the hepatitis A vaccine People usually advised to have the hepatitis A vaccine include: close contacts of someone with hepatitis A people planning to travel to or live in parts of the world where hepatitis A is widespread, particularly if levels of sanitation and food hygiene are expected to be poor people with any type of long-term (chronic) liver disease men who have sex with other men people who inject illegal drugs people who may be exposed to hepatitis A through their job – this includes sewage workers, staff of institutions where levels of personal hygiene may be poor (such as a homeless shelter) and people working with monkeys, apes and gorillas Contact your GP surgery if you think you should have the hepatitis A vaccine or you''re not sure whether you need it. Types of hepatitis A vaccine There are three main types of hepatitis A vaccination: a vaccine for hepatitis A only a combined vaccine for hepatitis A and hepatitis B a combined vaccine for hepatitis A and typhoid fever Talk to your GP about which vaccine is most suitable for you. All three types are usually available for free on the NHS. If you''ve travelling abroad, try to plan your vaccinations in advance. They should ideally be started at least two or three weeks before you leave, although some can be given up to the day of your departure if necessary. Extra doses of the vaccine are often recommended after 6-12 months if you need long-term protection. You can find more information about the various hepatitis A vaccines on the NHS Fit for Travel website. Side effects of the hepatitis A vaccine Some people develop temporary soreness, redness and hardening of the skin at the injection site after having the hepatitis A vaccine. A small, painless lump may also form, but this usually disappears quickly and isn''t a cause for concern.

Getting the best out of palliative care - Joe and Melita''s story Media last reviewed: 12/05/2016 Next review due: 12/05/2018 Caring for someone can become a major part of your life. When that person dies, as well as being a huge loss to you personally, it can leave a space in your life that can at first be hard to fill, especially if you''re feeling unsure of yourself. This article gives advice on how to register a death and ways that a carer can move on with their lives afterwards. How to register a death When somebody dies, you normally need to register their death within five days. The death has to be registered at a register office and takes about half an hour. It can be quicker to go to the register office in the area where the person you cared for died. If you go to another area it may take longer to get the documents needed and slow down the funeral arrangements. Before a death can be formally registered, a doctor will need to issue a medical certificate giving the cause of death. In hospital, this is usually done by a hospital doctor. If the person has not been seen by a hospital doctor, their GP may be able to issue a certificate instead. When you get the medical certificate which confirms that the person has died, ask for the address of the local register office. You can search for the local register office online, or look in the local phone book. Many register offices only see people by appointment, so phone before you go and make an appointment if you need to. In most cases a death is registered by a relative. If the person you cared for doesn''t have any family who can register their death, the registrar will allow other people to do this. As long as the person died at home or in hospital, their death can be registered by someone who was with them when they died, someone who lived in the same house, an official from the hospital, or the person who is arranging the funeral with the funeral directors. What documents do I need to register a death? You will need to take some documents with you when you go to register a death. You need:  the medical certificate, showing the cause of death and signed by a doctor The following are not essential, but if you can find them, you should also take the person’s: birth certificate marriage or civil partnership certificate their NHS medical card What other information will the registrar need? The registrar will require the following information from you: the person’s full name as it was when they died any names they used in the past, including their maiden name their date and place of birth (town and county if born in the UK and country if born abroad) their last address their occupation the full name, date of birth and occupation of their surviving wife, husband or civil partner details of any state pension or other state benefit they were receiving Death certificates Once the death has been registered, the registrar will give you two important documents. One is a Certificate for Burial and Cremation, also known as the green form. This gives permission for the person’s body to be buried or for an application for cremation to be made. Give this to the funeral director. You will also be given a Certificate of Registration of Death (form BD8, also known as a death certificate). This is for use in social security matters; for instance, dealing with the deceased person''s state pension or other benefits. You can buy extra copies of the death certificate when you register a death. You will need these to give to the executor or administrator who is dealing with affairs such as the person''s will. The registrar will give you a booklet that contains advice on several subjects, including paying for the funeral, probate and property, and other practical advice including what to do if the person you cared for died abroad, or in Scotland or Northern Ireland. For more information see GOV.UK: what to do after someone dies.  Moving on as a carer Having more time for yourself can give you the opportunity to see old friends again, to take up old hobbies, and to learn something new. You can refresh skills that you didn''t use while you were a carer, learn new skills, or make use of new interests or skills that you''ve gained from being a carer.  Volunteering after caring For example, you could get involved with a relevant charity through which you could use skills you’ve learnt from caring for the person who has died, to help others in their memory. Find out more about volunteering. Training courses after caring There are many courses you can take, either to learn something new or to expand your existing knowledge. Courses are also a great way to meet new people. You can find out about local courses from your library, adult education centres or through the National Careers Service on 0800 100 900.  Returning to work after caring If caring for someone meant you had to give up a job, or you''ve never been able to work at all, returning to work may be something that interests you. If you''re not sure what you want to do, think about the knowledge and skills you already have, and how you could use them. Include past paid work, voluntary work, hobbies and interests, and the skills you''ve gained as a carer or parent. Think about what you like doing, how you''d like to use your skills, and anything that you used to do and have missed. Before you start seriously thinking about going back to work, consider a personal development training course. It can help to build your confidence and manage stress, and provide assertiveness training. City and Guilds is a provider of vocational qualifications, including an Employability and Personal Development course.  The course covers a variety of topic areas that could be useful for carers looking to make a change, including:  preparing for employment succeeding at work independent living community involvement More information Visit the NHS Choices End of life care guide for more information about end-of-life issues.

Before that, a vaccine called Cervarix was used. Like all vaccines, the safety and effectiveness of Gardasil has been rigorously tested in clinical trials. A vaccine is only released to the public if scientific tests, called clinical trials, show the benefits outweigh the risks. The data from these trials was reviewed by the European Medicine Agency''s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use before a licence was granted for Gardasil''s use in the UK. Monitoring safety of HPV vaccines The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) collects information from doctors, other healthcare professionals and patients regarding suspected adverse reactions (unwanted reactions following administration of a medicine, including vaccines) through the Yellow Card scheme. These reports, or yellow cards, are recorded and regularly reviewed. If a potential problem is identified, an investigation will be carried out and if necessary appropriate action taken. There is also a legal requirement for pharmaceutical companies to report serious and suspected adverse events to the MHRA. To find out more, read Vaccine safety and side-effects. The safety record of Gardasil The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have carefully monitored the use of the Gardasil vaccine in the USA where it has been widely used for many years. The FDA reported that ‘Gardasil continues to be safe and effective and its benefits outweigh its risk’. For isolated cases of other medical conditions reported, the available evidence at the moment does not suggest that vaccines caused these conditions. When risks of the HPV vaccines are weighed against the benefit of protection from cervical cancer and genital warts, for most people the benefit of the vaccine far outweighs the risk.

There are many care options available, but which kind of support is right for you? Think about what you get most out of in life. You may have particular interests that you want to keep up, or you may simply want to spend time with your family or friends. You may have a job that you want to keep on doing, or a social activity, sport, religion or a political group that you want to keep up with. Your social care support should – as much as possible – help you to continue to do these things, and may help you find new things to do. When choosing the type of care, you also need to think about: location services standards and quality price Location of your care Your own home is often the best place for you to get care services. At home is where you may have family and friends and you’ll be in a familiar and hopefully safe environment. You may want to get help at home, perhaps through having home help come in to help you with daily tasks. To stay independently at home, you may need to have care services in the form of adaptations to your home (to help with mobility, for example) or perhaps just equipment to help you out. However, your home may not always be the best environment if you have care needs. It may not be safe for you, particularly if you do not have a friend or relative around to help (if you live in an isolated rural area, for example). Or you may have particular needs that cannot be easily met in your home. If you do need to move out of your home for care reasons, there is a variety of accommodation options that you may want to consider. These include sheltered housing, extra care housing and residential care homes or nursing homes. If you are thinking about moving, it''s worth considering whether it is best to stay in the area you are in now, which you will be familiar with, or whether you should move elsewhere to be nearer family or friends. You may also want to think about the location from a practical perspective (whether it''s on a bus route, for example) or for more personal reasons (such as whether you like the surroundings). The kinds of care services on offer If you are choosing a care service – particularly if it''s an ongoing service such as home care or a place in a care home, you should think about the particular things you want from the service (this will often be referred to as your "outcomes"). Use the services search to find out about the location, services, facilities, staff and performance of a Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered care home or homecare provider. Your search results should tell you whether a service can support you if you have particular needs, such as a sensory impairment or a learning disability. If the service is not registered with the CQC, you may have to ask them directly for information about the services, and you may want to get independent verification, if any is available. Your local authority may have a list of local support providers, with information on each. Standards and quality of care Everyone has a right to expect certain standards in their care. Your care services should help keep you safe and well, but also treat you with dignity and respect. You should always be able to express a choice in your care. The standards for social care providers, such as care homes, are set out by the CQC. The CQC''s inspection reports will tell you which services are meeting the minimum requirements. If you do not think the service is meeting these requirements, you may want to make a complaint. Good quality services, in whatever form they take, will treat you as an individual and attend to your personal needs. If you have homecare, for instance, the care workers who come into your home should listen to your wishes and include you and your family in decisions and care. When choosing care, you might want to look out for services that are signed up to the social care commitment. Check how well your local authority social services are performing. The price of your care When choosing social care services, you will have to consider how much the services may cost. The cost of your care may reflect each of the aspects listed above: location, quality and the kinds of services offered. If you have had an assessment from your local authority, you may get services for free. However, many people have to pay for their own care services (self-funders), and even people who have care funded by the local authority will need to know about the costs of care if they are using a personal budget or a direct payment. To find out more, read How can I fund my care?  More information The Money Advice Service has more information on choosing the right sort of care services.

Are there any reasons why my baby shouldn''t have the Hib/MenC vaccine? Can Hib/Men C vaccine be given to older children and adults? What is Hib? What is meningococcal disease? Who should have Hib/Men C vaccination? The Hib/Men C vaccine is routinely offered to all babies at one year of age. Find out when your baby''s childhood vaccinations are due. How will I know when to take my baby for their Hib/Men C vaccination? You should receive an automatic appointment from your GP surgery or local child health clinic. If you have not received one, or have any concerns, contact them to make an appointment. Find vaccination tips for parents. What should I do if my baby had a bad reaction after a previous dose of Hib? The only medical reason for not giving the Hib/MenC vaccine is if your baby had a confirmed anaphylactic reaction (serious allergic reaction) to a previous dose of the Hib-containing vaccine, the 5-in-1 vaccine, given at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age. If your baby had other side effects after a previous dose of Hib vaccine, they can still receive further doses because the benefits of the protection given against these diseases far outweigh the discomfort of side effects. Read more about Hib/Men C side effects. Can my child cope with being given so many vaccines when they''re so young? Yes. The vaccines that babies are given in the first year of life are minor compared with the tens of thousands of bacteria and viruses in the environment that babies have to cope with every day. Read more about why vaccines do not overload a child''s immune system. Can my child have the Hib/Men C, MMR, Men B and pneumo jabs all at the same time? Yes, it is safe and recommended that these four vaccines are given together at one year of age. Ideally, each injection should be given in a different part of your baby''s body, so probably in each arm and each leg. Are there any reasons why a baby shouldn''t have the Hib/Men C vaccine? There are very few reasons why babies cannot be immunised, however the Hib/Men C vaccine should not be given to babies who have had a confirmed anaphylactic reaction (serious allergic reaction) to a previous dose of the Hib vaccine, or to any component of the vaccine. Can the Hib/Men C vaccine be given to older children and adults? The Hib/Men C vaccine is not licensed for older children and adults. What is Hib? Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) is an infection that can cause a number of serious illnesses such as pneumonia, meningitis and blood poisoning. What is meningococcal disease? Meningococcal disease is a bacterial infection that commonly affects the protective membranes that surround the brain (causing meningitis) or the blood (causing blood poisoning). The Men C part of this vaccine only protects you against meningococcal meningitis, and not against any other type of meningitis. Read more about the Hib/Men C vaccine.

Making a complaint through the right channels could result in a better outcome for you, and may help improve things for other people, too. Please don''t be reluctant to come forward if you feel something is wrong. Click on the links below to be taken to complaints about: Assessments Benefit decisions Children''s services A care home or care services NHS services Complaints about assessments If you, or someone you''re looking after if you''re a carer, wants to complain about a decision made by social services, you can use the statutory complaints system. If you want to complain about your local authority, you should do so in writing or verbally to the complaints manager within 12 months. The local authority should acknowledge it has received your complaint within three working days. It will inform you of how long your complaint is likely to take to investigate. The local authority must respond fully within six months, unless a different time period has been discussed and agreed with you. Each local authority is responsible for arrangements for dealing with complaints, so contact your local authority for a copy of their complaints procedure. Taking your complaint further If you are not satisfied with the response you receive from your local authority, you are entitled to ask the independent Local Government Ombudsman (LGO) to investigate. The Ombudsman can investigate complaints about local councils. Further information is available on the LGO website. In some cases where there is a serious error of law, it may be possible to apply to the High Court for a judicial review of the decision made by the local authority. The time limit for applying for permission for a judicial review is three months from the date of the decision you want to complain about. This three-month maximum period of time is strictly applied. This type of legal action can be expensive, unless you qualify for public funding – find out more about legal aid. You will need the help of a solicitor who specialises in community care law. To find a qualified solicitor, visit the Law Society website, or contact the Citizens Advice Bureau. Complaints about benefit decisions If you are unhappy about the way your claim for benefits has been processed or the way you have been treated, you may wish to make a complaint. You would normally need to take the following action if your complaint is about the service from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP): First, contact the person who was dealing with your claim or that person''s manager. There is no need to wait until there has been a decision on the claim. If you are not satisfied, you can then ask for the details of the district manager of that benefit office and contact them with your complaint.  If you are still not satisfied, you can contact the chief executive of the DWP. The district manager will give you the contact details. If you are still not happy, you can then ask the independent case examiner to look at your complaint, particularly if it involves failure to follow proper procedures, excessive delays, or poor customer service. You should normally contact the independent case examiner no later than six months after the final response from the DWP is received. The independent case examiner can be reached on 0845 606 0777 (textphone 0151 801 8888). Complaints about tax credits are dealt with by HM Revenue and Customs, but work in a similar way. Read more about complaining about a tax credit decision. You can ask your MP to take up the complaint on your behalf at any stage. He or she may agree to refer the matter to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. The Ombudsman would investigate your case if they think you may have experienced injustice because of the action or inaction of the DWP. The DWP has target times to process claims for different benefits. If the claim takes too long to process, you may be entitled to compensation. How can I complain about how an appeal was handled? If the complaint is about the way your appeal has been processed – for example, you were not sent paperwork – contact the Tribunals Service. If you''re concerned about the way members of a tribunal behaved during an appeal hearing, you would need to contact the chair of the region where the tribunal was heard. To find out who this is, contact the Tribunals Service. Complaints about children''s services Local authorities have procedures to deal with complaints from children and young people, or from people complaining on their behalf, such as parents and guardians. Complaints about children''s services normally need to be made within 12 months, but the local authority can consider complaints made later than this. If it decides not to deal with the complaint, it should tell you why. If you''re not happy with the local authority''s decision regarding your complaint, you can get help from the Local Government Ombudsman. The complaints process should take into account the concerns of the child or young person involved, and should be appropriate for their age and level of understanding. If the child or young person wants to make a complaint themselves, the local authority should provide information about advocacy services and help them access these. As with adult complaints, you should address your complaint to the manager of the service you are complaining about at first. Local authorities aim to have your complaint resolved at the local level within 10 working days, although this can be extended. Investigation of complaints If the complaint isn''t resolved locally, it can be investigated further by an investigating officer from the local authority and an independent person. This investigation should take no longer than 25 working days, although again this can be extended. The investigating officer will produce a written report, including each point of complaint and whether it is upheld or not upheld, along with recommendations about actions that should be taken to address any upheld complaints. The independent person should write a report for the local authority stating whether they think the investigation was carried out fairly, and if the investigating officer''s report gives an accurate picture of the investigation. A senior manager from the local authority will "adjudicate" the investigation and decide how the local authority will respond to each point of complaint, as well as outlining any action to be taken and when it should be completed by. Review of complaints If you are not satisfied with the outcome of the investigation into your complaint, you can ask for a review of the complaint. The complaint will then be reviewed by an independent panel. The panel will listen to everyone involved in the complaint and, where possible, work towards a resolution. You have the right to attend the review panel and to talk about your complaint and the outcomes you would like to see. You also have the right to be accompanied by another person, who can speak on your behalf if you want. When the review panel has made its decision, it must send you a written report summarising its recommendations. The local authority must send you its response to the panel''s report, setting out what action it will take in response to the panel''s recommendations. Local Government Ombudsman If you''ve gone through the local authority''s complaints procedure for children''s services and are unhappy with the result or the way your complaint was dealt with, you can get help from the Local Government Ombudsman. Complaints about care homes or care services You, or the person you''re looking after, may have a complaint about a residential care home. A complaint could be about the quality of care provided or the fees charged. There are a number of ways you can make a complaint.  If the care is funded or arranged by a local authority, that local authority is responsible for it, even if it is provided in an independent care home. You should complain to the local authority and the Local Government Ombudsman (as detailed above) if you are not satisfied with the response you receive.   If you are funding or arranging your own care, you should make a complaint to the care home operator. The law says all care homes must have an appropriate complaints procedure. If you''re worried about doing so, you can complain directly to the regulator responsible for all care homes and regulated care services instead.  Care home and care services regulation At present, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) is responsible for regulating care homes and all regulated care services. It monitors, inspects and regulates services to make sure they meet fundamental standards of quality and safety. Its role is to ensure the services comply with regulations and quality standards.  If you have experienced poor care or know that poor care is being provided somewhere, you can report it to the CQC, anonymously if you wish. You can also tell them when you have received good care.   Local authority complaints If the local authority is responsible for placing the person you''re looking after in a care home or for creating a care plan for them, or arranging their care for them, it is possible to use their statutory social services complaints system to make a complaint.  If the local authority complaints procedure does not resolve the complaint, it may be possible to use other complaints methods, such as the LGO.   If you do complain to the CQC or local authority, they should liaise with the care home or care service to ensure that you receive a co-ordinated response.  Who to complain to if you''re paying for your own care If you''re a "self-funder" – paying for your own care costs – you can take the complaints to the LGO if you''re not satisfied with the outcome of the initial direct complaint to the care provider, or the response from the local authority. But remember, the complaint can only be made to the local authority if they had a hand in helping you arrange your care.  Complaints about abuse or neglect Some of the most serious complaints involve alleged physical or psychological abuse or neglect within the care home. If you believe this may have occurred, contact the local authority as quickly as possible.  Each local authority has a safeguarding team responsible for responding to allegations, even if the local authority wasn''t involved in arranging residential care. The local authority will liaise with the police and the CQC if appropriate. Find out more about supporting vulnerable adults and safeguarding.  Making a complaint about NHS services If you want to complain about an NHS service such as a hospital, GP or dentist, ask the service for a copy of their complaints procedure, which will explain what you need to do. If you speak to them, they may be able to resolve your concerns without you having to go through the complaints process. However, you may choose to make a complaint at any time. You can do this in writing, by email, or by speaking to them. This is called the local resolution stage, and it aims to resolve complaints quickly – most cases are resolved at this stage. If you would like to make a complaint, follow the NHS complaints process. You may make a complaint to either the organisation that provided your healthcare or the organisation that commissioned that NHS service. The commissioning body will be the local clinical commissioning group (CCG) for hospital care, NHS England for GP, dental, pharmacy and optical services, or your local authority for complaints about public health services. The time limit for a complaint is normally 12 months from the date the event happened, or from the date you first became aware of it. Find tips on how to complain about NHS services. The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman The Health Service Ombudsman considers complaints about the NHS in England that have not been resolved locally. The Ombudsman investigates whether the NHS has acted properly or fairly, or if they have provided a poor service. The Ombudsman independently investigates complaints and can look at complaints about hospitals, GPs, dentists, pharmacists, opticians, nurses, ambulances, and others providing NHS services. Try to resolve the complaint with the relevant organisation yourself first, or with the help of an advocate. The Ombudsman generally only acts after the organisation has been given a chance to respond and act to make amends (if appropriate). To make a complaint now, go to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman website.  Page last reviewed: 15/01/2015 Next review due: 15/01/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

(201, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/child-flu-vaccine.aspx', 'Children''s annual flu vaccine', 'Children''s flu vaccine - Vaccinations - NHS Choices', '', 'The children''s flu vaccine is offered as a yearly nasal spray to young children to help protect them against flu. Flu can be a very unpleasant illness for children with potentially serious complications, including bronchitis and pneumonia. At what age should children have the nasal spray flu vaccine? In the autumn/winter of 2016-17, the vaccine will be available free on the NHS for eligible children, including: children aged two, three and four on August 31 2016 – that is, children born between September 1 2011 and August 31 2014 children in school years one, two and three in some parts of the country, all primary school-aged children will be offered the vaccine as part of a test programme children aged 2 to 17 with long-term health conditions Over the next few years the programme will be extended gradually to include older children. Who will give the children''s flu vaccination? Children aged two, three and four years will be given the vaccination at their general practice, usually by the practice nurse. Children that are 5 years old are also eligible for flu vaccination provided they were 4 on the 31 August 2016. These children should be offered flu vaccination at their general practice as they will not be offered it in reception year at school. Children in school years one, two and three are likely to have their vaccination in school. In some areas it may be offered in other community health settings. Children at higher risk from flu Children aged 2 to 17 with long-term health conditions such as diabetes are at higher risk from flu. It''s especially important that they are vaccinated with the annual flu nasal spray instead of the annual flu jab, which they were previously given. Children between the ages of six months and two years who are at high risk from flu are offered the annual flu jab, usually at their GP surgery. What are the side effects of the flu vaccine for children? The nasal spray flu vaccine has very few side effects – the main one is getting a runny nose after vaccination for a few days. Read more about the side effects of the flu vaccine for children. How to get the flu vaccine for your child Your child''s GP or school should contact you about getting them vaccinated before the winter. Talk to the GP, practice nurse or your child''s school nurse if you want more information about when and how your child will be vaccinated against flu. If you haven''t heard from their GP by early November 2016, contact them directly to make an appointment. How is the nasal spray flu vaccine given? The vaccine is given as a single spray squirted up each nostril. Not only is it needle-free – a big advantage for children – the nasal spray is quick, painless, and works even better than the injected flu vaccine. The vaccine is absorbed very quickly. It will still work even if, after the vaccination, your child develops a runny nose, sneezes or blows their nose. Read the patient information leaflet for the nasal spray flu vaccine (PDF, 221kb). Are there any children who should delay having the nasal spray flu vaccine? Children should have their nasal spray flu vaccination delayed if they: have a runny or blocked nose are wheezy If a child has a heavily blocked or runny nose, it might stop the vaccine getting into their system. In this case, their flu vaccination should be postponed until their nasal symptoms have cleared up. If a child is wheezy or has been wheezy in the past week, their vaccination should be postponed until they have been wheeze-free for at least three days. Are there any children who should not have the nasal spray flu vaccine? There are a few children who should avoid the nasal spray flu vaccine. The vaccine is not recommended for children who have: a severely weakened immune system severe egg allergy severe asthma – that is, those being treated with steroid tablets or high-dose inhaled steroids an allergy to any of the vaccine ingredients, such as neomycin Children unable to have the nasal spray vaccine may be able to have the injectable flu vaccine instead. Why children are offered flu vaccine Flu is a very common infection in babies and children. It can be very unpleasant for them. Children with flu have the same symptoms as adults – including fever, chills, aching muscles, headache, stuffy nose, dry cough and a sore throat lasting up to a week. Some children develop a very high fever or complications of flu, such as bronchitis, pneumonia and a painful middle ear infection. They may need hospital treatment, and very occasionally a child may die from flu. In fact, healthy children under the age of five are more likely to have to be admitted to hospital with flu than any other age group. For children with long-term health conditions such as diabetes, asthma, heart disease or lung disease, getting flu can be very serious as they are more at risk of developing serious complications. Learn about the five reasons to vaccinate your child against flu (PDF, 461kb). Read more about the complications of flu. How safe is the flu vaccine for children? The flu vaccine for children has a good safety record. In the UK, millions of children have been vaccinated safely and successfully. How does the children''s flu vaccine work? The vaccine contains live but weakened flu viruses that do not cause flu in children. It will help your child build up immunity to flu in a similar way as natural infection, but without the symptoms. Because the main flu viruses change each year, a new nasal spray vaccine has to be given each year, in the same way as the injectable flu vaccine. Stopping the spread of flu The nasal spray flu vaccine will not only help protect your child against flu, the infection will also be less able to spread from them to their family, carers and the wider population. Children spread flu because they generally don''t use tissues properly or wash their hands. Vaccinating children also protects others that are vulnerable to flu, such as babies, older people, pregnant women and people with serious long-term illnesses. Read more about how flu is spread. How many doses of the flu vaccine do children need? Most children only need a single dose of the nasal spray. The patient information leaflet provided with the nasal spray suggests children should be given two doses of this vaccine if they''ve not had flu vaccine before. However, the NHS vaccination programme has advised that healthy children only need a single dose because a second dose of the vaccine provides little additional protection. Children aged two to nine years at risk of flu because of an underlying medical condition, who have not received flu vaccine before, should have two doses of the nasal spray given at least four weeks apart.

(202, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/benefits-and-risks.aspx', NULL, 'Benefits and risks of vaccination - Vaccinations - NHS Choices', '', 'All medicines have side effects. However, vaccines are among the safest and the benefits of vaccinations far outweigh the risk of side effects. When you''re considering a vaccination for yourself or your child, it''s natural to focus on the potential side effects. But a better approach is to try to balance the benefits of having a vaccine against the chances of harm. What are the side effects of vaccination? Most side effects from vaccination are mild and short-lived. Common side effects It''s quite common to have redness or swelling around the injection site, but this soon goes away. Younger children or babies may be a bit irritable or unwell, or have a slight temperature. Again, this usually goes away within one or two days. Read this NHS leaflet about the common side effects of vaccinations in babies and children up to five years of age (PDF, 118kb). Rare side effects In much rarer cases, some people have an allergic reaction soon after a vaccination. This is usually a rash or itching that affects part or all of the body. The GPs and nurses who give the vaccine are trained in how to treat this. On very rare occasions, a severe allergic reaction may happen within a few minutes of the vaccination. This is called an anaphylactic reaction. It can lead to breathing difficulties and, in some cases, collapse. Remember that anaphylactic reactions are extremely rare (less than one in a million). Vaccination staff are trained to deal with this, and these reactions are completely reversible if treated promptly. Find out how to report a side effect of a vaccination. The benefits of vaccination Vaccination is different from giving medicine to an unwell child to make them better. The benefits of vaccination are invisible. The idea is that your child won''t become ill with measles or end up in intensive care with meningitis. It may be tempting to say "no" to vaccination and "leave it to nature". However, deciding not to vaccinate your child puts them at risk of catching a range of potentially serious, even fatal, diseases. In reality, having a vaccination is much safer than not having one. They''re not 100% effective in every child, but they''re the best defence against the epidemics that used to kill or permanently disable millions of children and adults.

How is the vaccine given? If I was vaccinated against tetanus, diphtheria and polio as a child, am I still protected? Can you get polio from the polio part of this vaccine? How many boosters do I need to have? What are the most common side effects from the Td/IPV booster? Are there any people who should not be vaccinated?

What should I do if my child is unwell after receiving this vaccine? What is diphtheria? What is tetanus? What is polio? Who should have the vaccination? The 3-in-1 teenage booster vaccine is routinely offered on the NHS to all young people aged 14 (school year 9). How is the 3-in-1 teenage booster given? It is injected into the upper arm. If I was vaccinated against tetanus, diphtheria and polio as a child, am I still protected? You will have some protection, but this booster vaccination will top up your level of antibodies and help keep you protected for many more years. Can you get polio from the polio part of this vaccine? The teenage booster vaccine contains inactivated (killed) polio vaccine, which cannot cause polio. How many boosters do I need to have? In total, you need five doses of the tetanus, diphtheria and polio vaccines through your life to build up and maintain your immunity. The first three doses are received as a baby as the 5-in-1 vaccine, the fourth dose is given around the age of three as a pre-school booster known as the 4-in-1 vaccine, and the fifth and final dose is the teenage 3-in-1 booster given at age 14 (school year 9). If you think you may have missed any of your doses, talk to your doctor, practice nurse or school nurse. What are the most common side effects of the teenage 3-in-1 booster? It''s usual to get some swelling and redness at the site of the injection as a side effect of the teenage booster, but this is minor and goes away quickly. A small painless lump sometimes develops, but it usually disappears in a few weeks. Are there any people who should not be given the 3-in-1 teenage booster? There are very few young people who cannot be given the teenage booster. However, you should not have the 3-in-1 teenage booster jab if you have had an anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) to a previous dose. If you are ill with a fever, you should also postpone vaccination until you are better. This is so any symptoms of any existing illness cannot be confused with an adverse reaction to the vaccine. Should I have any other vaccinations at the same time as the teenage booster? You will probably have the Men ACWY vaccine at the same time as your 3-in-1 vaccine. It''s also a good opportunity to check with the doctor or nurse that all your other vaccinations are up to date – for example, MMR and (for some people) hepatitis B. If not, you can have these vaccines at the same time as the 3-in-1 vaccine. For more information, see the NHS vaccination schedule. This NHS leaflet tells you more about immunisations at secondary school. Can the teenage booster be given with other vaccines? Yes, the 3-in-1 teenage booster can be given at the same time as other routine childhood vaccinations. What does the teenage 3-in-1 booster contain? The 3-in-1 teenage booster is a combined vaccine that contains: purified diphtheria toxoid (low dose) purified tetanus toxoid three types of inactivated (killed) polio virus The 3-in-1 vaccine does not contain thiosermal, a mercury-based preservative. Read more about vaccine ingredients. What should I do if my child is unwell after receiving the teenage booster jab? A few young people may develop a mild fever after vaccination. If this happens, make sure they have plenty of cool drinks, and you can give them paracetamol or ibuprofen (aspirin must not be given to children under the age of 16). What is diphtheria? Diphtheria is a serious bacterial disease that usually begins with a sore throat and can quickly develop to cause problems with breathing. It can damage the heart and nervous system, and can kill. Diphtheria can be spread by close contact with an infected person. What is tetanus? Tetanus is a painful disease that affects the muscles and can cause severe breathing problems. It is caused by the tetanus toxin released by bacteria that are found in soil and manure. The bacteria can get into the body through cuts or burns. Tetanus can kill. What is polio? Polio is a virus that attacks the nervous system and can permanently paralyse the muscles in the arms and legs. If it affects the chest muscles, it can be fatal.

(210, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/pneumococcal-vaccination.aspx', 'Pneumococcal vaccine', 'Pneumococcal vaccine - Vaccinations - NHS Choices', '', 'The pneumococcal vaccine protects against serious and potentially fatal pneumococcal infections. It''s also known as the "pneumo jab" or pneumonia vaccine. Pneumococcal infections are caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae and can lead to pneumonia, septicaemia (a kind of blood poisoning) and meningitis. At their worst, they can cause permanent brain damage, or even kill. This page covers: Who should have the pneumococcal vaccine How often is the pneumococcal vaccine given The different types of pneumococcal vaccine How the pneumococcal vaccine works Who shouldn''t have the pneumococcal vaccine Side effects of the pneumococcal vaccine Who should have the pneumococcal vaccine? A pneumococcal infection can affect anyone. However, some people are at higher risk of serious illness and can be given the pneumococcal vaccination on the NHS. These include: babies  adults aged 65 or over children and adults with certain long-term health conditions, such as a serious heart or kidney condition Read more about who should have the pneumo jab. How often is the pneumococcal vaccine given? Babies receive the pneumococcal vaccine as three separate injections, at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and one year old. People over 65 only need a single pneumococcal vaccination, which will protect for life. It is not given annually like the flu jab. People with a long-term health condition may need just a single one-off pneumococcal vaccination or five-yearly vaccination, depending on their underlying health problem. The different types of pneumonia vaccine The type of pneumococcal vaccine you are given depends on your age and health. The two types are: pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) – this is used to vaccinate children under two years old as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. It''s known by the brand name Prevenar 13. Read the patient information leaflet for Prevenar 13. pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) – this is given to people aged 65 and over, and to people at high risk due to long-term health conditions. Read the patient information leaflet for PPV.  Children at risk of pneumococcal infections can have the PPV vaccine from the age of two years onwards. It''s thought not to work in children under the age of two.  How the pneumococcal vaccine works Both types of pneumococcal vaccine encourage your body to produce antibodies against pneumococcal bacteria. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body to neutralise or destroy disease-carrying organisms and toxins. They protect you from becoming ill if you are infected with the bacteria. More than 90 different strains of the pneumococcal bacterium have been identified, though only 8 to 10 of them cause the most serious infections. The childhood vaccine (PCV) protects against 13 strains of the pneumococcal bacterium, while the adult vaccine (PPV) protects against 23 strains. The pneumococcal vaccine is thought to be around 50-70% effective at preventing pneumococcal disease. Both the PPV and the PCV are inactivated or "killed" vaccines and do not contain any live organisms. They cannot cause the disease against which they protect.  Read more about killed vaccines. Who shouldn''t have the pneumo jab? Occasionally, you or your child may need to delay having the vaccination or avoid it completely because of the following: Vaccine allergy Tell your GP if you or your child has had a bad reaction to any vaccination in the past. If there''s been a confirmed severe allergic reaction, called an anaphylactic reaction, to the pneumococcal vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine, it''s best to avoid having it. However, if it was only a mild reaction, such as a rash, it is generally safe to have the vaccine. Fever at the vaccination appointment If you or your child are mildly unwell at the time of the vaccination, it''s safe to have the vaccine. However, if you or your child are more seriously ill – for example, with a high temperature – it''s best to delay the vaccination until after recovery.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding It''s thought to be safe to have the pneumococcal vaccine during pregnancy and while you''re breastfeeding. But, as a precaution, if you are pregnant, you may want to wait until you have had your baby (unless the benefits of having the vaccine outweigh the risks to your child). Side effects of the pneumococcal vaccine Like most vaccines, the childhood and adult versions of the pneumococcal vaccine can sometimes cause mild side effects, including: a mild fever redness at the site of the injection hardness or swelling at the site of the injection There are no serious side effects listed for either the childhood or adult versions of the vaccine, apart from an extremely small risk of serious allergic reaction. Read about the side effects of the pneumococcal vaccination. This video tells the story of 11-year-old Sam, who had pneumococcal meningitis as a baby (before the childhood pneumococcal vaccine was introduced) and was left severely brain damaged.

(211, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/claiming-income-related-benefits.aspx', 'Claiming benefits', 'Claiming income-related benefits - Care and support guide - NHS Choices', '', 'If you think you may be entitled to an income-related benefit, such as Income Support, Housing Benefit, Jobseeker’s Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), or Pension Credit Guarantee Credit, you should make a claim as soon as possible. You can call 0800 055 6688 (8am-6pm Monday to Friday) to start a claim for most benefits. If you have a speech or hearing impairment, a textphone service is available on 0800 023 4888. Your basic details will be recorded and you’ll be called back to discuss your claim. This usually takes around 45 minutes and you may be sent a statement to sign, based on the information you''ve given. If you have trouble using the phone, you can claim most benefits online via GOV.UK. To avoid delays in your claim, make sure you have your National Insurance number. You may also be asked to prove your identity, your home address, income and savings, so your passport, household bills, wage slips and bank statements should also be to hand. Couples: who should claim benefits? If you''re in a couple, you may have to think about which one of you should make the claim. You might need advice about which benefit is the best to claim, as you may be eligible for different ones. Backdating your claim for income-related benefits Income-related benefits can be backdated for one month before your date of claim if, for example, your local office is closed and you can''t make other arrangements for claiming, you couldn''t reasonably get to or contact the office, you''ve claimed after separating from your partner or there were serious postal problems. In exceptional circumstances, income-related benefits can be backdated by up to three months. These circumstances include language difficulties, being given wrong information by Jobcentre Plus or an advice worker or solicitor, or you were having serious problems as a disabled person or a carer and you weren''t able to get help. Dealing with delays to your benefit claim If your first payday has been reached and your claim has not yet been decided, you may be able to ask for an advance of benefit. Advances are discretionary and can only be made to those who satisfy the conditions for an advance, including that the claimant or a member of their family is in financial need. If your claim or payment is seriously delayed, you may want to make a complaint. How changing circumstances affect income-related benefits If something happens that could change your entitlement to a benefit or the amount you''re paid, report it straight away. Tell the office that usually deals with your claim for income-related benefit (contact details will be on letters they''ve sent you). Some benefits, such as Carer’s Allowance or Disability Living Allowance (DLA), may increase the amount of income-related benefits you can get. Make sure you tell the office that deals with your claim, so that you don’t lose out on any extra money you may be due from disability or carer premium payments. It''s best to report in writing anything that may change your entitlement to a benefit, in case there''s confusion over what you did. You need to report changes in circumstances straight away because if you''re paid too much benefit, it may be claimed back from you. Many overpayments are caused by innocent mistakes, but if you’re accused of acting dishonestly or fraudulently, you should seek urgent legal advice. Benefit fraud If you deliberately give incorrect or misleading information or fail to report a change of circumstances, you may be committing benefit fraud. Benefit fraud is a criminal offence and you can be prosecuted or asked to pay a penalty. If you''re being investigated for benefit fraud, your benefit will be suspended. If you''re convicted of benefit fraud more than once, your benefit may be reduced or stopped in the future.  Changes in circumstances The following scenarios are examples of when you may need to report a change in circumstances: If you''re admitted to hospital as an inpatient, your entitlement to income-related benefits continues, but you may have to report that you''re in hospital if you get DLA, Attendance Allowance (AA) or Personal Independence Payment (PIP). This is because payment of these should stop after 28 days in hospital. Any Severe Disability Premium you get should also stop at this point. For more information, read this Age UK leaflet on going into hospital (PDF, 2Mb). If you go home for a few days, even just for a weekend, tell the relevant offices that deal with each of your benefits. This is because although benefits may be reduced or stop while you''re in hospital, you''re entitled to the full rate for any days that you spend at home. You may need to send confirmation from the hospital of the dates that you spend at home. If you''re a carer and you’re getting a carer premium on your benefit and the person you''re looking after goes into hospital, your premium will stop eight weeks after their DLA, AA or PIP stops. If you''re a resident in a care home, your income-related benefit won''t stop. However, your benefit will usually go towards paying your costs of staying in the home. You should be left with the "personal allowance" element of your benefit. If you enter a care home on a permanent basis, your claim may be treated differently if you''re part of a couple or you own your own home. If you become a permanent care home resident, you will be treated as a single person for benefit purposes, so you and your partner will need to make separate claims as single people. If you''re a permanent care home resident, your house will be treated as capital, which may mean that you''re no longer entitled to your income-related benefit. However, it will not be treated as capital if: it''s occupied by your current partner it''s occupied by a relative as their home, if that person is over 60 or "incapacitated"  it''s occupied by a former partner from whom you''re estranged or divorced, if they''re a lone parent you''re taking steps to sell the property; in this case, its value is ignored for 26 weeks (or for longer, if it''s reasonable under the circumstances) – read about deferred payment agreements You can claim income-related benefits if you''re in part-time education. How income-related benefit is worked out How much of the income-related benefit you get depends on the weekly amount the government thinks you need to live on. This is known as your "applicable amount" for most income-related benefits except Pension Credit Guarantee Credit. The applicable amount varies for each person because it''s made up of different elements, which depend on your circumstances. First, there''s a basic amount called the "personal allowance". This has different rates, depending on your age and whether you''re a single person or part of a couple. Extra sums for extra costs As well as personal allowance, some people are allowed extra amounts called "premiums". These are paid if you have a disability or you''re a carer or an older person. Some housing costs for your mortgage or home loan interest can also be added to your personal allowance and any premiums you''re entitled to. Added together, these amounts make up your applicable amount. The amount of benefit you will be paid is the difference between your applicable amount and your income. In other words, income-related benefits tops up your income to the level the government thinks you will need to live on. You will only be entitled to the benefit if your income is less than your applicable amount. If you have no income, or all your income is disregarded, you will get the benefit at the level of your applicable amount. Otherwise, your benefit level will be your applicable amount minus your income. This means that any extra income you receive each week, if it''s taken into account, will reduce the amount of benefit you''re paid. Pension Credit Guarantee Credit works in a similar way, but is based on a standard minimum guarantee, with additions for things such as disability and housing costs. Premiums Premiums are extra amounts for special needs, such as those caused by disability or if you''re a carer. If you add together your personal allowance, any premiums you qualify for and any mortgage help that you qualify for, this will give you your applicable amount, which is the amount that the law says you need to live on. Disability premium A disability premium can be added if: you or your partner receive disability benefits you or your partner are registered blind you have been incapable of work and on statutory sick pay for 196 days, and you''re terminally ill To qualify for disability premium, you must be under the age for Pension Credit eligibility. For couples, a couple rate of disability premium will be paid, even if only one of you qualifies. If you''re claiming because you have been incapable of work for a year, the claimant must be the disabled person, otherwise a disability premium will not be paid. Severe disability premium A severe disability premium is added for people who are receiving certain disability benefits and who meet other conditions. You will qualify if you receive the middle or highest rate of the care component of DLA, or you receive AA at either rate, and you live alone (or are treated as living alone) and no one is paid Carer’s Allowance for looking after you. Severe disability premium is payable at the single rate in most circumstances. However, you may get the couple rate if both of you receive the middle or highest rate of the care component of DLA, AA or PIP at either rate, and nobody is paid Carer’s Allowance for looking after you. Enhanced disability premium An enhanced disability premium can be added to the other premiums if you (or your partner) are under pension age and getting DLA or PIP at the highest rate for care needs. A couple rate will be paid even if only one of you qualifies. Carer premium A carer premium can be added if you receive Carer’s Allowance for looking after a disabled person. It''s possible to get this premium if you care for your disabled partner. It''s also possible for both members of a couple to receive a carer premium if they meet the rules, as you could be each other’s carers. Occasionally, it may be worth you claiming Carer’s Allowance even though you receive another benefit that means you don''t get any money for being a carer, because the two benefits overlap. Capital and income When the amount of an income-related benefit you will get is worked out, your income and capital will be taken into account. You will need to give details of all your income and capital when you claim. Not all of it will count, but you should still show all the details. What is ‘capital’? Capital includes most things that you have saved up, such as money in the bank or building society, premium bonds, unit trusts, investments or stocks and shares. If you own property, the value of this may count. However, the house you live in, even if you own it, doesn''t count. If you''ve sold your home and you''re going to buy another one, the sum you set aside for this will not count for six months. For more information, see care homes. The rules about what counts as capital can be complicated, so you may wish to get further advice. Don''t be tempted to "get rid" of money (such as giving it to relatives) to get below the capital limits. Unless you have a good reason for spending the money, you may be treated as still having it, and you may still be refused benefit or receive reduced benefit. Income is the money that you and your partner (if applicable) get from – for example: part-time work other benefits rent from lodgers Most benefits and pensions that you receive will fully count as income. However, some benefits are either completely or partly ignored. This is called a "disregarded benefit". Payments from some charitable trusts, including the Macfarlane Trust, the Eileen Trust, the Skipton Fund, Independent Living Funds and the London Bombings Fund are ignored. Other regular charitable or voluntary payments are also ignored as income. If someone rents a room from you, but you don''t provide food for them, some of this rent is ignored and the rest counts as income. If you rent a room out and provide food (known as "board"), some of this rent is ignored, and half of the remainder will be counted as income. Now read about how to challenge a decision regarding your income-related benefits. The government''s official online source of information on ESA is GOV.UK.

(213, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/care-homes.aspx', 'Care homes', 'Care homes - Care and support guide - NHS Choices', '', 'If you''re looking for a residential care home, there''s a huge variety of options available. There are permanent care homes for older people, homes for younger adults with disabilities, and homes for children. Care homes may be privately owned or run by charities or councils. Some will be small care homes based in home-like domestic dwellings, while others will be based in large communal centres. One of the first options you have to consider when choosing residential care is whether you need the care home to provide nursing care, or just standard personal care. Consider other options for care first Going into a care home is a major commitment for your future – it involves changing where you live and potentially committing to paying a considerable amount of money for your ongoing accommodation and care needs. Before you opt for a move to a care home, you should think about other less disruptive – and potentially less costly – options, including: home care help to live independently at home a "shared lives" or "adult placement" scheme – usually suitable for the needs of younger disabled adults (aged 18 to 64) You should also consider whether you really need the amount of care on offer at a care home, and look at alternatives such as "extra care" housing schemes or warden-controlled sheltered accommodation. These options offer independence with an increased level of care and support. Personal care or nursing care? Care homes for older people may provide personal care or nursing care. A care home registered to provide personal care will offer support, ensuring basic personal needs are taken care of. A care home providing personal care only can assist you with meals, bathing, going to the toilet and taking medication, if you need this sort of help. Find care homes without nursing. Some residents may need nursing care, and some care homes are registered to provide this. These are often referred to as nursing homes. For example, a care home might specialise in certain types of disability or conditions such as dementia. Find care homes with nursing. Care homes for adults aged 18 to 65 There are also residential care homes that provide care and support for younger adults with, for example, severe physical disabilities, learning disabilities, brain injury resulting from an accident, or mental health problems. They can care for adults with more than one condition, and some homes will have expertise in providing care for adults with alcohol or drug dependency. These care homes may offer permanent residence or provide care for a temporary period. Residential care for children and adolescents Some care homes specialise in providing residential care for children with physical disabilities, learning disabilities or emotional problems. Residential special schools focus on education and provide teaching on-site. In some cases, care homes for children offer "transition" support for young people until they reach their early 20s. Choice of care home The law says that where the local authority is funding accommodation, it must allow a person entering residential care to choose which care home they would prefer, within reason. Social services must first agree the home is suitable for your needs and it would not cost more than you would normally pay for a home that would meet those needs. Local authority help with the cost of residential care is means-tested. You are free to make your own arrangements if you can afford the long-term cost. However, it is worth asking the local authority for a financial assessment, because it might pay some or all of your care costs. In the financial assessment, the local authority can only take into account income and assets you own. The local authority cannot ask members of your family to pay for the basic cost of your care. Read more about local authority funding for care and funding your own care. If you choose a care home that costs more than the local authority usually expects to pay for a person with your needs, you may still be able to live in the care home if a relative or friend is willing and able to pay the difference between what the local authority pays and the amount the care home charges – this is known as a "top-up" fee. However, if their situation changes and they are no longer able to pay the top-up, the local authority may have no obligation to continue to fund the more expensive care home place and you may have to move out. It is worth thinking about this potentially difficult situation when deciding on care home options. Read more about topping up. Do not cancel your tenancy or sell your home until the final decision has been made by the local authority. The value of your home must not be included in the local authority''s means-testing until 12 weeks after you''ve confirmed that the care home placement will be permanent. The Care Act 2014 is changing how people are able to pay for their own care, introducing the right for you to ask for the local authority to pay for the cost of your care while you try to sell your home. This is known as a "deferred payment scheme". Choosing a care home if you''re funding your own care If you are funding your own care, you have a great deal of options, and you will need to do a lot of research on which care home provides the best options for you in terms of its cost, location, services, and a host of other potential factors. Read on for tips on choosing your care home. One of the best places to start is by searching a directory of care homes with nursing, or searching a directory of care homes without nursing. Choosing a care home if you''re having care provided by the local authority After a needs assessment from social services, you will be provided with a care plan, which should make clear whether you need residential care and what other options, if any, might be available and most appropriate based on your needs. Even if you''re unlikely to be eligible for financial help with residential care home fees, it could still be worth involving social services. The needs assessment, and information they provide, are likely to be very helpful in making decisions about care. Tips on choosing a care home Check the most recent inspection report to see how well the care home is doing and if there is anything of concern. You can get inspection reports by searching for the care home on the Care Quality Commission website or Ofsted for children''s care homes. Consider the location of a care home. Is the care home near family and friends? Are there shops, leisure or educational facilities in the area? Is the area noisy? Is the care home focused on the residents'' individual needs, or do they insist that residents adapt to their routine?  What arrangements are there for visitors? Can residents come and go as they please, as far as it is safe to do so? Are staff able to help residents to go out? Are outings arranged? What involvement would you have in the care home? How would you communicate with staff? Are there any support groups or regular meetings? If safety and security are issues, what arrangements or supervision can the care home provide?  Will the care home meet your specific religious, ethnic, cultural or social needs? Will the correct diet be provided? Will the right language be spoken? Will there be opportunities to participate in religious activities? Do they allow pets? When you are choosing accommodation it may be a lifelong decision, so you may want to think about planning for end of life care at the same time. You might also want to check what people who have used the care home say about it from online feedback and review services, such as those put together on NHS Choices. Ask for a temporary stay in the care home before you decide. Temporary stays in care homes can also be arranged in certain circumstances, such as after a stay in hospital. A good care home will: offer new residents and their families or carers a guide (in a variety of accessible formats) describing what they can expect while they''re living there have staff who have worked there for a long time, know the residents well, and are friendly, supportive and respectful employ well-trained staff, particularly where specialist care such as dementia nursing is required involve residents, carers and their families in decision-making support residents in doing things for themselves and maximising their independence offer a choice of tasty and nutritious food, and provide a variety of leisure and social activities taking residents'' needs into account be a clean, bright and hygienic environment that''s adapted appropriately for residents, with single bedrooms available respect residents'' privacy, modesty, dignity and choices be accredited under the Gold Standards Framework for end of life care An unsatisfactory care home might: have a code of practice, but not adhere to it fail to take into account residents'' needs and wishes, with most decisions made by staff let residents'' care plans become out of date, or fail to reflect their needs accurately have staff who enter residents'' rooms without knocking, and talk about residents within earshot of other people deny residents their independence – for example, by not allowing someone to feed themselves because it "takes too long" have staff who don''t make an effort to interact with residents and leave them sitting in front of the TV all day be in a poorly maintained building, with rooms that all look the same and have little choice in furnishings need cleaning, with shared bathrooms that aren''t cleaned regularly If you move into a care home When you go into a care home, make sure the management and staff of the home know about your condition, disability and other needs. They may have some of this information already – for example, if the local authority has set up the placement after a care needs assessment. Moving home can be unsettling at the best of times, so when you move into a care home, it''s good to have it planned in advance and have family or friends around you when you move to make you feel more comfortable. You should also: contact the benefits office, if you have one (including disability benefits, as these can be affected by care home stays) make sure other services at your previous address have been notified let friends and family know your know contact details and when you might feel up to receiving visitors Rights of care home residents The Care Quality Commission (CQC) is the regulator of health and adult social care in England, whether it''s provided by the NHS, local authorities, private companies or voluntary organisations. Under existing rules, independent healthcare and adult social services must be registered with the CQC. NHS providers, such as hospitals and ambulance services, must also be registered. The registration of organisations reassures the public when they receive a care service or treatment. It also enables the CQC to check that organisations are continuing to meet CQC standards. Standards for care homes are outlined on the CQC website. These standards are underpinned by regulations governing the quality and safety of services. The regulations are enforceable by law – the CQC can enforce fines, public warnings, or even suspend or close a service if they believe people''s basic rights or safety are at risk. Care home closures Care homes will sometimes close. This can be because the owner decides not to carry on providing the service in that location (for instance, if they retire), or because the home has been sold or failed to meet legal standards. Proposals to close a care home can obviously cause great distress. If the care home is operated by the local authority, it has to follow a consultation process with residents and families. It may be best to get specialist legal advice in this situation. You can find an appropriate solicitor through the Law Society.

Motor neurone disease Julie''s story Media last reviewed: 29/05/2015 Next review due: 29/05/2017 Of the working-age people with disabilities in the UK, almost half are employed – but this figure should be higher. With the right support, many more could join their ranks. If you have a disability, you may be worried that it will limit your job prospects or that you won''t be able to find work. But there''s lots of guidance, support and training to help you into employment. Government-backed schemes can help, while awareness-raising initiatives are challenging the stereotypes about people with disabilities to ensure that everyone has a fair chance of working. The charity Leonard Cheshire Disability runs an internship scheme called Change100, which brings together the UK''s top employers and talented disabled students. Watch videos and read personal stories from three Change100 role models who have benefited from the scheme. Find out more about how Leonard Cheshire Disability supports disabled people looking for work. Know your rights Whatever your physical or learning disability, you have a right to equality, fairness, respect and understanding at your workplace. Employees and jobseekers with disabilities are legally protected against discrimination under the Equality Act 2010. You''re legally entitled to fair treatment when it comes to recruitment, promotion and pay. It also means that employers must make their workplaces accessible to you. It''s now recognised that working has health benefits. The government has pledged to help employers and the medical profession work together to get people with disabilities into work. GOV.UK outlines the help available in looking for work if you''re disabled, which contains advice on looking for work, work schemes, support while you''re in work, and employment rights. Your local job centre can arrange an interview with a disability employment adviser, who is specially trained to help disabled people find suitable jobs. To find your nearest centre, see GOV.UK: Contact Jobcentre Plus. GOV.UK also has details of the "two ticks" scheme for disabled people. Employers who adopt this initiative take a positive approach to disability, and offer interviews to all disabled applicants who meet the minimum job criteria. Look out for the two ticks symbol on websites and job application forms. Government support for disabled working There are two government schemes to help you find suitable work: access to work and work choice. Access to work Access to work is a scheme that provides money towards the cost of equipment or support workers that can help enable you to work. You can find out more by reading the information on GOV.UK about access to work. Work choice Work choice is a scheme that helps people with disabilities who can''t be helped by other work schemes. It can provide you and your employers with support. Find out more on GOV.UK: about work choice. Financial support for disabled workers If you’re ill or disabled, you may be able to apply for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) from the government, which offers you: financial support if you’re unable to work personalised help so that you can work if you’re able to You can apply for ESA if you’re employed, self-employed or unemployed. You might be transferred to ESA if you’ve been claiming other benefits like Income Support or Incapacity Benefit. How much ESA you’ll get How much ESA you get depends on: your circumstances, such as your income the type of ESA you qualify for where you are in the assessment process Find out more from GOV.UK about how much ESA you can get. Universal Credit Universal Credit provides a new single system of means-tested support for working-age people who are in or out of work. Support for housing costs, children, childcare costs, carers, claimants with health conditions and disabilities are integrated in the new benefit. This means that more support will be targeted at people with more severe disabilities. This will be achieved through two elements: the Limited Capability for Work element and, for more severely disabled claimants, the Limited Capability for Work and Work Related Activity element. Entitlement to these elements is based on the outcome of a Work Capability Assessment, aligning with existing arrangements for ESA. The Limited Capability for Work (LCW) Element is £124.86 per month, which is the same level of support provided for disabled adults in the Work Related Activity Component of ESA). The Limited Capability for Work and Work Related Activity Element (LCWRA), the higher rate of additional support for severely disabled adults, is £311.86 per month. (This is significantly more than the support currently provided by the Support Component of ESA). The LCWRA element is at a higher rate than the ESA equivalent to recognise the additional needs of severely disabled claimants. Additionally, disabled people will receive larger work allowances for earned income. The government hopes this will help to encourage people currently out of work to take their first steps into employment, by increasing the incentives to do even a small amount of work. Work Capability Assessment You must go to a Work Capability Assessment while your ESA claim is being assessed. This is to see to what extent your illness or disability affects your ability to work. You’ll then be placed in one of two groups if you’re entitled to ESA: work-related activity group, where you’ll have regular interviews with an adviser support group, where you don’t have interviews How employers can help disabled workers Employers can also find information on GOV.UK about recruiting disabled people and helping disabled employees to stay in work.   If you''re disabled or become disabled while in work, your employer should help you to stay in your job. Changes that your employer should consider – in consultation with you – include: transferring you to another post making changes to your place of work providing a reader or interpreter There may be support for your employer to make these adjustments through Access to Work. You can see examples of how employers helped different employees to stay in work on GOV.UK. Dave Parr is a project worker with Disability Champions at Work, a TUC-backed organisation. He says that stereotypes about people with disabilities can be the biggest barrier between you and getting a job. "The way to stop this is to educate people with meaningful disability awareness training," he says. You can learn more about the recruitment process for people with disabilities from an employer''s point of view and preventing discrimination on GOV.UK. Trade unions can also provide support. Parr says: "In five years, Disability Champions at Work has recruited more than 600 representatives who champion disabled people''s rights in the workplace. "They''ve made a huge difference to the working lives of many people, and raised disability as a trade union issue."

It''s only offered to those thought to be at increased risk of hepatitis B or its complications. The vaccine gives protection against the hepatitis B virus, which is a major cause of serious liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Who should be vaccinated against hepatitis B? You can get infected with hepatitis B if you have contact with an infected person''s blood or other body fluids. Babies born to mothers infected with hepatitis B are also at risk of becoming infected. People at risk of hepatitis B – and who should therefore consider vaccination – are: people who inject drugs or have a partner who injects drugs people who change their sexual partners frequently men who have sex with men babies born to infected mothers close family and sexual partners of someone with hepatitis B anyone who receives regular blood transfusions or blood products people with any form of liver disease people with chronic kidney disease people travelling to high-risk countries male and female sex workers people who work somewhere that places them at risk of contact with blood or body fluids, such as nurses, prison staff, doctors, dentists and laboratory staff prisoners families adopting or fostering children from high-risk countries How to get vaccinated against hepatitis B Ask your GP to vaccinate you, or visit any sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic for the hepatitis B vaccination. Find your local genitourinary medicine clinic. If your job places you at risk of hepatitis B infection, it is your employer''s responsibility to arrange vaccination for you, rather than your GP. Contact your occupational health department. What does hepatitis B immunisation involve? Full protection involves having three injections of hepatitis B vaccine over four to six months. If you''re a healthcare worker or you have kidney failure, you will be followed up to see if you have responded to the vaccine. Anyone vaccinated by their own occupational health service can also request a blood test to see if they have responded to the vaccine. Five-year boosters are recommended for anyone thought to be at continuing risk of infection. Emergency hepatitis B vaccination If you''ve been exposed to the hepatitis B virus and have not been vaccinated before, you should seek medical advice immediately as you may benefit from the hepatitis B vaccine. In some situations, you may also need to have an injection of antibodies called specific hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) along with the hepatitis B vaccine. HBIG should ideally be given within 48 hours, but you can still have it up to a week after exposure. Babies and hepatitis B vaccination Pregnant women have a routine blood test for hepatitis B as part of their antenatal care. Babies born to mothers found to be infected with hepatitis B need to be given a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of their birth, followed by further doses at 1, 2 and 12 months old. Babies of mothers identified by the blood test as particularly infectious might also receive an injection of HBIG at birth on top of the hepatitis B vaccination to give them rapid protection against infection. All babies born to mothers infected with hepatitis B should be tested at 12 months old to check if they have become infected with the virus. Hepatitis B vaccination in pregnancy Hepatitis B infection in pregnant women may result in severe disease for the mother and chronic infection for the baby, so it''s advised that a pregnant woman should have the hepatitis B vaccine if she is in a high-risk category. There is no evidence of any risk from vaccinating pregnant or breastfeeding women against hepatitis B. And since it''s an inactivated (killed) vaccine, the risk to the unborn baby is likely to be negligible. Hepatitis B vaccine on the NHS Hospitals, GP surgeries and sexual health or GUM clinics usually provide the hepatitis B vaccination free of charge for anyone at risk of infection. GPs are not obliged to provide the hepatitis B vaccine on the NHS if you''re not thought to be at risk. GPs may charge for the hepatitis B vaccine if you want it as a travel vaccine, or they may refer you to a travel clinic so you can get vaccinated privately. The current cost of the vaccine (in 2015) is around £40 a dose. How safe is the hepatitis B vaccine? The hepatitis B vaccine is very safe. Other than some redness and soreness at the site of the injection, side effects are rare. It is an inactivated (killed) vaccine, so it cannot cause the disease itself. Read more about vaccine safety and side effects. Page last reviewed: 30/11/2015 Next review due: 30/11/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

(218, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/How-vaccines-work.aspx', NULL, 'How vaccines work - Vaccinations - NHS Choices', '', 'Vaccines work by making us produce antibodies to fight disease without actually infecting us with the disease. If the vaccinated person then comes into contact with the disease itself, their immune system will recognise it and immediately produce the antibodies they need to fight it. Newborn babies are already protected against several diseases, such as measles, mumps and rubella, because antibodies have passed to them from their mothers via the placenta. This is called passive immunity. Passive immunity usually only lasts for a few weeks or months. In the case of measles, mumps and rubella, it may last up to one year, which is why the MMR jab is given to children just after their first birthday. How are vaccines made? The first step is to make the organism that produces the disease, which is called the pathogen. The pathogen is a virus or a bacterium. Viruses and bacteria can be mass-produced in the laboratory by infecting cells grown in tissue culture. The pathogen must then be altered to ensure it doesn''t trigger the disease itself. The treated pathogen is then combined with other vaccine ingredients, such as stabilisers and preservatives, to produce a vaccine dose. Can you overload a child''s immune system? You might be concerned that giving too many vaccines at the same time will "overload" your child''s immune system, especially at one year of age, when four injections are given in a single session.  But this isn''t the case. Studies have shown there are no harmful effects from giving multiple injections or vaccines in one session. As soon as a baby is born they come into contact with a huge number of different bacteria and viruses every day, and their immune system copes with them and becomes stronger as a result. The bacteria and viruses used in vaccines are weakened or killed, and there are far fewer of them than the natural bugs that babies and children come into contact with. Immunisation helps to improve protection against life-threatening diseases at the very earliest opportunity. Watch this short animation to find out more. How long does a vaccination last? Some vaccines provide very high levels of protection – for example, MMR provides 90% protection against measles and rubella after one dose. Others are not as effective – typhoid vaccine, a travel vaccine, provides around 70% protection over three years. How a vaccination programme works When a vaccination programme is introduced, everyone in the population of a certain age or risk group is offered a specific vaccine to try to reduce the number of cases of the disease. Vaccination programmes aim to protect people for life. They often concentrate on young children, as they''re particularly vulnerable to many potentially dangerous infections. Some vaccination programmes are targeted at older people, as with the shingles vaccine, or certain risk groups, as with the hepatitis B vaccine.  When a vaccination programme against a disease begins, the number of people catching the disease goes down. As the threat decreases, it''s important to keep vaccinating, otherwise the disease can start to spread again. If enough people in a community are vaccinated, it''s harder for a disease to pass between people who have not been vaccinated. This is called herd immunity. Herd immunity is particularly important for protecting people who can''t get vaccinated because they''re too ill or because they''re having treatment that damages their immune system. Public Health England (PHE) records the vaccinations that adults and children receive. PHE also records the number of cases of each disease each year. This way, PHE can work out the impact that each vaccination has on a particular disease. This data helps the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) consider whether the routine vaccination programme needs to be changed. Eliminating disease As more of the population is vaccinated, the disease can sometimes disappear completely and the vaccination programme can be stopped, as has happened with smallpox. The more infectious the disease, the greater the number of people who have to be vaccinated to keep the disease under control. Measles, for instance, is highly infectious. If vaccination rates go down, measles will quickly spread again. We know that at least 90% of children have to be immune to stop the disease from spreading. If 95% of children are protected by MMR, it''s possible to eliminate not just measles, but mumps and rubella as well.

Abuse and neglect can occur anywhere: in your own home or a public place, while you are in hospital or attending a day centre, or in a college or care home. You may be living alone or with others. The person causing the harm may be a stranger to you, but more often than not the person is known, and it can be the case that you usually feel safe with them. They are usually in a position of trust and power, such as a health and care professional, relative or neighbour. Different forms of abuse and neglect There are many forms of abuse and neglect, including: Sexual abuse This includes indecent exposure, sexual harassment, inappropriate looking or touching, as well as rape. Sexual teasing or innuendo, sexual photography, subjection to pornography, witnessing sexual acts, and sexual acts that you didn''t agree to or were pressured into consenting to all count as sexual abuse. Physical abuse This can include being assaulted, hit, slapped, pushed, restrained, being denied food or water, or not being helped to go to the bathroom when you need to go. It can also include misuse of your medication. Psychological abuse This includes someone emotionally abusing you or threatening to hurt or abandon you, stopping you from seeing people, and humiliating, blaming, controlling, intimidating or harassing you. It also includes verbal abuse, cyber bullying and isolation, or an unreasonable and unjustified withdrawal of services or support networks. Domestic abuse This is typically an incident or pattern of incidents of controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour, violence or abuse by someone who is, or has been, an intimate partner or family member. Discriminatory abuse This includes some forms of harassment, slurs or similar unfair treatment relating to race, gender and gender identity, age, disability, sexual orientation, or religion. Financial abuse This could be someone stealing money or other valuables from you, or it might be someone who is appointed to look after your money on your behalf using the money inappropriately or coercing you into spending it in a way you are not happy with. Internet scams and doorstep crime are also common forms of financial abuse.  Neglect Neglect is also a form of abuse. Neglect includes not being provided with enough food or the right kind of food, or not being taken proper care of. Leaving you without help to wash or change dirty or wet clothes, not getting you to a doctor when you need one, or not making sure you have the right medicines all count as neglect. Abuse in your home You''re more at risk of abuse at home if: you are isolated and don''t have much contact with friends, family or neighbours you have memory problems or have difficulty communicating you become dependent on someone as a carer you don''t get on with your main carer your carer is addicted to drugs or alcohol your carer relies on you for a home, or financial and emotional support Find out more about abuse, domestic violence and sexual assault. I think I am being abused or neglected: what can I do? Who to talk to if you feel you are being abused or neglected: Don''t worry about making a fuss – tell someone you trust as soon as possible. Speak to friends or careworkers, who may have an understanding of the situation and be able to take steps quickly to improve the situation.  You can also talk to professionals such as your GP or social worker about your concerns, or you could ask to speak to your local council''s Adult Safeguarding team or co-ordinator. Call Action on Elder Abuse 0808 808 8141 for advice. If you believe a crime is being, or has been, committed – whether it''s physical abuse or financial – talk to the police or ask someone you trust to do so on your behalf. Spotting signs of elder abuse: advice for carers It''s not always easy to spot the symptoms of abuse. Someone being abused may make excuses for why they''re bruised, they don''t want to go out or talk to people, or they''re short of money. It''s important to know the signs of abuse and, where they are identified, gently share your concerns with the person being abused. If you wait, hoping the person will tell you what''s been happening to them, you could delay matters and allow the abuse to continue.  Behavioural signs of abuse in an older person include them: becoming quiet and withdrawn  being aggressive or angry for no obvious reason  looking unkempt, dirty or thinner than usual  sudden changes in their normal character, such as appearing helpless, depressed or tearful physical signs of abuse, such as bruises, wounds, fractures and other untreated injuries  the same injuries happening more than once  not wanting to be left on their own or alone with particular people  being unusually lighthearted and insisting there''s nothing wrong Additionally, their home may lack heat, be unusually dirty or untidy, or you might notice things missing. Other signs to watch out for include a sudden change in their finances, not having as much money as usual to pay for shopping or regular outings, or getting into debt. Watch out for any official or financial documents that seem unusual, and for documents relating to their finances that suddenly go missing. If you feel someone you know is showing signs of abuse, talk to them to see if there''s anything you can do to help. If they''re being abused, they may not want to talk about it straight away, especially if they''ve become used to making excuses for their injuries or change in personality. Don''t ignore your concerns, though. That could allow any abuse to carry on or escalate. I''m worried about someone who may be experiencing abuse or neglect. What should I do? Start by talking to the person in private if you feel able to do so. Mention some of the things that concern you – for instance, that they''ve become depressed and withdrawn, have been losing weight, or seem to be short of money. Let them talk as much as they want to, but be mindful that if they''ve been abused, they may be reluctant to talk about it because they''re afraid of making the situation worse, because they don''t want to cause trouble or they might be experiencing coercion by someone or being threatened in some way. It''s best not to promise the person you won''t tell anyone what you''ve heard. If an adult is being abused or neglected, it''s important to find help for them and stop the harm. Stay calm while the person is talking, even if you''re upset by what you hear, otherwise they may become more upset themselves and stop telling you what''s been going on. It can be very difficult for an abused or neglected person to talk about what''s been happening to them. Unless you''re concerned for their immediate health and safety and feel it''s vital to act straight away, give them time to think about what they''d like to do. If you''re right and the person has been abused or neglected, ask them what they''d like you to do. Let them know who can help them. Say you can seek some help on their behalf if they want or if it''s difficult for them to do so themselves. It''s important to listen to what they say and not to charge into action if this isn''t what they want. Who to contact about elder abuse If an adult has told you about their situation, you might want to talk to other people who know the person you''re worried about to find out if they have similar concerns. There are also professionals you can contact. You can pass on your concerns to the person''s GP and social worker. Local authorities have social workers who deal specifically with cases of abuse and neglect. Call the person''s local council and ask for the adult safeguarding co-ordinator. You can also speak to the police about the situation. Some forms of abuse are crimes, so the police will be interested. If the person is in danger or needs medical attention, call their GP if known or emergency services if immediate assistance is required. You can also call the Action on Elder Abuse helpline, free and in confidence, on 0808 808 8141.

Home improvement agencies You may be able to get help to repair, improve, maintain or adapt your home from a local home improvement agency. These agencies are government-funded and not-for-profit, and they provide advice for free. However, they usually charge a fee if you go ahead with any work they recommend. You can find your nearest home improvement agency on the Foundations website. If you''re disabled, you can find out whether you can apply for equipment for your home on GOV.UK.  Choosing a wheelchair or scooter If you need a wheelchair, the main decisions you’ll have to make about your chair are: whether it will be self-propelled, pushed by someone else, or electric-powered for permanent or occasional use  for indoor or outdoor use  whether you need it to go in and out of a car There are pros and cons for each type of chair, so the choice depends on your needs. There are a large variety of wheelchairs and scooters available, so expert independent advice is essential. Some of the things to consider when choosing the right equipment are: Your physical ability. For example, if you’re unable to stand up, a scooter may be difficult to manage. Stability and balance may also affect what you can use. How the equipment will be used. For example, do you need to get up stairs or through narrow doorways? Practical considerations, such as access to a power point if the equipment needs to be charged up, or having a secure place to store the equipment when it''s not in use.   Choice of wheelchair design The design of the chair affects how it can be used. Look out for: large rear wheels, which make wheelchairs easier to manoeuvre  wheels positioned further forward on an adjustable axle, which require less effort to move the chair lightweight chairs that fold or can be dismantled easily if the wheelchair has to be lifted and transported regularly seat size, angle and style, as well as the position of the foot, back and arm rests – these should all be taken into account when considering the comfort of the chair You should also bear in mind that standard wheelchairs can''t be modified. "Active-user" wheelchairs are usually more expensive, but they have the advantage of being adjustable and adaptable. If you need a wheelchair that’s pushed by someone else, it''s still important to consider how easy it will be for them to use it. For example, can they lift it and put it in the boot of the car? Before deciding on a specific style of wheelchair, it''s a good idea to try it out around the house or on the local roads. How to get a wheelchair NHS wheelchair services NHS wheelchair services offer assessments to determine what type of wheelchair or mobility equipment you may be entitled to on the NHS. In most cases, you''ll be referred to the service by a hospital, doctor, consultant or occupational therapists. See the directory of wheelchair services for a full list of services. In general, wheelchair services are available to people of all ages who have a long-term need for mobility help. However, the specific criteria for whether you''re eligible are decided locally and will vary depending on where you live. Before you can be offered a wheelchair, you''ll have to undergo an assessment. This will determine if you''re eligible and, if so, what type of mobility equipment is most appropriate. The assessment is normally carried out at NHS wheelchair services centres or clinics. The people who assess you will all be health professionals, such as GPs, occupational therapists, or physiotherapists, and should include a "rehabilitation engineer" (someone who specialises in wheelchairs and seating). There is no one-size-fits-all policy, which means you will be assessed according to your individual needs. The assessment should take into account your physical and social needs, as well as the environment in which you live and work. Many wheelchair services have a waiting list for assessment appointments, so you may have to wait several weeks after being referred to have an assessment. Take a friend, carer or your own therapist with you when you have your assessment. They can help you make the right choice. Also bear in mind that if the service comes to visit you at home or work, you won''t be able to see and try the full range of chairs available. Chairs can be adapted if necessary to meet your specific needs. This is particularly important for children, as their equipment must adjust to their growth and changing needs. If you feel that your wheelchair doesn''t fit your current needs any more, contact your wheelchair service and they will reassess you. NHS voucher scheme Some NHS wheelchair services offer a voucher scheme so that you can have more choice of wheelchair. You receive a voucher to the value of the chair you would have been offered after your assessment (which is determined locally in each individual case). You can then put the voucher towards the cost of a chair that you buy privately or in partnership with the NHS. If the maintenance of the wheelchair remains the responsibility of the NHS, you will have to return the chair when you no longer need it. However, you can opt for private maintenance, which will allow you to keep the chair permanently. Not all NHS wheelchair services offer the voucher scheme. Services decide locally whether to have a scheme and how that scheme is applied. You cannot exchange the voucher for cash. The voucher is non-taxable so it does not affect any disability benefits you receive.  Motability The Motability scheme may be of use if you want to hire or buy a powered wheelchair. It is available to people who receive the high rate mobility component of Disability Living Allowance or the War Pensioners'' Mobility Supplement. These benefits can be used to pay for the hire or hire purchase of a wheelchair or scooter. Renting or buying equipment privately You can rent or buy equipment from some commercial companies, but it''s important to take independent advice to ensure you make the best choice. The consumer website Which? Elderly Care has lots of advice on choosing and buying mobility products, as does Living Made Easy. Better Mobility has a list of charities that can help to fund mobility equipment for children and adults on its website. Do some research before you choose a wheelchair or scooter. Ensure the chair suits your individual needs, can be maintained, and is a reasonable price. The following 10-point checklist may help: Try as many makes and types of wheelchairs or scooters as possible (you may have to visit several suppliers to see different ranges). Ask if you can try the chair at home. This will allow you to check whether the size of the chair is suitable for your home. Also try the chair outside on a regular route. Check it goes in your car boot and that it works anywhere else you might use it.   Find out how long the delivery time is, and ask if it will be delivered ready for use. Check whether it''s guaranteed and for how long. Check if insurance is available and if it requires you to maintain the wheelchair according to the manufacturer''s guidance. Ask if the retailer keeps spare parts in stock or if they need to order them. If so, how long would you have to wait? Check if the retailer does repairs or if this is provided by a third party. Ask if they do home visits or take the chair or scooter away for repair. Check whether the chair or scooter will be collected and delivered for repairs, and whether you will get a free replacement chair or scooter. Find out what other people think about a particular wheelchair or scooter. Online forums may help here. Shopmobility schemes Some towns or shopping centres have a Shopmobility scheme, where you can borrow a wheelchair or scooter to go shopping. Local authority wheelchair schemes Local authorities provide wheelchairs as part of their duty to help disabled children access education. Contact your local authority for more information. Children''s wheelchair needs are different from those of adults. They need smaller chairs that can be adapted as they grow. If your child has been assessed as needing a wheelchair, you may want to contact a charity such as Whizz Kidz or Go Kids Go!. These provide wheelchair skills training for disabled young people. As well as providing children with wheelchairs, local authorities are responsible for carrying out home adaptations if you need them to use a wheelchair at home. Your local authority is also responsible for issuing static seating (which might include chairs that offer more stability and support) and night time posture support (which might include special mattresses or bed accessories) if required. Contact your local authority for more information about what''s available for you. Access to Work scheme The Access to Work scheme can help you if your health or disability affects the way you do your job. It gives you and your employer advice about and support with extra costs that may arise because of your needs. Find out more about the Access to Work scheme. Short-term loan wheelchairs If you need a wheelchair for a short period, such as after an accident or when you''ve been discharged from hospital, you may be able to apply for a short-term loan wheelchair with your local wheelchair service. For more detailed information, contact your local wheelchair service. The wheelchair service will not provide a wheelchair if it is only required for day trips or outings. Further independent advice on mobility equipment The Disabled Living Foundation''s AskSara online tool can give you information and advice on mobility equipment, including stair rails and activity monitoring systems as well as wheelchair and scooter accessories. You can get information on mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs as well as information on accessible transport from Rica, an independent consumer research charity for older and disabled people.

However, vaccination will help protect them against a range of serious and potentially fatal diseases. There are three good reasons to have your child vaccinated: vaccinations are quick, safe and extremely effective once your child has been vaccinated against a disease, their body can fight it off better if a child isn''t vaccinated, they''re at higher risk of catching – and becoming very ill from – the illness There will always be some children who are unavoidably unprotected because: they can''t be vaccinated for medical reasons they''re too young to be vaccinated they can''t get to the vaccine clinics the vaccine doesn''t work (although this is rare) However, if more parents have their children vaccinated, then more children in the community will be protected against an illness. This lowers the chance of a measles outbreak. Can you overload a child''s immune system? You may be concerned that too many vaccines at a young age could "overload" your child''s immune system, but this really isn''t the case. Studies have shown that vaccines don''t weaken a child''s immune system. As soon as a baby is born, they come into contact with a huge number of different bacteria and viruses every day, and their immune system copes well. The bacteria and viruses used in vaccines are weakened or killed, and there are far fewer of them than the natural bugs that babies and children come into contact with. In fact, if a child was given 11 vaccines all at the same time, it would only use a thousandth of their immune system! Watch this short animation to find out more.

You and your family may worry about how long you can care for yourself, particularly if you live alone. People with dementia can remain independent for some time, but will need support from family and friends. Living at home when you have dementia In the early stages of dementia, many people are able to look after their homes in the same way as before their diagnosis. However, as the illness gets worse, it is likely that someone who has dementia will find it difficult to look after their home and they may need help with daily activities, such as housework and shopping. The home of a person with dementia may also need to be adapted to enable them to stay safe, mobile and independent. Living alone with dementia It’s good to stay independent for as long as possible. Many people with dementia continue to live successfully on their own for some time. However, be aware that, as your condition progresses, you will need extra support to help you cope, and it’s better to get this in place early.

Because the MMR vaccine combines three separate vaccines in one injection, each vaccine can cause different side effects that can happen at different times. There''s less chance of side effects after the second dose of MMR than the first. Common side effects of the MMR vaccine About a week to 11 days after the MMR injection, some children get a very mild form of measles. This includes a rash, high temperature, loss of appetite and a general feeling of being unwell for about two or three days. Find out how to treat a high temperature in a child. About three to four weeks after having the MMR injection, one in 50 children develop a mild form of mumps. This includes swelling of the glands in the cheek, neck or under the jaw, and lasts for a day or two. One to three weeks after receiving the rubella vaccine component of MMR vaccine, some adult women experience painful, stiff or swollen joints, which can last for around three days. Rare side effects of the MMR vaccine Bruise-like spots In rare cases, a child may get a small rash of bruise-like spots about two weeks after having the MMR vaccine. This side effect is linked to the rubella vaccine and is known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). It''s been estimated that ITP develops in one in every 24,000 doses of the MMR vaccine given. There is a greater risk of developing ITP from measles or rubella infection than there is from having the vaccine. ITP usually gets better without treatment but, as with any rash, you should seek advice from your GP as soon as possible. Seizures (fits) There is a small chance of having a seizure (fit) six to 11 days after having the MMR vaccine. It sounds alarming, but it''s rare, and only happens in only about one in every 1,000 doses. In fact, MMR-related seizures are less frequent than seizures that occur as a direct result of a measles infection. Allergic reaction to the MMR vaccine In extremely rare cases, a child can have a severe allergic reaction (known medically as anaphylaxis) immediately after having the MMR vaccine. It''s an alarming prospect, but if the child is treated quickly, they make a full recovery. Medical staff who give vaccines are trained to deal with allergic reactions. This NHS leaflet tells you about the common side effects of vaccinations that may occur in babies and children under five.

But for many services, the local authority may carry out a financial assessment to see if you should pay for, or contribute to, the cost of your care services. Local authorities are not required to charge for care services, but they must abide by legal guidance if they do. If your local authority will pay for some or all of your care, you will be given a personal budget, and it could: provide the care directly to you, either through its own staff or through an organisation it has contracted to do so give you direct payments that enable you to buy the services directly with money given to you by the local authority For more information, see Choosing care. Services local authorities must provide free of charge There are some items the local authority must provide for free if you are assessed as needing them. These are: community equipment  minor adaptations to your home  reablement  Community equipment "Community equipment" means items specifically designed to make daily life easier for you. For example: equipment to help with zips or buttons telephones with large buttons or flashing lights communication aids telecare equipment The need for this type of equipment will come out of an assessment of your needs. However, your local authority may claim the equipment you need could be used by anyone. For example, an electric tin opener might be helpful, but your local authority may regard it as "ordinary equipment" that it will not fund. You could argue it would be reasonable and sensible to provide equipment that will help with assessed needs. A local authority may have set rules about the type of equipment it will consider supplying, or the level of costs it will meet. If this is the case, you could argue they shouldn''t have blanket policies about the equipment they will provide and should make decisions depending on individual circumstances. If you disagree with a decision about community equipment, use the local authority''s complaints procedure. Minor adaptations Minor adaptations costing less than £1,000 are provided by local authorities at no charge. Minor adaptations include: grab rails to make it safer to get in and out of a bath blocks to make beds higher raised toilet seats and bath seats In some cases you may be asked to pay associated costs, such as maintenance charges. If you disagree with the decision about a minor adaptation, use the complaints procedure. If the adaptation will cost more than £1,000, you may be eligible for a disabled facilities grant. Reablement Reablement services are meant to help people adapt to a recent illness or disability by learning or relearning the skills necessary for independent daily living at home. Reablement services may be offered to someone who has recently come out of hospital. It can include: helping you practise daily activities such as cooking and bathing to help you regain skills and get your confidence back helping you find new ways to do some things so you feel safer and more confident looking at what else might help, such as whether you need support to go out, or whether you could benefit from a personal alarm or telecare involving your relatives or carers in helping you live more independently, and discussing any support they might need Reablement should be provided free of charge by the local authority for up to six weeks. In some cases the support may be expected to last longer than six weeks – for instance, if someone has recently become sight impaired – and the local authority should consider the benefits of this, including the reduced risk of hospital readmissions. Financial assessment for care and support services If you have been assessed as needing care services, your local authority will carry out a financial assessment (a means test) to see if you should pay something towards the cost of your care. This assessment looks at your income, including tax credits and some benefits after disability-related expenses (if it is including disability benefits). Disability-related expenditure can include items such as laundry, maintenance, respite care, and extra bedding. If you need to go into a care home, the local authority must ensure you have enough money to spend on any personal items you might need, such as clothes and toiletries. This is known as a personal expenses allowance (PEA). A local authority has the discretion to allow a larger personal expenses allowance – for example, if you have dependent children, or you are a temporary resident and also need to meet the costs of your own property. If you''d experience hardship if the allowance was not increased, you should complain about this to the local authority. If you are receiving care in your own home, the local authority must ensure you have enough money left after charges to meet your living costs, such as rent and food. This is known as the minimum income guarantee (MIG). The levels are the equivalent of Income Support plus 25%, and the amounts are set out in regulations. Capital, deprivation of capital and notional capital The local authority will also look at your capital, such as savings and property. Currently, local authorities won''t contribute to the cost of your care if you have more than £23,250 in savings and property (known as "capital"). From April 2020, this threshold will rise alongside the introduction of the cap on care costs, so more people will be eligible for help sooner. Support is means-tested, which means the local authority will carry out a financial assessment to work out what you can afford to contribute towards the cost of your care. If you have more than this capital limit because of the value of your home, but you have a low income, the local authority may allow you to defer payment while you arrange to sell your home. If the local authority thinks someone has deliberately got rid of capital to get financial assistance, it will treat that person as if they still had that capital. This could apply if you: spent money on a non-essential or luxury item gave money away gave away property or a share of property The local authority will look at the reason why the money has been spent. Repaying a debt, for example, may justify your action, but it will depend on the individual circumstances. The timing of the expenditure or disposal of capital is also important. If you didn''t know you needed care or you were likely to need care in the immediate future, the less likely it is that the local authority will view it as deliberate deprivation of capital. If the local authority decides there has been deliberate deprivation of capital, you will be treated as if you still had the capital. This is known as notional capital. Notional capital is treated as gradually reducing over time to a point where you qualify for full help. You can use the local authority complaints system to dispute a decision. If you disagree with the local authority''s assessment of your needs or your finances, you can take steps to challenge the decision. Contact your local authority to discuss how to do this. If the situation is complicated – for example, around deprivation of capital – it may be best to get specialist legal advice. Top-ups and choice of services If you are receiving local authority support with the cost of your care and you need to live in a certain place to receive that care, such as a care home, you have the right to choose where you live (choice of accommodation). The local authority must ensure you have at least one choice that is affordable from the amount identified in your personal budget, and ideally more than one. Some local authorities will have a list of preferred providers that they will usually recommend. If you do not like the provider suggested, or you or the person you care for has a particular service in mind, you can ask the local authority to arrange it. The local authority has a duty to explain this right of choice to you. This free choice is subject to conditions: the preferred accommodation must be available the preferred accommodation must be suitable to meet your assessed needs it will not cost more than the amount set out in your personal budget the provider is willing to enter into a contract You may choose a care home that is more expensive than the amount set out in your personal budget. If you do, a third party such as a relative or friend must be willing and able to pay the difference in cost for the likely duration of your stay. This is known as a top-up payment. Where a person agrees to enter into a top-up payment, they will need to sign a written agreement with the local authority. This will set out what the costs are, how often they have to be paid, and what will happen if the person is no longer able to make the payment. In some limited circumstances you can make this payment. This is if you enter into a deferred payment scheme, or you benefit from the value of your property being disregarded for the first 12 weeks of your care. The restrictions on paying this additional cost yourself will be lifted from April 2020, when the point at which means-tested support for care costs is increased. The local authority can never require you to pay a top-up payment and must ensure there is at least one choice available within the amount set in your personal budget. Any arrangements to pay a top-up must involve your local authority, and should not be directly between you and your provider.

(229, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/attendance-allowance.aspx', 'Attendance Allowance', 'Attendance Allowance - Care and support guide - NHS Choices', '', 'Attendance Allowance is a benefit for severely disabled people aged 65 or over who need help with personal care. People aged under 65 who have care needs should claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP). Attendance Allowance is not means-tested and it''s tax-free. Attendance Allowance is awarded as either as an ongoing benefit or for a fixed period, determined by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Attendance Allowance claims To claim Attendance Allowance, you must be aged 65 or over and be present in Great Britain and resident in the United Kingdom. (Exceptions to this rule can include members of the Armed Forces and people living in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland.) You must also normally have had care needs for six months (although you can make a claim earlier). To qualify for Attendance Allowance, the person claiming it must have a physical or mental disability that is severe enough for them to: need attention, including help with things such as washing, dressing or eating; help with communication; encouragement and prompting to do something or look after themselves; or help with reading if the person has a visual impairment need supervision to avoid them putting themselves or others in substantial danger need someone with them, such as when they''re on regular dialysis Examples of the kinds of difficulties that may allow someone to qualify for Attendance Allowance (this is not an exhaustive list): difficulty getting in or out of bed without help difficulty getting dressed or undressed (it presents problems or takes a long time) needing physical help or supervision with activities such as having a bath, showering, brushing teeth and shaving difficulty moving around indoors, getting in and out of chairs, or getting to and from the toilet being forgetful and needing reminders for things such as taking medication or turning off the gas not realising when a condition is getting worse getting dizzy, stumbling or falling needing encouragement to eat, wash or sleep properly needing help at night to take medication, go to the toilet, or needing someone to help soothe them back to sleep Many people will have difficulties other than those listed above. Keeping a diary for a week can help identify what difficulties someone has, how often these difficulties arise, what help is needed, and for how long. There are two rates of Attendance Allowance, depending on the amount of help needed. A person can get Attendance Allowance for their care needs even if they live alone or nobody is actually giving them the care they need. Lower rate Attendance Allowance To get the lower rate Attendance Allowance, you must need: attention frequently throughout the day supervision continually (for most of the day) prolonged or repeated attention during the night, or someone needs to watch over you at night someone to be with you while on dialysis twice or more a week Higher rate Attendance Allowance To get the higher rate of Attendance Allowance, the claimant must have a physical or mental disability that is severe enough for them to need supervision to avoid them putting themselves or others in substantial danger. It can also be paid if the person claiming Attendance Allowance is terminally ill. Attendance Allowance and terminal illness Someone who is terminally ill can make a claim for Attendance Allowance under special rules. Claiming under these special rules ensures that the claim is dealt with quickly, normally within eight working days. The law on Attendance Allowance says that someone is regarded as terminally ill if they have a progressive disease and their death from that disease is reasonably expected within six months. Although there must be a reasonable expectation that death will occur within six months, Attendance Allowance will normally continue to be paid for three years under the special rules. At the end of this time, the claimant may be asked for further information about their health and how it affects them, so that their entitlement can be reassessed. If the claim is accepted under the special rules, the claimant will automatically qualify for the higher rate of Attendance Allowance. The claimant doesn''t need to complete a qualifying period to be entitled to the benefit. Making a claim under the special rules for terminally ill people If you are making a claim under the special rules, it''s a good idea to discuss it with your GP or consultant. They will need to complete a DS1500 form, which asks for information about your diagnosis and treatment. The DS1500 form should be sent to the DWP with an Attendance Allowance claim form. You can get a claim form: at any Jobcentre Plus office by ringing the Attendance Allowance helpline on 0345 605 6055 (textphone 0345 604 5312) online Making a claim on behalf of someone else A claim can also be made on another person’s behalf by a carer, family member, friend or professional person. The person who is terminally ill doesn''t have to sign the claim form. They will simply be notified that they have been awarded the benefit and payment will be made to them. The official source of government information on benefits is GOV.UK. Page last reviewed: 15/01/2015 Next review due: 15/01/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Many babies have no side effects at all, and in those that do, any side effects tend to be mild and short-lived. Common side effects of the Men B vaccine The most common side effect seen with the Men B vaccine when it''s given alongside other vaccinations is a fever, or high temperature, so it''s important to use paracetamol following vaccination to reduce the risk of fever. In studies when the Men B was given to babies without paracetamol more than half of them developed fever. The fever peaks around six hours after vaccination but is nearly always gone within two days The fever shows that your baby is responding to the vaccine, although not getting a fever doesn’t mean it hasn’t worked. Other common side effects of the Men B vaccine include: pain, swelling or redness at the injection site vomiting and/or diarrhoea crying and irritability Men B vaccine and paracetamol It''s recommended that you give your baby liquid paracetamol to reduce the risk of fever after vaccination.  Giving paracetamol reduces the chances of your baby getting fever by more than a half, and nearly all these fevers are mild. Your nurse will give you more information about paracetamol at your vaccination appointment. You''ll also be given a leaflet for parents about paracetamol which includes instructions on what dose to give your baby. It’s a good idea to have some liquid paracetamol at home before the two-month vaccination visit. You can buy it from your local pharmacy or supermarket. Premature babies, Men B vaccine and paracetamol If your baby was born before 32 weeks, they should have paracetamol prescribed for them according to their weight rather than being supplied with a sachet of infant paracetamol by the surgery or having liquid paracetamol that you''ve bought from a pharmacist. Read this NHS leaflet to find out how to use paracetamol to prevent and treat fever after Men B vaccination. Rare side effects of the Men B vaccine Allergic reaction: In rare cases, babies can have an allergic reaction to the Men B vaccine soon after the injection. This may take the form of a rash or itching that affects part or all of their body. In very rare cases, they may have an anaphylactic reaction – a severe allergic reaction – within a few minutes of the vaccination. This can cause breathing difficulties and a person to collapse. It''s very alarming at the time, but the doctor or nurse giving the vaccine will have been trained in how to treat these reactions and, providing they receive treatment promptly, babies make a complete recovery. You can read more about the side effects of the Men B vaccine in the patient information leaflet for Bexsero. What to do if your baby is unwell after the Men B vaccine As with all vaccines, a few babies will have side effects, such as looking red or flushed, crying, feeling a bit irritable and so on, though in general these are mild and short-lived. The vast majority of babies won’t have any problems at all. Follow the advice of your nurse on how to use liquid paracetamol to prevent fever after vaccination. If your baby is unwell at any time after vaccination, or if you''re concerned about their health, then trust your instincts and speak to your doctor or call NHS 111. Never give medicines that contain aspirin to a baby. How to tell if your baby has a fever. How to take your baby''s temperature. Get practical tips on how to cool down a baby with a fever. Monitoring the safety of the Men B vaccine In the UK, the safety of vaccines is monitored through the Yellow Card Scheme by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the Committee on Safety of Medicines. Levels of disease and vaccine uptake are recorded by the Health Protection Agency, to measure the impact of vaccines on disease. Most reactions to vaccines reported through the Yellow Card Scheme have been minor, such as rashes, fever, vomiting, and redness and swelling where the injection was given.

Antibodies are proteins that recognise and fight off germs, such as viruses, that have invaded your blood. If you''re exposed to the flu virus after you''ve had the flu vaccine, your immune system will recognise the virus and immediately produce antibodies to fight it. It may take 10 to 14 days for your immunity to build up fully after you have had the flu shot. You need to have a flu jab every year, as the antibodies that protect you from flu decline over time, and flu strains can also change from year to year. Read more about how vaccines work. How the annual flu jab changes In February each year, the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the strains of flu virus that are most likely to be circulating in the northern hemisphere over the following winter. Based on this assessment, WHO recommends which three flu strains the vaccines should contain for the forthcoming winter. Vaccine manufacturers then produce flu vaccines based on WHO''s recommendations. These flu jabs are used in all the countries in the northern hemisphere, not just the UK. Production of the vaccine starts in March each year after WHO''s announcement. The vaccine is usually available in the UK from September. Read about the 2016/17 injected flu vaccine ingredients. Types of flu virus There are three types of flu viruses. They are: type A flu virus – this is usually the more serious type. The virus is most likely to mutate into a new version that people are not resistant to. The H1N1 (swine flu) strain is a type A virus, and flu pandemics in the past were type A viruses. type B flu virus – this generally causes a less severe illness and is responsible for smaller outbreaks. It mainly affects young children. type C flu virus – this usually causes a mild illness similar to the common cold. Most years, one or two strains of type A flu circulate as well as type B. Deactivated viruses The injectable flu vaccine contains three different types of flu virus (usually two A types and one B type). For most flu vaccines, the three strains of the viruses are grown in hens'' eggs. The viruses are then killed (deactivated) and purified before being made into the vaccine. Because the injected flu vaccine is a killed vaccine, it cannot cause flu. Read 10 myths about flu and the flu vaccine.

Accessing care and support: planning ahead - Roch and Deirdre''s story Media last reviewed: 12/05/2016 Next review due: 12/05/2018 There may be times in your life when you think about the consequences of becoming seriously ill or disabled. This may be at a time of ill health or as a result of a life-changing event. It may simply be because you are the sort of person who likes to plan ahead. You may want to take the opportunity to think about what living with a serious illness might mean to you, your partner or your relatives, particularly if you become unable to make decisions for yourself. You may wish to record what your preferences and wishes for future care and treatment might be. The costs of long-term care Care has never been free and everyone should think about the care they might need in the future. The long-term costs of care can be significant, and while none of us like to think that we will become old, ill or disabled, it does happen. Likewise, if you’re the parent of a disabled child, planning their future care and how it will be funded is vital. Just like your pension, it is never too early to start thinking and planning your care and support needs and their costs. Even if you’re generally fit and healthy and of working age, don’t ignore your future care. If you’re making long-term financial arrangements, you may want to take into account the potential costs of your future care needs. The Care Act 2014 creates new provisions that will come into force from April 2020. It will introduce a "cap on care costs" that, for the first time ever, will offer you protection from the risk of losing everything you have to meet your care costs. It does this by setting a maximum amount that you will have to pay towards your eligible care needs. This amount will be set nationally, but if you are eligible for local authority support to meet your costs, you will pay much less. Once you reach the cap, your local authority will take over meeting the cost. However, this only applies directly to care services you are eligible for, and you will still have to pay other costs such as a contribution towards your accommodation. If you turn 18 with an eligible care and support need, your cap will be set at zero. Alongside this, the point at which you may be eligible for financial help from your local authority with your care costs is being extended. Currently, if you have more than £23,250 in assets, such as your home or savings, you will need to meet the full cost of your care. From April 2020 this will increase so that more people benefit from financial help. Read more on the changes announced in the Care Act 2014, which came into effect in April 2015. How your local authority can help with planning your care The Care Act 2014 makes clear that local authorities must provide or arrange services that help to prevent people developing care and support needs, or delay people deteriorating to the point where they would need ongoing care and support. Even if you don’t want or need financial assistance with your care, your local authority can still help you plan your care, so it is worth contacting the adult social services of your local council to find out the options available to you and your family. Local authorities must work with people in their areas to provide or arrange services that help to keep people well and independent. This should include identifying the local support and resources already available, and helping people to access them. They should make clear: what types of care and support are available – such as specialised dementia care, befriending services, reablement (short-term care time, for example, to get someone safe, happy and able to live independently in their home after they have been discharged from hospital), personal assistance and residential care the range of care and support services available to local people – in other words, what local providers offer certain types of services what process local people need to use to get care and support that is available where local people can find independent financial advice about care and support and help them to access it how people can raise concerns about the safety or wellbeing of someone who has care and support needs If you think you need care now, or in the very near future, the best way to plan your care and find out about your care needs is to ask your local authority for an assessment. The sooner you ask for an assessment, the sooner that plans for your care can be made. These plans should include what should be done in the event of an emergency. Financial planning for future care needs Local authorities have to help people get independent financial advice, to enable planning and preparation for future care costs. This encompasses a range of services from generic sources of information and advice, such as websites or helplines, to tailored advice relating to specific financial products, which can only be provided by a regulated financial advisor. Some of these services may charge a fee. The Money Advice Service website has tips on planning ahead for a time when you can’t manage your own finances. Making decisions about your future care needs and wishes If you are a young person with disabilities and you have long-term care needs, you should make plans that will help you make arrangements for expected future changes in your life. For example, this could be help with transport so that you can get a job or stay in your current employment. Find out about transitioning from child to adult care and support. If you are nearing retirement age, it’s important that you take account of your likely care needs and plan accordingly. You may wish to consider setting up a Power of Attorney or an advanced decision (living will). These will help people to take account of your preferences if you lose the capacity to make decisions. You will also want to ensure that you have thought about how you might pay for the care you need. Many of us will put off planning for care and support arrangements until the last possible moment. Having an urgent need for care and support after a crisis may mean that we and our families feel pressured into making decisions quickly. Under such pressure, asking the right questions, thinking and planning for your future needs – including options for meeting the cost of care – are vital. It is important that you seek good advice on these subjects so that you can consider your best short-term and long-term options. There are several factors to consider when planning social care. These include: the type of condition you have, and the best ways for you to stay healthy and independent  the type of care you would prefer, and whether it would meet your needs where you would like to be cared for – in your own home, in a residential care setting such as a care home, or in the community while you are living at home  how much your care is likely to cost and whether you may be entitled to free care or financial help who you want to care for you, and whether, if you want friends or family to be your carers, they are able and willing to do so You will need to weigh up the pros and cons of each care option against these factors. For more information read, How do I choose social care? One of the common decisions people are faced with is whether they should sell their home to pay for their care. If you are thinking about moving into a residential care home and are worried about meeting the costs, ask your council for information about a "deferred payment agreement". This is an arrangement whereby the person agrees, with their local authority, to pay some of their care fees at a later date. This means they should not be forced to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for their care. A person or their estate usually repays the local authority from the sale of their property at a later date. The Care Act introduces rules that mean councils have to offer deferred payments to people. Independent advice on planning your care If you are making plans for your future care – at whatever stage – it is worth getting advice. You may want to get specific care advice from a charity, general advice from Citizens Advice or specialist legal, financial or welfare rights advice. Find out about planning future care on the Find Me Good Care website. If you have difficulty communicating or exerting your rights, you may want to have an advocate to deal with these issues on your behalf. Your local authority social services department should have information about organisations in your area that help people who have social care needs. They may offer an advocacy service. If you have a specific condition, you may want to get in touch with a national organisation that supports people with this condition. Your GP surgery should have information on the relevant groups and organisations. Page last reviewed: 29/07/2015 Next review due: 29/07/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Carers'' support groups Media last reviewed: 24/05/2016 Next review due: 24/05/2019 If you have dementia, or you are looking after someone who has dementia, you are likely to face many practical issues in your daily life. People with dementia can feel vulnerable as their condition progresses and they increasingly rely on other people to do things for them. It is important that people who have dementia feel reassured and supported, while retaining some level of independence.  For more information, read staying independent with dementia. Although some symptoms are common to many people with dementia, each person''s experience of the disease and how they cope with it will be different. Helping someone with dementia with everyday tasks When a person with dementia finds that their mental abilities are declining, they''re likely to feel anxious, stressed and scared. They may be aware of their increasing clumsiness and inability to remember things, and this can be very frustrating and upsetting for them. If you are looking after someone with dementia, you can help them feel more secure by creating a regular daily routine in a relaxed environment, where they''re encouraged and not criticised. Involving the person you look after in everyday tasks may make them feel useful and improve their sense of self-worth. They could help with the shopping, laying the table or sweeping leaves in the garden, for example. As the illness progresses, these tasks may become harder for them to manage independently, and you may need to give them more support. How you can help The main way you can help someone with dementia is by offering support sensitively and try not to be critical of what they do. It can be very important for the person with dementia to feel that they''re still useful. In the early stages, memory aids can be used around the home to help the person remember where things are. For example, you could put pictures on cupboard doors of what''s inside, such as cups and saucers. This may help to trigger their memory and enable them to retain their independence a little longer. Keeping up hobbies and interests when someone has dementia Many people with dementia will still enjoy their hobbies or interests. For example, if they like cooking, they may be able to help make a meal. Going for a walk or gardening is a simple way to get some exercise and a sense of achievement. Or they may prefer listening to music or playing a board game. Caring for a pet cat or dog can bring a lot of pleasure to some people. If the person you care for was very sociable and outgoing, or if they have a large family, they may really enjoy visits from one or two family members or friends. However, they may struggle to keep up with conversations if they have a lot of visitors at the same time. You can find tips and ideas for people with dementia in this activities guide from Care UK (PDF, 1Mb). Maintaining good health and nutrition in someone with dementia It''s important that the person you care for has a healthy, balanced diet and gets some exercise. The longer they stay fit and healthy, the better their quality of life will be. If you want some easy exercises, try these sitting exercises.  If the person you care for doesn''t eat enough or eats unhealthy food, they can become susceptible to other illnesses. People with dementia can become more confused if they get ill. Common food-related problems for people with dementia include: not recognising foods forgetting what food they like refusing or spitting out food resisting being fed asking for strange food combinations This behaviour is usually due to confusion, or irritation in the mouth caused by dental problems, rather than wanting to be awkward. If you''re concerned about the person''s eating behaviour, speak to your GP. How you can help Involve the person you care for. For example, if they cannot feed themselves, you could put the cutlery in their hand and help guide it to their mouth. You could also involve them in preparing food, if they are able to. Try to stay calm. If you feel stressed at mealtimes, the person you care for will probably be stressed too. Make sure you have plenty of time for meals, so you can deal with any problems that arise. Try to accommodate behaviour changes. It''s likely that the person you care for will change their eating patterns and habits over time. Being aware of this and trying to be flexible will make mealtimes less stressful for both of you. If you think the person you care for may have health or dental problems, get help from your GP or dentist. You could also contact a local carers'' group to speak to other people who may have experienced similar difficulties. If the person with dementia smokes, replace matches with disposable lighters to lower the risk of them accidentally causing a fire. If the person you care for drinks alcohol, check if this is recommended alongside any medication they make take. If in doubt, ask your GP. Dealing with incontinence in someone with dementia Incontinence can be difficult to deal with and can be very upsetting for the person you care for. It''s common for people with dementia to experience incontinence. This can be due to urinary tract infections, constipation causing added pressure on the bladder, or medication. A person with dementia may also simply forget to go to the toilet, or may forget where the toilet is. They may also have lost the ability to tell when they need the toilet. How you can help It''s important to be understanding, retain a sense of humour and remember that it''s not their fault. You may also want to try the following: Put a sign on the toilet door, such as a photo of the toilet. Keep the toilet door open and make sure that the person you care for can access it easily. Make sure they can remove their clothes – some people with dementia can struggle with buttons and zips. Look out for signs that they may need to go to the toilet, such as fidgeting and standing up and down. Get adaptations to the toilet if necessary – you may be able to get these through a care and support needs assessment. If you''re still having problems with incontinence, ask your GP to refer you to a continence advisor, who can advise on things like waterproof bedding or incontinence pads. Helping someone with dementia with their personal hygiene People with dementia can become anxious about certain aspects of personal hygiene and may need help with washing. For example, they may be scared of falling when getting out of the bath, or they may become disorientated in the shower. The person you care for may not want to be left alone or they may resist washing, because they find the lack of privacy undignified and embarrassing. Try to do what''s best for them. Read more about personal hygiene for people who are cared for. Helping someone with dementia sleep well People with dementia often experience disturbed sleep. They may wake up during the night or be restless. These problems may get worse as the illness progresses. People with dementia may also have painful illnesses such as arthritis that cause, or contribute to, sleep problems. Some medication can cause sleepiness during the day and interfere with sleep at night. Sleeping pills can be used with care in people with dementia. However, "sleep hygiene" measures are best for people with dementia – for example, no naps during the day, regular bedtimes, and avoiding alcohol or caffeine at night. Read more about sleeping well. Taking care of your own wellbeing If you or a family member has dementia, you may find it difficult to stay positive. Remember that you are not alone, and that help and support is available. Talk to someone about your worries. This could be a family member or friend, a member of your local dementia support group, or your GP can refer you to a counsellor in your area. It is important for a carer''s physical health and psychological wellbeing that they are able to take a break (respite) from care. Carers may also need respite care if they have to go into hospital or meet other important commitments. Friends, relatives and neighbours can provide respite care at home. You can also arrange home respite care through home care agencies or, in some areas, your local authority. Care away from home can confuse some people with dementia, both while they are away and when they come back. If you decide on respite care away from the person''s home, it is a good idea to visit beforehand to check that it meets the needs of the person with dementia. Caring for someone with dementia can be frustrating and stressful at times, but there are many organisations that can help. For more details, call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053. Lines are open 9am-8pm Monday to Friday and 11am-4pm on weekends. Reading Well Books on Prescription for dementia offers support for people diagnosed with dementia and their relatives and carers. GPs and other health professionals can recommend titles from a list of 25 books on dementia. The books are available for anyone to borrow for free from their local library. Find out about the Reading Well Books on Prescription for dementia titles. Page last reviewed: 09/07/2015 Next review due: 09/07/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

The vaccine protects against cervical cancer. It''s usually given to girls in year eight at schools in England. According to Cancer Research UK, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women under the age of 35. In the UK, 2,900 women a year are diagnosed with cervical cancer, that''s around eight women every day. Around 970 women died from cervical cancer in 2011 in the UK. It''s estimated that about 400 lives could be saved every year in the UK as a result of vaccinating girls before they are infected with HPV. The HPV vaccine is delivered largely through secondary schools, and consists of two injections into the upper arm spaced at least six, and not more than 24 months apart (girls who began vaccination before September 2014 receive three injections). What is HPV? The human papilloma virus (HPV) is the name given to a family of viruses. Different types of HPV are classed as either high risk or low risk, depending on the conditions they can cause. For instance, some types of HPV can cause warts or verrucas. Other types are associated with cervical cancer. In 99% of cases, cervical cancer occurs as a result of a history of infection with high-risk types of HPV. Often, infection with the HPV causes no symptoms.  Read more about HPV. Different types of HPV and what they do There are over 100 different types of HPV, with around 40 types that affect the genital area. Infection with some high-risk types of HPV can cause abnormal tissue growth as well as other cell changes that can lead to cervical cancer. Infection with other types of HPV may cause: genital warts: small growths or skin changes on or around the genital or anal area, these are the most common viral sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the UK skin warts and verrucas vaginal cancer or vulval cancer (although these types of cancer are rare) anal cancer or cancer of the penis some cancers of the head and neck laryngeal papillomas (warts on the voice box or vocal cords) For more information see Why is the HPV vaccine needed? How the HPV vaccine helps A vaccine called Gardasil is used in the national NHS cervical cancer vaccination programme. Gardasil protects against the two types of HPV, between them responsible for more than 70% of cervical cancers in the UK. A bonus of using Gardasil to prevent cervical cancer is that it prevents genital warts too. Which girls should have the HPV vaccination? The HPV vaccine is part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme and is routinely offered to secondary school girls aged 12 and 13. It''s a safe vaccine and there are very few girls who aren''t suitable for HPV vaccination. However, special precautions may need to be taken for girls with certain health conditions, or who have ever had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Read more about who should have the HPV vaccine. Why is the HPV vaccine given at such a young age? The HPV virus is very common and is easily spread by sexual activity. As much as half the population will be infected at some time in their life. In most cases, the virus doesn''t do any harm because your immune system gets rid of the infection. But in some cases, the infection persists and can lead to health problems. Although most girls don''t start having sex until after they''re 16 years of age, it''s important that they are protected against HPV infection early enough and a good time is in the early teenage years. Getting the vaccine as early as possible will protect them in the future. Read more about how to prevent HPV infection. How is the HPV vaccine given? The HPV vaccine is currently given as a series of two injections within a six- to 24-month period. Girls who began their course of HPV vaccination before September 2014 receive three injections. Learn more about how the HPV vaccine is given. How long does the HPV vaccine protect for? Studies have already shown that the vaccine protects against HPV infection for around 10 years, although experts expect protection to be for much longer. Can girls who missed HPV vaccination still have it at a later age? Yes, if a girl misses either of her HPV vaccinations, for whatever reason, speak to her nurse or doctor about making another appointment, ideally as close as possible to the original one. Girls can have the HPV vaccination on the NHS up to their eighteenth birthday. Girls who have the HPV vaccination after the age of 15 will need three doses as the response to two doses is not so good in older girls. Cervical screening and the HPV vaccine Cervical screening is a way of picking up abnormal cells in the cervix before they progress to cancer. It''s been shown that early detection and treatment of cervical abnormalities picked up by screening can prevent three-quarters of cervical cancers. The NHS cervical screening programme involves checking women between the ages of 25 and 64 every three to five years for early cervical abnormalities. Regular cervical screening is the best way to identify abnormal cell changes in the cervix. So it''s important that all girls who receive the HPV vaccine also have regular cervical screening once they reach the age of 25. Now, read why it''s so important for 12-13 year-old girls to receive the HPV vaccination and find out more about the safety of the HPV vaccine. There is general information about the HPV vaccine in this NHS leaflet. Read more about how to prevent HPV infection. Read more about how to test for HPV infection.

It can also be claimed to top-up contribution-based JSA (which is based on previous National Insurance contributions). JSA is just one of the benefits you may be eligible for if you have care needs (such as a disability) or you are a carer. You might find it useful to speak to someone at Citizens Advice or Jobcentre Plus about your options if you are on a low income. Eligibility rules for income-based JSA To get income-based JSA, you must sign a Jobseeker’s Agreement, which sets out what you will do to find work and what Jobcentre Plus will do to help you. You must also be: capable of work  available for work  actively seeking work  resident and present in Great Britain, and permitted to work in Great Britain You''re normally expected to look for work of 40 hours a week or more, but if you have a disability or you''re a part-time carer, you may be able to place restrictions on the hours and type of work you''re expected to search for. You can’t claim income-based JSA if: you’re a full-time student you work 16 hours a week or more you have a partner who works 24 hours a week or more your income and savings are too high – for more information, read about what JSA you''ll get on GOV.UK There’s no time limit on receiving income-based JSA, as long as you continue to meet all the rules. There is a time limit, however, on some help that you get, such as housing costs. Age rules for JSA You can claim income-based JSA if you''re over 18 and under pension age. This means that if you''re a man over 60, you can choose between claiming income-based JSA and Pension Credit. You can ask Jobcentre Plus to advise you on the choice, or you can seek independent help, which can be provided through the Citizens Advice Bureau. You can’t normally claim income-based JSA if you''re under 18. However, in special cases, it may be possible for 16- or 17-year-olds to claim, although you need to seek advice about this. Claiming JSA You make your claim for JSA with Jobcentre Plus, or you can apply online. For more information, read about how to claim JSA on GOV.UK. If you receive income-related JSA, you will be entitled to other financial help such as free NHS dental treatment, sight tests, prescriptions and housing grants. You must also have a valid Jobseeker’s Agreement. How much income-based JSA you get depends on your circumstances, including who you can claim for. Your income and capital (for example, your savings) are also taken into account. You can only claim income-based JSA if your capital is below £16,000. Your income includes wages from any part-time work that you or your partner do, any benefits you may be claiming and other sources of income, such as occupational pensions. You will need to give full details of your income and capital when you claim. Who you can claim JSA for You can claim income-based JSA for you and your partner. If you''re in a couple, you may have to consider which one of you should claim. If you''re eligible for income-based JSA but your partner could claim another benefit such as Income Support, Employment and Support Allowance or Pension Credit, you should ask for help to decide which to claim. Interviews for JSA To receive income-based JSA, you must claim and "sign on" correctly, and attend interviews arranged by Jobcentre Plus. To get your claim started, you will have two interviews: one to establish your Jobseeker’s Agreement and one to establish your income and savings, so that the correct level of benefit can be calculated. You''ll have to attend further interviews when you sign on to check that your Jobseeker’s Agreement is correct and up to date, and to see what steps you''ve taken to seek work. At these interviews, you can discuss problems with your search for work. You should also declare any changes in your circumstances and you may be told of possible jobs, training or employment schemes. If you have disabilities that make seeking work difficult, you could be referred to disability employment advisers who have specific training in giving this assistance. You can ask to be referred to a disability employment adviser if you feel you need extra help. You may be asked to attend additional interviews at any point during your claim. Notification of an interview could be by letter, telephone or email. Missing interviews and failing to sign on If you fail to attend an interview or to sign on (at Jobcentre Plus or by post), you have five days to show that you have good cause for not attending. A good cause could be something like the fact you’re a carer or you’re doing voluntary work and you were given less than 48 hours’ notice of an interview. If you don''t do this, your claim could be stopped. If Jobcentre Plus does not agree that you have good cause for not attending, sanctions can be placed on your benefit. Sanctions To get income-based JSA, you must be capable of work, available for work and actively seeking work. You must also comply with the terms set out in your Jobseeker’s Agreement. If you fail to do so, payment could be stopped. This is known as a "sanction". Sanctions apply for fixed periods. The government''s official online source of information on benefits is GOV.UK.

(237, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/when-is-pneumococcal-vaccine-needed.aspx', 'Who should have the pneumococcal vaccine?', 'When is the pneumococcal vaccine needed? - Vaccinations - NHS Choices', '', 'There are four groups of people who are advised to get vaccinated against pneumococcal infections: babies people aged 65 and over anyone from the ages of 2 to 65 with a long-term health condition anyone at occupational risk, such as welders Babies and the pneumococcal vaccine  Babies are routinely vaccinated with the a type of pneumo jab known as the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) as part of their childhood vaccination programme. They have three injections, which are usually given at: 8 weeks old 16 weeks old One year old Adults aged 65 or over and the pneumococcal vaccine If you are 65 or over, you will be offered a type of pneumo jab known as the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV). This one-off vaccination is very effective at protecting you against serious forms of pneumococcal infection. People with long-term health problems and the pneumococcal vaccine The PPV pneumo jab is available on the NHS for children and adults aged from 2 to 64 years old who are at a higher risk of developing a pneumococcal infection than the general population. This is generally the same people who are eligible for annual flu vaccination. Children up to five years old may also need the PCV (because the PPV injection doesn''t always work in young children). You''re considered to be at a higher risk of a pneumococcal infection if you have: had your spleen removed, your spleen does not work properly or if you are at risk of your spleen not working properly in future (for example if you have coeliac disease) a long-term respiratory disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) heart disease, such as congenital heart disease chronic kidney disease chronic liver disease, such as liver cirrhosis diabetes  a suppressed immune system caused by a health condition such as HIV a suppressed immune system caused by medication such as chemotherapy or steroid tablets  a cochlear implant (a small hearing device fitted inside your ear)  had cerebrospinal fluid (the clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spine) leaking from its usual position – this could be due to an accident or surgery Adults and children over the age of five who are severely immunocompromised (including anyone with leukaemia; multiple myeloma; genetic disorders affecting the immune system or after a bone marrow transplant) usually have a single dose of PCV followed by PPV.  Welders and metal workers and the pneumococcal vaccine  Some people with an occupational risk are advised to have the pneumococcal vaccine, including those who work with metal fumes, such as welders. Booster doses of pneumococcal vaccine If you are at increased risk of a pneumococcal infection, you will be given the PPV vaccination just once, and generally this will protect you for life. However, if your spleen does not work properly or if you have a chronic kidney condition, you may need booster doses of PPV every five years. This is because your levels of antibodies against the infection will decrease over time. What to do if you miss a dose of pneumococcal vaccine If you or your child has missed a routine dose of pneumococcal vaccine, speak to your GP about when you can complete the course. If your child is under the age of one and has missed a dose of the PCV vaccine, they can catch up on the remaining doses they need with two months between each dose. If your child is over the age of one, but under two years old, and has missed a dose of the PCV vaccine, they will be given a single dose of the PCV vaccine. If your child is over the age of two, but under five years old, and has missed a dose of the PCV vaccine, they may need a single dose of the PCV vaccine. However, this may only be recommended if your child is at high risk of pneumococcal infection.

Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) Media last reviewed: 30/09/2015 Next review due: 30/09/2017 Communication comes in different forms, including verbal (spoken), written word, lip reading, sign language and even body language. The person you''re caring for may develop communication issues as a result of a physical condition, such as hearing difficulties or visual impairment, or as a result of a condition affecting the brain, such as Alzheimer''s disease or stroke. These communication problems may come on gradually or could happen overnight, leaving you unprepared and unsure how best to communicate with the person you''re caring for. If a person''s hearing or sight is impaired, body language and tone of voice will become more important. They may also need to learn new skills so they can communicate, such as sign language or lip reading. If a condition or impairment develops suddenly, you''ll need to re-evaluate your methods of communication with that person. It might feel strange at first, but you might need to consider your tone of voice, how quickly you speak, and how you use body language and gestures to emphasise what you are saying. It''s a good idea to express this to the person you care for and find out what helps them or makes your communication clearer. Someone who has a physical or mental illness or disability may be affected by your own and other people''s reactions to their condition. This could have an impact on their ability to communicate. Causes of communication problems Read on or click on the links to go directly to the sections on the particular difficulties carers may face:  Speech and language problems Selective mutism  Deafblindness Rehabilitation after a stroke Using sign language Speech and language problems Speech disorders are communication disorders that interrupt speech. They can result from a stammer, cleft palates, brain injuries or hearing loss, or for no known reason. Language disorders are problems understanding words or using them, such as difficulties resulting from a stroke or a brain injury. Children learn to talk by listening to the people around them and mimicking sounds and mouth shapes. As they develop their language skills, they copy the intonation and speech patterns of those around them. It helps to talk to your child and encourage sounds and speech from an early age. If their progress seems to be delayed, it''s a good idea to take them to your doctor for a check-up. Some people grow out of these disorders during their childhood, while others live with them throughout their adult life. Speech and language therapy can help, particularly in younger people. You can access this through your child''s special educational needs co-ordinator or your GP. For more information, watch the video below about speech and language therapy where a speech and language therapist explains how the therapy works and who can benefit from it. Selective mutism Selective mutism, sometimes described as a "phobia of talking", is an anxiety disorder that prevents children speaking in certain social situations, such as school lessons or in public. However, they''re able to speak freely to close family and friends when nobody else is listening – for example, when they''re at home. If this affects your child, be patient and don''t put pressure on them or use bribes to try to encourage them to speak. Find out more about selective mutism. Deafblindness Deafblind people have an impairment to both vision and hearing. Some impairments are congenital (the person is born deafblind), while others may come later in life through an accident or old age. People who are deafblind may not communicate through words, and it can be difficult to work out the best way to communicate with them. Sometimes deafblind people have difficulty understanding the world around them, and this can make them behave in difficult or inappropriate ways. You may find communicating with a deafblind person frustrating and slow, but with patience and trust a form of communication can develop. Find out more about deafblindness.  The charity Sense supports and campaigns for children and adults who are deafblind. Rehabilitation after a stroke A stroke can cause mental and physical impairments, and make communicating with someone difficult. The person who has had the stroke may find it hard to form words or understand what someone says to them, and this may make it difficult for you to work out what they want. If the person has problems with speech, language, writing or swallowing, they might be referred for speech and language therapy to help them regain those skills. When communicating with someone who is recovering from a stroke, it''s important to give them your full attention and try to avoid any background distractions. Try to speak clearly at a normal volume. Make sure you are listening and watching for the person''s reactions, as not all communication is verbal. It''s important that you do not pretend you''ve understood the person if you haven''t, or try to speak for them. You can get support with stroke-related illness and disability from the Stroke Association, including information, family support, welfare and stroke clubs. The Stroke Association also has volunteers who work to improve the communication skills of people after they have had a stroke. Carer''s tip from Scope "Often, we do so much for people they don''t have the need or opportunity to communicate. This is where ''sabotage'' can come in. Put toys or important objects in a place where the person needs to ask for them; give a meal with no cutlery (again, so they have to ask). Find ways to manipulate situations to necessitate communication." Sources of support There are many different organisations that help people with communication problems. The Aiding Communication in Education Centre offers help and support for children who have complex physical and communication difficulties, and for their parents, carers or therapists. The charity I CAN works to foster the development of speech, language and communication skills. They have a special focus on children with a communication disability. Sign language Sign language is a visual way of communicating using hand gestures, facial expressions and body language. Visual communication methods have been around for thousands of years, and nowadays there are hundreds of different types of sign languages in use across the world. British Sign Language British Sign Language (BSL) is the sign language used by deaf people in the UK. BSL makes use of hand gestures, finger spelling, lip patterns and facial expressions. It has its own grammar that is not based upon spoken English, and even has regional dialects or variations on signs depending upon the area of the country you are in. BSL is constantly evolving in the same way that spoken English changes as new words enter the language. Sign Supported English Sign Supported English (SSE) is a method of communication that uses BSL signs, but the structure and grammar is based on spoken English. This means the signs follow the exact order they would be spoken in. This variation of BSL doesn''t require any knowledge of BSL grammar structure, so it is easier for hearing people to learn. It is often used in schools where deaf children are taught alongside hearing children. Tactile signing There are an estimated 23,000 people in the UK who are deafblind (both visually and hearing impaired). Depending on the level of their hearing and visual impairment, they may be able to hear speech, lip read, or use BSL or braille. Some deafblind people prefer to use tactile signing, such as the deafblind manual alphabet and Block, where words are spelt out on the individual''s hand. The charity Sense provides more information about the different methods of communicating with deafblind people. Makaton Makaton is a language used by adults and children with learning disabilities and communication problems. It uses a combination of picture symbols and hand gestures that are similar to BSL and speech. The aim of Makaton is to help people communicate through speech, so when the user is able to say the correct words they are then encouraged to speak rather than sign. Find out more on the Makaton Charity website. Carer''s tip from Scope "My top tip is Makaton sign language! We are so glad we taught Zoe to use Makaton. Although she can''t yet say any words, signing relieves any frustration no end – she can tell us what she wants, and the signs we use help her understand what we say. It takes a while, but it''s really worth sticking with."

The chickenpox vaccine is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule. It is currently only offered on the NHS to people who are in close contact with someone who is particularly vulnerable to chickenpox or its complications. There are two chickenpox vaccines currently available. The brand names of the chickenpox vaccine are VARIVAX and VARILRIX. Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for VARIVAX. Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for VARILRIX Who is at risk from chickenpox? Chickenpox is a common childhood infection. Usually, it''s mild and complications are rare. Almost all children develop immunity to chickenpox after infection, so most only catch it once. The disease can be more severe in adults. Certain groups of people, however, are at greater risk of serious complications from chickenpox. These include: people who have weakened immune systems through illnesses such as HIV or treatments like chemotherapy pregnant women – chickenpox can be very serious for an unborn baby when a pregnant woman catches the infection. It can cause a range of serious birth defects, as well as severe disease in the baby when it is born. Read more about what to do if you catch or are exposed to chickenpox in pregnancy Who should have the chickenpox vaccine? It is recommended for certain individuals, such as: non-immune healthcare workers people who come into close contact with someone who has a weakened immune system This is to lower the chances of infecting people at risk. For example, if you''re having chemotherapy treatment, it''s advisable that non-immune children close to you are given the chickenpox vaccine. The vaccine would also be recommended if you were about to start work in a radiotherapy department and had not had chickenpox before. Read more about who should have the chickenpox vaccine. How the chickenpox vaccine works The chickenpox vaccine is a live vaccine and contains a small amount of weakened chickenpox-causing virus. The vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies that will help protect against chickenpox. Read more about live vaccines. Read more about chickenpox vaccine side effects. How is the chickenpox vaccine given? The vaccine is given as two separate injections, usually into the upper arm, four to eight weeks apart. How effective is the chickenpox vaccine? It''s been shown that 9 out of 10 children vaccinated with a single dose will develop immunity against chickenpox. Two doses are recommended, as this gives an even better immune response. The vaccination is not quite as effective after childhood. It''s estimated that three-quarters of teenagers and adults who are vaccinated will become immune to chickenpox.

(240, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/indigestion-heartburn-pregnant.aspx', 'Dyspepsia in pregnancy', 'Indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy - Pregnancy and baby guide - NHS Choices', '', 'Indigestion – also known as dyspepsia – in pregnancy is partly caused by hormonal changes, and in later pregnancy by the growing womb pressing on your stomach.  As many as eight out of 10 women experience indigestion at some point during their pregnancy. The symptoms of indigestion can include feeling full, feeling sick or nauseous, and burping. The symptoms usually come on after eating food. Heartburn is a strong, burning pain in the chest caused by stomach acid passing from your stomach into your oesophagus (the tube that leads from your mouth to your stomach).  You can help ease the discomfort of indigestion and heartburn by making changes to your diet and lifestyle, and there are treatments that are safe to take in pregnancy. Talk to your midwife, GP or pharmacist. You can also find out more by reading this page or clicking on the links to go directly to the relevant information. Symptoms of indigestion Causes of indigestion in pregnancy Treatment for indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy Self-help tips for indigestion and heartburn Symptoms of indigestion in pregnancy Symptoms of indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy are the same as for anyone else with the condition. The main symptom is pain or a feeling of discomfort in your chest or stomach. This usually happens soon after eating or drinking, but there can sometimes be a delay between eating a meal and developing indigestion. You may experience indigestion at any point during your pregnancy, although your symptoms may be more frequent and severe during later pregnancy, from 27 weeks onwards. As well as pain, indigestion may cause: heartburn, a burning sensation caused by acid passing from the stomach into the oesophagus feeling uncomfortable or heavy belching (burping) regurgitation (food coming back up from the stomach) bloating nausea (feeling sick) vomiting (being sick) Causes of indigestion in pregnancy The symptoms of indigestion (dyspepsia), including heartburn, are caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive protective lining (mucosa) of your digestive system. The stomach acid breaks down the mucosa, which causes irritation and leads to the symptoms of indigestion. When you''re pregnant, you are more likely to have indigestion due to:  hormonal changes that your body is going through your growing womb (uterus) pressing on your stomach the relaxing of the lower oesophageal sphincter (ring of muscle) that acts like a gate between your stomach and your oesophagus, allowing stomach acid to leak back up You may be more likely to get indigestion in pregnancy if: you had indigestion before you were pregnant you have been pregnant before you are in the latter stages of pregnancy Your GP or midwife will usually be able to diagnose indigestion or heartburn from your symptoms and by asking you some questions. For example, they might ask:  how the symptoms are affecting your day-to-day life what your usual eating habits are if you have tried any treatments already if you experienced indigestion or any other stomach conditions before you were pregnant Your GP or midwife may also examine your chest and stomach. They may press gently on different areas of your chest and stomach to see whether this is painful. Treatments for indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy In some cases, changes to your diet and lifestyle may be enough to control indigestion, particularly if the symptoms are mild. If you have severe indigestion, or if changes to your diet and lifestyle don''t work, your GP or midwife may suggest using medication to help ease your symptoms. Several indigestion medicines are safe to use during pregnancy. However, check with your GP, midwife or pharmacist before taking anything they have not recommended. The types of medicines that may be prescribed for indigestion and heartburn during pregnancy are: Antacids Antacids are a type of medicine that can provide immediate relief from indigestion. They work by neutralising the acid in your stomach (making it less acidic) so that it no longer irritates the protective lining (mucosa) of your digestive system. Alginates Some antacids are combined with another type of medicine known as an alginate. This helps relieve indigestion caused by acid reflux. Acid reflux occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your oesophagus and irritates its protective lining. Alginates work by forming a foam barrier that floats on the surface of your stomach contents. This keeps stomach acid in your stomach and away from your oesophagus. In most cases, antacids and alginates can effectively control the symptoms of indigestion during pregnancy. Choice and dosage A number of antacids are available over-the-counter from your pharmacist without a prescription. Ask your pharmacist for advice about which ones are suitable for you. You may only need to take antacids and alginates when you start to experience symptoms. In other cases, your GP may recommend that you take these medicines before your symptoms are expected, such as: before a meal before bed It is safe to use antacids and alginates while you are pregnant as long as you do not take more than the recommended dose. Follow the instructions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine to ensure that you take it correctly. Side effects from antacids are rare, but can include: diarrhoea  constipation  Iron supplements If you are prescribed an antacid medicine and you are also taking iron supplements, do not take them at the same time. Antacids can prevent iron from being properly absorbed by your body. Take your antacid at least two hours before or after your iron supplement. Acid-suppressing medicines If antacids and alginates do not improve your symptoms of indigestion, your GP may prescribe a different medicine that suppresses the acid in your stomach. There are two acid-suppressing medicines that are safe to use during pregnancy: ranitidine omeprazole As with antacids and alginates, follow the dosage instructions on the patient information leaflet or packet. Ranitidine Ranitidine is usually prescribed as tablets to be taken twice a day. Follow the dosage instructions, as your medicine may not work if you only take it when you have symptoms. Ranitidine rarely causes any side effects. Omeprazole Omeprazole is usually prescribed as a tablet to take once a day. After five days, your symptoms should have improved. If not, your dose may need to be increased. In some cases, omeprazole may cause side effects such as: headaches diarrhoea nausea vomiting Self-help tips for indigestion in pregnancy You may not need medicine to control your symptoms. Your GP or midwife may suggest some of the following changes to your diet and lifestyle. In many cases, these changes can be enough to ease your symptoms. Stop smoking to banish indigestion Smoking when you''re pregnant can cause indigestion and seriously affect your health, as well as the health of your unborn baby. Smoking increases the risk of:  your baby being born prematurely (before week 37 of your pregnancy) your baby being born with a low birth weight cot death, or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) When you smoke, the chemicals you inhale can contribute to your indigestion. These chemicals can cause the ring of muscle at the lower end of your oesophagus to relax. This allows stomach acid to leak back up into your oesophagus more easily (known as acid reflux). If you smoke, quitting is the best thing that you can do for your own and your baby''s health. You can speak to your GP or midwife for more information, or you can call the NHS Smokefree Helpline, which offers support and encouragement to help you quit smoking. You can call them on 0300 123 1044 or go to the NHS Smokefree website. Here are 8 steps to take to help you stop smoking right away. Avoid alcohol to ease indigestion Drinking alcohol can contribute to the symptoms of indigestion. During pregnancy, it can also put your unborn baby at risk of developing serious birth defects. Find out more about alcohol and pregnancy. The Department of Health recommends that all pregnant women avoid drinking alcohol completely during pregnancy. It advises that if you do choose to drink while you''re pregnant, to minimise risks to your baby you should not drink more than 1-2 units of alcohol once or twice a week, and should not get drunk. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant should avoid drinking alcohol in the first three months of pregnancy because there may be an increased risk of miscarriage. One UK unit is 10ml (or eight grams) of pure alcohol. This is equal to:  half a pint of beer, lager or cider at 3.5% alcohol by volume (ABV: you can find this on the label) a single measure (25ml) of spirit, such as whisky, gin, rum or vodka, at 40% ABV  half a standard (175ml) glass of wine at 11.5% ABV You can find out how many units there are in different types and brands of drinks with the Drinkaware unit calculator. If you have difficulty cutting down what you drink, talk to your midwife, doctor or pharmacist. Confidential help and support is available from local counselling services (look in the telephone directory or contact Drinkline on 0300 123 1110). Eat healthily to avoid indigestion You are more likely to get indigestion if you are very full, so regularly eating large amounts of food may make your symptoms worse. If you are pregnant, it can be tempting to eat more than you would normally, but this may not be good for you or your baby. You don''t need to "eat for two". During pregnancy you do not need to go on a special diet, but it is important to eat a variety of different foods every day to get the right balance of nutrients that you and your baby need. Find out more about eating a healthy diet in pregnancy and foods to avoid. Change your eating habits In some cases, you may be able to control your indigestion by making changes to the way you eat. For example:  it may help to eat smaller meals more frequently, rather than larger meals three times a day avoid eating within three hours of going to bed at night sit up straight when you eat because this will take the pressure off your stomach Drinking a glass of milk may relieve heartburn (the burning sensation from stomach acid leaking up into your oesophagus). You may want to keep a glass of milk beside your bed in case you wake up with heartburn in the night. Avoid indigestion triggers You may find that your indigestion is made worse by certain triggers, such as:  drinking fruit juice eating chocolate bending over Make a note of any particular food, drink or activity that seems to make your indigestion worse and avoid them if possible. This may mean: eating less rich, spicy and fatty foods cutting down on drinks that contain caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola (find out more about caffeine and pregnancy) Prop your head up When you go to bed, use a couple of pillows to prop your head and shoulders up, or raise the head of your bed by a few inches by putting something underneath the mattress. The slight slope should help prevent stomach acid from moving up into your oesophagus while you sleep.  Prescription medicines Speak to your GP if you are taking medication for another condition, such as antidepressants or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and you think it may be contributing to your indigestion. Your GP may be able to prescribe an alternative medicine. Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are advised to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care.

In addition, the HPV vaccine can also protect against HPV-6 and HPV-11, the two strains of HPV that cause most cases of genital warts.  How HPV causes cervical cancer If you become infected with one of the high-risk strains of HPV, and your immune system does not deal with it, the infection can lead to the growth of pre-cancerous cells in your cervix. This is known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). CIN is not cancer but, if left untreated, it can develop into cancer in some women. This can take up to 10 years.

Read on for advice and information, or click on the links below to take you to a particular area of interest:  Feeding and eating Sleeping  Using the toilet  Moving around easily  Challenging behaviour  Communicating with your child  Feeding and eating A disabled child may have problems with feeding and eating for many different reasons, such as: physical problems that cause difficulty swallowing, chewing, sucking or digesting certain foods limited mobility, which might make it difficult to sit up to eat or drink  a learning disability, which could make it more difficult to learn appropriate behaviour at mealtimes It might take longer for your child to be able to feed themselves, but developing the skills to do so can also help them in other ways, such as with speech and language development and co-ordination. Your health visitor can advise you on many aspects of feeding and weaning your baby. As your child grows, you might be able to get a referral from your GP or health visitor for any further specialist help you might need. For example:  A speech and language therapist may be able to help with physical issues such as chewing and swallowing. An occupational therapist can advise you about aids that might help your child, such as special plates, bowls, cups, adapted cutlery or non-slip mats.  A physiotherapist or occupational therapist can advise you on getting your child into the right physical position to eat. A dietitian can help you if you''re concerned that your child isn''t eating enough. If your child needs to be fed through a tube that goes directly into their stomach (either temporarily or permanently), you can get advice from the support group PINNT (Patients on Intravenous and Naso-gastric and Nutrition Therapy). These issues can take a toll on your own wellbeing. If you''re feeling isolated, you may find it helpful to search for Carers emotional support services in your area. Sleeping and your child If a child doesn''t sleep well, tiredness can affect the whole family. Disabled children can have sleep problems for a range of physical reasons, such as muscle spasms or breathing difficulties, depending on their particular condition. Children with some learning disabilities may find it hard to understand why and when they need to sleep. Your health visitor or community nurse should be able to suggest ways to encourage good sleep patterns. Your GP may also be able to help or refer you to a sleep specialist or psychologist if necessary. There is useful information in Contact a Family''s leaflet (PDF, 1.45Mb) on this subject. If your sleep is constantly interrupted, you can ask for a carer''s assessment (or a re-assessment) from social services. They may be able to provide short breaks from caring so that you can get some undisturbed sleep. Your child might also qualify for Disability Living Allowance (DLA), or a higher rate of DLA if they already get it, if they need constant care and attention at night because of sleep problems. Support groups and national organisations, such as Scope or the National Autistic Society, can often provide advice on sleep for families of children with certain conditions. You can find support in your area in the directory of local carers'' services. Potty-training All children are different, but most show signs of being ready to learn to use the toilet at around two or three years old. Some disabled children may not be ready until they''re older or they may take longer to learn. This could be because of learning disabilities or physical challenges, such as impaired mobility, motor skills or muscle tone. Some children may never learn to use the toilet on their own. Some conditions may mean that a colostomy or ileostomy is needed. If your child''s condition will affect their ability to control their bladder or bowel movements, their doctor may be able to refer you to a specialist for advice on managing their continence. An occupational therapist can advise you about special potties or toilet seats if your child needs help with sitting, or about any bathroom adaptations that might be useful. A physiotherapist can also advise about issues such as moving and handling your child, or finding the best position for your child to be able to use the toilet. Your local health authority''s incontinence service may be able to supply items such as larger nappies, pads and bedding protection once your child is over a certain age (this may vary from area to area). If they are unable to do this, they can tell you where you can buy them privately. If you have a water meter and your child''s condition means that you have to do a lot of laundry, you can apply to your water supply company to cap the cost of your water under the WaterSure scheme. Ofwat has contact details for water companies. The Family Fund can also give grants to low-income families for a washing machine or tumble drier. Search the directory of carers'' services for local support groups and services. Your child''s ability to move around If you''re concerned about your child''s ability to move around normally, your GP may refer you to a nearby physiotherapist to assess their mobility needs. As part of the assessment, the physiotherapist will discuss any mobility aids that could help your child: Walking aids can be loaned from the local hospital or community health service. Wheelchairs, buggies and adapted seating may be provided by your local NHS wheelchair service. You can get contact details for your local wheelchair service from your GP or physiotherapist. The charity Whizz-Kidz can provide children under 18 with mobility equipment that''s not available from the NHS. They also offer wheelchair skills training. Go Kids Go! also provides free wheelchair skills courses. If your child gets the high rate mobility component of Disability Living Allowance, you can apply to the Motability scheme to buy a powered wheelchair or buggy. If you drive, you could apply for road tax exemption and a Blue Badge for disabled parking. The Blue Badge may be awarded if your child is two years old or over and has a permanent disability which makes walking difficult. If your child is under two, you may get a Blue Badge if they need to have bulky medical equipment with them or need to be near the vehicle in case they require urgent medical treatment. Challenging behaviour and your child Challenging behaviour can be common in children with learning or sensory disabilities. This is because communication problems can make it difficult for them to express their needs, likes and dislikes. Challenging behaviour can take many forms, from aggression to withdrawal. Read more on challenging behaviour in children. Communicating with your child Some physical conditions and learning disabilities can mean that your child has little or no clear speech, or their speech may be slow to develop. You may worry about how well they will communicate with you and other people as they grow up. A wide range of equipment and techniques, which have an umbrella term of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) can support or replace speech, including signing (perhaps using a system such as Makaton), symbols, word boards and electronic voice output communication aids (VOCAs). A speech and language therapist can assess your child and help you decide the most appropriate aids. Find out more about caring and communication problems.

Girls are offered the vaccine to protect them against cervical cancer. Around 1,000 women die from cervical cancer in the UK each year. Read the NHS leaflet about the HPV vaccine. Why will my daughter be offered the HPV vaccination before she’s 16? The virus that causes cervical cancer, called human papilloma virus (HPV), is spread by having sex or being sexually intimate with another person who has the virus. So it’s natural that, as a parent, you may question why the HPV vaccine will be given to your daughter before she reaches the age of consent at 16. While most girls don’t start having sex until they’re 16 or older, it’s best for them to be vaccinated a few years earlier so they get the most benefit from the vaccine. If the HPV vaccine is given after a young woman has become sexually active, it’s possible she may already be infected with the virus, and it’s therefore too late for the vaccine to fully protect her. Read more about the HPV virus and how it affects you. What if my daughter doesn’t want the HPV vaccination? Your daughter has to sign a consent form before she can be vaccinated. So she doesn’t have to have the HPV vaccine if she doesn’t want to. However, it’s worth making sure she’s thought things through. The HPV vaccine has a good safety record and will protect her against cervical cancer for many years. Suggest she speaks to the nurse or doctor if she wants more information, on her own, or with you if she’d prefer. Read more about HPV vaccination. What if my daughter wants the vaccination, but I’d rather she didn’t have it? The decision to have the vaccine is legally your daughter''s, as long as she understands the issues in giving consent. Discuss this with your daughter, the doctor or nurse to get more information. Page last reviewed: 24/09/2014 Next review due: 24/09/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

I have had flu symptoms for five days. Can I have visitors? When am I most at risk from flu? Flu circulates every winter. This means many people get ill around the same time. In a bad year, this can be an epidemic. However, it is impossible to predict how many cases of flu there will be each year. Can I go to work or school if I have been in contact with somebody who has recently been diagnosed with flu? Yes. You should go about your everyday business, but stay at home if you develop flu-like symptoms. Does everyone need a flu jab? No, just people who are at special risk of problems if they catch flu. Ask your GP about having an NHS flu vaccination if: you''re aged 65 or over you''re pregnant you have a serious medical condition you live in a residential or nursing home you''re the main carer for an elderly or disabled person whose welfare may be at risk if you fall ill your child is in an at-risk group and is aged six months to two years You should also be offered the flu vaccination if you are a healthcare or social care worker directly involved in patient care. Some pharmacies also offer free NHS flu vaccination to eligible adults. They do not offer this service for children.  Find out more about who should have the flu vaccine. Why are certain groups targeted for the flu jab? Complications such as bronchitis and pneumonia are more common in people with other diseases, especially if they are also elderly. Almost all of the deaths related to flu are in people in these groups. In long-stay residential homes, vaccination prevents the rapid spread of flu among residents. Can a GP vaccinate anyone else? The final decision about who should be offered the vaccination on the NHS is a matter for your GP, based on your medical history and circumstances. Is my child entitled to the flu jab? If your child is aged between six months and two years old and is in a high-risk group for flu, they should have the flu jab. If your child is between two and 17 years old and is in a high-risk group for flu, they should have the nasal spray flu vaccine instead of the injection. Children aged two and three plus children in school years one, two and three are also eligible for the nasal spray flu vaccine. How long will the flu jab protect me for? The flu jab will provide protection for you for the upcoming flu season. People eligible for flu vaccination should have the vaccine each year. Can I have the flu jab while I''m taking antibiotics? Yes, it''s fine to have the flu jab while you are taking a course of antibiotics, provided you are not ill with fever. How long does the flu vaccine take to become effective? It takes between 10 and 14 days for your immune system to respond fully after you''ve had the flu jab. If I had the flu jab last year, do I need it again now? Yes. The viruses that cause flu can change every year, which means the flu (and the vaccine) this winter may be different from last winter. Can the flu jab cause flu? No. The vaccine does not contain any live viruses, so it cannot cause flu. You may get a slight temperature and aching muscles for a couple of days afterwards, and your arm may feel a bit sore where you had the injection. Other reactions are rare, and flu jabs are very safe. When is the best time to get my flu jab? The best time is as soon as your GP gets supplies of the vaccine. This will usually be between September and early November. But don''t worry if you''ve missed this time, you can have the flu jab later in the winter although it''s best to get it as early as possible. Is there anyone who cannot have a flu jab? Yes. You should not have the flu vaccine if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a flu vaccine or one of its ingredients. This happens very rarely. You also need to take precautions if you have an egg allergy. Read more about who should not have the flu jab. Can I get the flu vaccine privately? People who aren''t eligible for a flu jab on the NHS can pay for a flu vaccination privately. The flu vaccine may be available from pharmacies or in supermarkets. It is provided on a private patient basis and you have to pay. The vaccine costs up to £20.   Why is it recommended that healthcare workers are vaccinated? Vaccination prevents healthcare workers passing flu on to, or getting flu from, their patients. It also helps the NHS to keep running effectively during a flu outbreak, when GPs and hospital services are particularly busy. Can I have a flu jab if I''m breastfeeding? Yes. The vaccine poses no risk to a breastfeeding mother or her baby, or to pregnant women. Is it OK to have the flu vaccine during pregnancy? Yes. The flu vaccine is recommended for pregnant women and is safe to have at any stage of pregnancy, including in the first trimester and right up to the expected due date. It helps protect the mother-to-be and her newborn baby from catching flu. Read more about the flu jab in pregnancy. How do I get the flu vaccine if my GP has run out?  If your GP has run out of flu vaccine, they should work with neighbouring practices to obtain further supplies. The vaccine manufacturers and suppliers usually have stocks available for ordering. Some local pharmacies offer a free flu vaccination service to NHS patients who are eligible for flu vaccination. This service is only available for adults, however, not children. Do I need Tamiflu and how do I get a prescription? Tamiflu is an antiviral medicine that is used to treat flu. Your GP will decide if you need Tamiflu and will prescribe it if necessary. I have had flu symptoms for five days. Can I have visitors? You are probably not infectious after five days and will be clear of flu by seven days.

Find out how you can get help: Accessing public transport Getting discounts on public transport Getting NHS help with travel costs Accessing community transport schemes If you have mobility problems and you need a car or similar powered vehicle to get around, you may need help with covering the costs. You may be able to get help through: Discounted or free road tax Blue Badge parking permit Help with the cost of buying or hiring a vehicle through the Motability scheme Using public transport with a disability All public transport vehicles have to be "accessible" to avoid causing difficulty for disabled passengers. Public transport vehicles also have to accept guide dogs or assistance dogs. However, if you are using public transport, it’s worth contacting the transport operator before you travel to make sure they are able to offer the assistance you require. By law, all public transport buses will have to meet specific disability standards by 2017. Buses and trains will usually have priority seating for older people and people with disabilities. They will also usually have space and wide doors for wheelchairs. Some buses, trains and trams are fitted with automatic ramps, but many still require assistance or ramps to be manually fitted by station staff or the driver. The London Underground is being upgraded to improve step-free access, but large parts will remain largely inaccessible to people with mobility problems for the foreseeable future. Staff at Underground stations are trained to help assist people move around the underground system – for example, by helping you avoid escalators and calling ahead to arrange for assistance at your destination. Both the Docklands Light Railway and London trams are entirely step-free. Discounts on public transport for older people and disabled people Older people and people with disabilities can travel free on local buses anywhere in England between 9.30am and 11pm Monday to Friday, and at any time during the weekend and on bank holidays. Some authorities offer free travel for longer periods, and some allow a companion to travel with the pass holder for free. You may have to apply through your local authority, but in most areas you can apply online for an older person’s bus pass or for a disabled person’s bus pass. You can get a bus pass that allows you to travel for free at any time of day, and in London a Freedom Pass will let you travel for free on most forms of public transport.  Some services, such as London’s trams, will let wheelchair users travel for free without a pass. If you regularly travel by train, it’s probably worth getting a Disabled Person’s Railcard, giving you a third off the price of rail tickets. Check the eligibility criteria to see if you are eligible for a Disabled Railcard Card. Children aged five to 16 with disabilities are eligible for a Disabled Person''s Railcard, allowing an adult to travel with them for a third of the cost of an adult fare, while the child pays the normal child fare. Taxi and private hire companies can provide wheelchair-accessible vehicles if you let them know when you book a vehicle. Some councils also offer taxi voucher schemes for those who may find it difficult to use public transport, because they are frail or disabled. NHS help with travel and transport costs You may need help getting to and from hospital appointments, and with transport costs if you’re on a low income. Help with travel costs can include hospital transport. Hospital travel scheme If you pay to travel to a hospital or other NHS premises for NHS-funded treatment or diagnostic tests, you may be able to claim a refund through a scheme to help with travel costs to hospital for patients who are on certain benefits, including: Income Support Income-based Jobseeker''s Allowance Income-related Employment and Support Allowance Pension Credit guarantee credit Patients are also eligible if their income is £15,050 or less and they get Child Tax Credit or Working Tax Credit with the disability element or severe disability element. Under this Healthcare Travel Costs Scheme, you can claim at the NHS hospital or clinic at the time of the appointment and payment will be made in cash. NHS low income support scheme If a patient doesn''t receive any of the above benefits, they may still be able to get help if they''re on a low income, through the NHS Low Income Scheme. A claim for travel costs can be made on form HC1. This is available from your local Jobcentre Plus office or from the hospital. A carer’s travel costs can also be covered by this scheme if a doctor confirms that the person you look after needs someone to travel with them. Community transport schemes Check with your local council whether your area has a community transport scheme. These schemes provide transport to and from hospitals, doctors’ and dentists’ surgeries, and opticians and chiropodists. Many areas offer a free "Dial-a-Ride" service, offering door-to-door transport for people unable to use normal buses. Some schemes require users to register and may incur a cost. Carers may be able to travel with the person they care for, for an additional charge. Find your local''s council contact details. The British Red Cross runs a similar transport service in some areas. Contact your local Red Cross branch for information. Cars and parking Vehicle road tax exemption and reduction If you’re disabled or have a serious long-term condition, you may be exempt from vehicle excise duty (known as road tax or car tax). It’s worth noting that mobility scooters and "class 3" powered wheelchairs (limited to 8mph or 4mph on pavements) are exempt from vehicle excise duty. You’ll qualify for tax exemption if you’re eligible for the higher rate of the mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance (DLA), enhanced rate mobility component of Personal Independence Payment (PIP), or War Pensioner''s Mobility Supplement. The vehicle must be registered in your name and can be only be used for your benefit. You can nominate someone else to drive for you, but they cannot use the vehicle for their own personal needs. You apply for exemption from road tax when you apply for your road tax online, or by phone or at a post office. If you get PIP at the standard mobility rate, you will be eligible for a reduction in road tax. You will have to apply directly to the DVLA for a road tax reduction. Blue Badge disabled parking scheme If you have severe mobility problems that make using public transport difficult, you may be able to get a "Blue Badge" parking permit for your car. This lets you park closer to places you wish to visit, such as in marked disabled parking bays. You may also be able to: park for free within certain time limits in some places  park on single and double yellow lines  stay longer in on-street time-limited parking bays Blue Badge schemes are run by councils, and most will let you apply for a Blue Badge online. Central London is exempt from the national Blue Badge regulations and the central London boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, Camden, Westminster and City of London do not fully operate the Blue Badge scheme. However, if you are exempt from road tax or have a Blue Badge permit, you may be able to get an exemption from paying the central London congestion charge. Motability scheme The Motability scheme allows some disabled people getting DLA, PIP or War Pensioners’ Mobility Supplement to obtain a car, powered wheelchair or scooter. The scheme uses some or all of your mobility benefit payments to cover the cost of "contract hire" or "hire purchase" of an appropriate vehicle. You can also pay an extra amount of money if you want a more expensive vehicle. With hire purchase, the price of the car will be agreed directly with the Motability dealer, and you will own the vehicle outright at the end of the agreement. With contract hire, you won’t own a vehicle, but you will get a new car every three years, full insurance for the driver and passengers, servicing, maintenance and repairs, vehicle excise duty, replacement tyres and breakdown cover. Adaptations to the car can be made if needed, although there may be an extra charge for some adaptations. Under the Motability scheme, cars can also be adapted for people in wheelchairs. If you don''t need or want a car, you can transfer your allowance to lease a scooter or powered wheelchair.

Flu can be unpleasant, but if you are otherwise healthy it will usually clear up on its own within a week. However, flu can be more severe in certain people, such as: anyone aged 65 and over pregnant women children and adults with an underlying health condition (particularly long-term heart or respiratory disease) children and adults with weakened immune systems Anyone in these risk groups is more likely to develop potentially serious complications of flu, such as pneumonia (a lung infection), so it''s recommended that they have a flu vaccine every year to protect them.  The injected flu vaccine is offered free on the NHS annually to: adults over the age of 18 at risk of flu (including everyone aged 65 and over) pregnant women  children aged six months to two years at risk of flu Find out more about who should have the flu jab. Flu nasal spray vaccination The flu vaccine is routinely given on the NHS as an annual nasal spray to: children aged two, three and four years old plus children in school years one, two and three.  children aged two to 17 years at a particular risk of flu Read more about the flu nasal spray for children. 65 and overs and the flu jab You are eligible for the flu vaccine this year (2016-17) if you will be aged 65 and over on March 31 2017 – that is, you were born on or before March 31 1952. So, if you are currently 64 but will be 65 on March 31 2017, you do qualify. Where to get the flu jab You can have your NHS flu jab at: your GP surgery a local pharmacy offering the service your midwifery service if they offer it for pregnant women Some community pharmacies now offer flu vaccination to adults (but not children) at risk of flu including pregnant women, people aged 65 and over, people with long-term health conditions and carers. If you have your flu jab at a pharmacy, you don''t have to inform your GP – it is up to the pharmacist to do that. How effective is the flu jab? Flu vaccine is the best protection we have against an unpredictable virus that can cause unpleasant illness in children and severe illness and death among at-risk groups, including older people, pregnant women and those with an underlying medical health condition. Studies have shown that the flu jab does work and will help prevent you getting the flu. It won''t stop all flu viruses and the level of protection may vary between people, so it''s not a 100% guarantee that you''ll be flu-free, but if you do get flu after vaccination it''s likely to be milder and shorter-lived than it would otherwise have been. There is also evidence to suggest that the flu jab can reduce your risk of having a stroke. Over time, protection from the injected flu vaccine gradually decreases and flu strains often change. So new flu vaccines are produced each year which is why people advised to have the flu jab need it every year too. Read more about how the flu jab works. Flu jab side effects Serious side effects of the injected flu vaccine are very rare. You may have a slight temperature and aching muscles for a couple of days after having the jab, and your arm may be a bit sore where you were injected. Read more about the side effects of the flu jab. When to have a flu jab The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn, from the beginning of October to early November, but don''t worry if you''ve missed it, you can have the vaccine later in winter. Ask your GP or pharmacist. The flu jab for 2016/17 Each year, the viruses that are most likely to cause flu are identified in advance and vaccines are made to match them as closely as possible. The vaccines are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Most injected flu vaccines protect against three types of flu virus: A/H1N1 – the strain of flu that caused the swine flu pandemic in 2009 A/H3N2 – a strain of flu that mainly affects the elderly and people with risk factors like a long term health condition. In 2016/17 the vaccine will contain an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 H3N2-like virus Influenza B - a strain of flu that particularly affects children. In 2016/17 the vaccine will contain B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus The nasal spray flu vaccine and some injected vaccines also offer protection against a fourth B strain of virus, which in 2016/17 is the B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus. Is there anyone who shouldn''t have the flu jab? Most adults can have the injected flu vaccine, but you should avoid it if you have had a serious allergic reaction to a flu jab in the past. Read more about who shouldn''t have the flu vaccine. You can find out more by reading the answers to the most common questions that people have about the flu vaccine.

(249, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/vaccination-appointment-tips-for-parents.aspx', 'Vaccination tips for parents', 'Vaccination appointment tips for parents - Vaccinations - NHS Choices', '', 'Make the vaccination appointment You''ll automatically get an appointment letter when your baby or child is due for a routine vaccination. It could be at your GP practice or a local child health clinic. Let the clinic know as soon as possible if you can''t attend the appointment, so they can rearrange the vaccination for as close to the recommended age as possible. Take the red book with you Remember to take your Personal Child Health Record (PCHR) to the appointment, so details of the vaccination can be recorded in it. In England, this usually has a red cover and is often called the "red book". Wear vaccination-friendly clothes Dressing your baby or child in the right clothes can save time and effort at the vaccination clinic. Avoid chunky, padded or tight-fitting clothes with lots of buttons and straps. They take time to remove and put back on. Babies under 12 months have injections in the thigh. Toddlers and older children have them in the arm. Thin cotton layers fastened with poppers are perfect for babies, and loose or short sleeves for toddlers and older children. Get to the vaccination appointment on time Give yourself enough time to get to your appointment. If you rush, you may get stressed. Your child will sense that and become anxious. Ideally, allow yourself an hour. Clinics can run behind schedule and you need time to ask the doctor or nurse questions. Stay calm during the vaccination It''s natural to worry that your child''s vaccination will hurt. In fact, having a vaccination is often painless.  Try to stay calm and treat the procedure in a matter-of-fact way. If you''re anxious, your child may sense this and also become anxious and restless. Older children generally find it less traumatic if parents explain to them that vaccination is a good thing. Use plain language to prepare your child for what''s going to happen. Hold your child during the vaccination Usually, the doctor or nurse will ask you to hold your child on your knee while they vaccinate them. If the injection is quick, your child won''t even see the needle or notice that anything has happened. If you''re nervous about seeing your child having an injection, ask a nurse or another member of staff to hold them for you. Children rarely faint after a vaccination, but if your child is prone to fainting, ask if they can have the vaccination lying down. After the vaccination Make sure that the type of injection (and where it was given) is noted down in your red book and in your child''s GP records. Your child may need this information later in life – for example, for school trips, when applying for certain jobs, or going to live or study abroad. Give a painkiller for fever Vaccinations shouldn''t hurt, although the area where the needle goes in can be sore and red afterwards. Your child may develop a mild fever after the vaccination. If this happens, you can give them infant paracetamol or ibuprofen to bring their temperature down. With Men B vaccination (given at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and one year) it''s recommended that you routinely give your baby liquid paracetamol after the vaccination to reduce the risk of fever. Allergic reactions to vaccinations A serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a vaccination is very rare. If this does happen, it''s quick and usually happens within minutes. The people who give vaccinations are trained to deal with anaphylactic reactions and, with treatment, children recover completely. Before the injection, tell the nurse about any bad reactions your child has had after any previous vaccinations. Give permission for relatives to take children for vaccinations  If a relative, friend or childminder is taking your child for vaccinations, they will need permission to do so from the person with parental responsibility. To do this, you could inform the surgery in advance or you could give them a letter with your contact details on so the surgery can call you if they need to speak to you.    What to do if you miss a vaccination Don''t panic. You don''t have to start the course of vaccines again, just make a new appointment as soon as you can.

Poor hygiene can cause skin complaints and infections, and be a source of discomfort and low self-esteem. How to maintain daily hygiene To maintain daily personal hygiene, you should make sure: your hands are washed after you''ve used the toilet your genitals and anal area are washed every day your face is washed daily you''re fully bathed or showered at least twice a week your teeth are brushed twice a day It is also important that you have regular dental checks. Find out more about dental treatment for people with special needs. Help with washing and bathing For most people, washing is a very private activity. If you are helping someone else wash or bathe, be sensitive and try to maintain their dignity. You may feel awkward and embarrassed, especially at first. To make bathing and washing as pleasant and comfortable as possible, you might consider: using pleasant-smelling shampoo, bubble bath or soap playing music the person you care for likes and is familiar with if the person you''re washing is confused, explaining what''s happening as you go along being sensitive to their mood Carer''s tip from Scope "If you are caring for someone who won''t wash, get involved with activities that are followed by showers – for example, swimming. It may help if they see other people showering. My son only started using the shower and wetting his head because he saw it in a film he was watching."  Maintaining dignity with hygiene Be aware of the emotional state of the person you care for when helping them wash. For example, some people can be anxious about deep bath water. Adaptations, such as seats or recliners, can help with anxiety. Reassure the person that you won''t let them be hurt. Overhead showers can be frightening to some people. If you have no bath or there is a good reason for using a shower rather than a bath, use a handheld shower. Ask the person how they would prefer to be helped and allow them as much independence as you think is safe. If they had a routine before you began caring for them, find out what it was and stick to it as much as you can. Find out which shampoo, shower gel or soap they prefer to make the experience more familiar to them. Many people become self-conscious when undressed in front of others. Be sensitive to the situation and approach it in the way you think is most appropriate. The person you care for may feel isolated if you leave them alone. How you handle this depends on your relationship with them. Have clothes and towels with you so you don''t have to leave them alone in the bathroom if they don''t want you to. Safety when washing or bathing If you or the person you''re looking after has limited mobility or problems balancing, make sure: the floor is not slippery (dry it if necessary)  the room is a comfortable temperature  the water is comfortably warm – older people particularly feel the cold, so bear this in mind when adjusting the temperature the locks are removed from the door – you or the person you care for may want privacy, but other people may need access in an emergency If you are caring for someone, protect your own safety – for example, by getting advice on helping someone get in and out of the bath. See more on moving and handling. Going to the toilet Going to the toilet (toileting) is an important part of personal hygiene, regardless of whether you or the person you''re looking after is able to control their bladder and bowels (continent) or not. Incontinence can create feelings of shame or embarrassment for both the carer and the person being cared for. Sometimes people may be in denial about their incontinence or refuse to accept help. Reassure them it''s not their fault and approach the issue in a calm, reassuring way. Giving a bed bath If the person you care for cannot move or has extremely limited mobility, you may need to give them a bed bath. You will need to be extra careful when moving or handling them. Specialist disposable baths are available for people who need a bath where you are put fully in the water. Getting help with hygiene If you''re finding it difficult to cope with your own or someone else''s toileting, washing or general hygiene, contact your local authority, a local carers'' organisation, or call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053. The Alzheimer''s Society has more tips on helping someone to wash. Continence services As many as one in three people have difficulty controlling their flow of urine. And while you may not have a problem controlling your bowel or bladder, a mobility problem can make successfully visiting the toilet difficult. Continence problems can cause physical problems such as skin irritation and infection, as well as embarrassment and loss of confidence. Your GP can advise you on NHS services that may help with your continence. They can provide support, advice and information, and may refer you to continence advisers or specialists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and dietitians. A continence adviser may be able to provide many small items and other equipment that can help with continence, including: plastic or PVC covers to protect beds disposable or washable continence pads waterproof pants Your social services department should be able to provide small aids and adaptations for the home, including: hand rails commodes raised toilet seats You can also buy continence equipment for yourself. The Bladder and Bowel Foundation provides an independent directory of incontinence products. Laundry services Some social services departments provide a laundry service for people who have incontinence or bowel and bladder problems. In addition, some local authorities provide laundry services for those who find it difficult to manage their laundry because it is too physically demanding. You will need to ask your social services department if they provide this service. Your local authority will usually carry out an assessment of your situation to work out what is the best service for you. Some local authorities make a small charge for their laundry service or only launder large items such as bedding.

This timetable has been worked out to give children the best chance of developing immunity against common, but potentially deadly, diseases. When to start childhood vaccinations Routine childhood vaccinations start when a baby is eight weeks old. This is a good age to start vaccinations, because the natural immunity to illness that newborn babies get from their mother is beginning to wear off. If a vaccine is given before eight weeks of age, the baby’s natural immunity to disease may stop it from working. That''s why you should ideally have your child vaccinated at the recommended time. Any delay can leave your baby unprotected against illnesses that are often more common and worse in younger children. Vaccinations for premature babies Babies who are born early can have a greater risk of catching infections than babies born on time. This is because their immune systems are less developed and they don’t receive as much natural immunity from their mothers. It’s especially important that premature babies get their vaccines on time, from eight weeks after birth, no matter how premature they are. It may seem very early to give a vaccination to such a tiny baby, but many scientific studies have shown that it’s a good time to give them vaccines. Postponing vaccination until they''re older leaves them vulnerable to diseases. If your baby was born very prematurely (before 26 weeks of pregnancy), they may still be in hospital when their first vaccinations are due. In this case, your baby will receive their first vaccines in hospital. Read this NHS leaflet on vaccinations for premature babies (PDF, 221kb). Booster jabs Some vaccines are given more than once. A gap is left between these vaccine doses to make sure that each one has time to work properly. However, the recommended gap is only a minimum. If the gap is longer – because you missed an appointment, for example – you don’t have to start the course again. Vaccination timings The NHS childhood vaccination schedule tells you when each routine vaccination should be given. It normally starts when your baby is eight weeks old and is completed by the time they''re 18. Other non-routine vaccines may be needed throughout childhood, such as travel vaccines or vaccines for children with certain medical conditions.

If they already get DLA or AA, make a claim now. You can make a claim by calling the Carer''s Allowance Unit on 0345 608 4321, or by claiming Carer''s Allowance online. However, if the person you look after is living alone and receives a means-tested benefit, your claim for Carer''s Allowance may affect their means-tested benefits. You can still make the claim for Carer''s Allowance, but should think carefully about the implications before you do. Getting Carer''s Allowance can mean you''re entitled to, or can get more, top-up benefits. For more information on what benefits you''re entitled to, try the entitledto benefits calculator. Read on, or click on the links below for more information: Backdating Carer''s Allowance claims Delays in receiving Carer''s Allowance How your changing circumstances may affect a Carer''s Allowance claim Backdating Carer''s Allowance claims Carer''s Allowance can usually only be backdated for a maximum of three months if you claim it within three months of a decision to award a qualifying benefit to the person you care for. You must specifically request that your Carer''s Allowance claim is backdated, and you must have satisfied all the rules for claiming Carer''s Allowance during the backdating period. You can also challenge a decision not to backdate Carer''s Allowance if your request is refused. Delays in receiving Carer''s Allowance Carer''s Allowance is paid into a bank or building society account either weekly in advance or every four weeks. If you don''t receive your benefit payment when you would normally expect it, contact the Carer''s Allowance Unit to find out whether payment has been lost, delayed or suspended. You can make a complaint about a delay you experience. You can also ask for an interim payment of benefit, which you''ll get if the DWP believes you''re entitled to some benefit but it''s not possible for the claim to be dealt with immediately. If you''re allowed an interim payment, the amount will be deducted from any later benefit payments. If you''re refused an interim payment, you can''t appeal to a tribunal, but you may be able to apply for judicial review of the decision.  Compensation for delay You can ask for a discretionary payment if you lose money because of a delay in payment of benefit. This might cover the cost of telephone calls or stamps, for example. You may be entitled to compensation if the DWP causes a significant delay and the arrears of benefit are £100 or more and the compensation would be at least £10. You can ask for a payment that covers the benefit you have lost, as well as an additional amount to cover interest on the arrears. Compensation payments are discretionary, so, if it applies, you should emphasise that the delay was caused by error or negligence on the part of the DWP. If you''re refused compensation, you could consider asking your MP to take up your case. You can also ask for a "consolatory" payment if you feel the delays or errors have caused you gross inconvenience, the DWP has embarrassed or humiliated you, or the distress the DWP has caused has affected your physical or mental health. Suspended payments of Carer''s Allowance Benefit payments can be suspended if you haven''t provided further information to the DWP when asked, if it is still making a decision, or if it is investigating an overpayment. If your benefit has been suspended, you could explain to the DWP that the suspension will cause hardship and ask for an interim benefit payment. If the DWP is still waiting for information, ask what''s missing and try to provide this information. There is no appeals procedure against the decision to suspend benefits. However, in extreme cases you may be able to get legal help to challenge the decision in court. How changing circumstances affect Carer''s Allowance If your circumstances change, you will need to let the Carer''s Allowance Unit know as it may affect your entitlement to Carer''s Allowance. It''s best to put any changes in writing as soon as possible after the change has happened. Examples of changed circumstances include, for example, that you are no longer spending at least 35 hours a week caring for the person, if you take a paid job, or your earnings increase. If your circumstances change in such a way that you may no longer be entitled to the benefit, report the change as quickly as possible. You must report the change either online at GOV.UK or to the Carer''s Allowance Unit. Call 0345 608 4321 (textphone 0345 604 5312) or write to Palatine House, Lancaster Road, Preston, PR1 1HB. If you don''t act quickly, you may be overpaid benefit and have to pay it back. Your Carer''s Allowance can stop if either you or the person you''re looking after goes into hospital or a care home for NHS- or local authority-funded care. You should notify the Carer''s Allowance Unit, as well as the disability benefit centre of the person you look after, of the dates either you or they spend in hospital or a care home.  If you go into hospital Your Carer''s Allowance will continue to be paid if you go on holiday for up to four weeks in any 26-week period, or up to 12 weeks if you go into hospital. However, Carer''s Allowance may stop sooner if you have already been on a holiday and then need to go to hospital. For more information, see Going into hospital or the Age UK leaflet on going into hospital (PDF, 2Mb). If the person you''re looking after goes into hospital or a care home If the person you look after goes into a hospital or care home, it can affect their PIP, DLA or AA claim as well as your Carer''s Allowance. In most cases the DLA care component, PIP or AA will stop after the person you''re looking after has been in hospital or a care home for 28 days, and that''s when Carer''s Allowance will also stop. If the person you''re looking after has been in hospital for less than 28 days, is discharged and then returns to hospital within 28 days of leaving, the two periods they''re in hospital are added together and treated as one period. If the person you''re looking after goes into hospital and their PIP, DLA or AA has not stopped, you''ll continue receiving Carer''s Allowance for up to 12 weeks while they''re in hospital. During these 12 weeks, you don''t have to provide any care. After these 12 weeks, you will have to show that you''re still providing 35 hours of care each week for your Carer''s Allowance to continue. Similar rules apply if the person you look after goes into a care home, but Carer''s Allowance will only be paid for up to four weeks for a care home stay.

It can cause severe illness and even death among vulnerable groups including older people, pregnant women and people with an underlying health condition. Certain people are more likely to develop potentially serious complications of flu, such as bronchitis and pneumonia. These people are advised to have a flu jab each year. For otherwise healthy people, flu can be very unpleasant. Most people will recover from flu within a week or two. People who should have a flu jab The injected flu vaccine is offered free of charge on the NHS to people who are at risk. This is to ensure they are protected against catching flu and developing serious complications. You are eligible to receive a free flu jab if you:  are 65 years of age or over    are pregnant  have certain medical conditions  are living in a long-stay residential care home or other long-stay care facility  receive a carer''s allowance, or you are the main carer for an elderly or disabled person whose welfare may be at risk if you fall ill  Front-line health and social care workers are also eligible to receive the flu vaccine.  It is your employer''s responsibility to arrange and pay for this vaccine.  65s and over and the flu jab You are eligible for the flu vaccine this year (2016-17) if you are aged 65 and over on March 31 2017 – that is, you were born on or before March 31 1952. So, if you are currently 64 but will be 65 on March 31 2017, you do qualify. Pregnant women and the flu jab If you''re pregnant, you''re advised to have the injectable flu vaccine, regardless of the stage of pregnancy you''ve reached. That''s because there''s strong evidence to suggest pregnant women have an increased risk of developing complications if they get flu. If you''re pregnant, you will benefit from the flu vaccine because: it reduces your chance of getting serious complications of flu, such as pneumonia, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy it reduces your risk of having a miscarriage, or your baby being born prematurely or with a low birth weight because of the flu it will help protect your baby as they will continue to have some immunity to flu for the first few months of their life It''s safe to have the flu vaccine at any stage of pregnancy from conception onwards. The vaccine doesn''t carry any risks for you or your baby. Talk to your GP, midwife or pharmacist if you want more information. Read more about the flu jab in pregnancy. Flu jab for people with medical conditions The injected flu vaccine is offered free of charge on the NHS to anyone with a serious long-term health condition. That includes these types of illnesses:   chronic (long-term) respiratory diseases, such as asthma (which requires an inhaled or tablet steroid treatment, or has led to hospital admission in the past), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or bronchitis  chronic heart disease, such as heart failure  chronic kidney disease  chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis  chronic neurological conditions, such as Parkinson''s disease or motor neurone disease  diabetes problems with your spleen – for example, sickle cell disease or if you have had your spleen removed  a weakened immune system as the result of conditions such as HIV and AIDS, or medication such as steroid tablets or chemotherapy This list of conditions isn''t definitive. It''s always an issue of clinical judgement. Your GP can assess you individually to take into account the risk of flu exacerbating any underlying illness you may have, as well as your risk of serious illness from flu itself. The vaccine should always be offered in such cases, even if you are not technically in one of the risk groups above. If you live with someone who has a weakened immune system, you may also be advised to have a flu vaccine. Speak to your GP or pharmacist about this. Flu vaccine for children The flu vaccine is free on the NHS for: children over the age of six months with a long-term health condition children aged two, three and four on 31 August 2016 - that is, born between 1 September 2011 and 31 August 2014 children in school years one, two and three. Children aged between six months and two years of age who are eligible for the flu vaccine should have the flu jab. Children eligible for the flu vaccine aged between two and 17 will usually have the flu vaccine nasal spray. Flu jab for health and social care workers Outbreaks of flu can occur in health and social care settings, and, because flu is so contagious, staff, patients and residents are all at risk of infection. If you''re a front-line health and social care worker, you are eligible for an NHS flu jab to protect yourself, your colleagues and other members of the community. It is your employer''s responsibility to arrange vaccination for you. So, if you are an NHS-employed front-line healthcare worker, the NHS will pay for your vaccination. If you are a social care worker, your employer should pay for vaccination. In the case of health and social care workers employed by private companies, those companies will arrange and pay for the vaccinations. The NHS has this advice on flu vaccination of health and social care workers (PDF, 131kb)  . Flu jab for carers If you care for someone who is elderly or disabled, speak to your GP or pharmacist about having a flu jab along with the person you care for.

Someone with a dissociative disorder may have memory loss or may feel: that their body or the world around them is unreal uncertain about who they are that they have many different identities Most people affected by this disorder will have experienced a traumatic event during childhood. They ''dissociate'', or switch off from reality, to cope with it (the box on this page explains what ''dissociation'' means). This feeling of being disconnected from yourself or from the world can be extremely distressing, significantly affecting work and personal life. It can affect people at any age and is nothing to do with a head injury or underlying health condition – it''s the result of the brain adapting to a difficult early life. If you have been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder, or a friend or family member has, read on. This page explains three main types of dissociative disorders: dissociative amnesia depersonalisation-derealisation disorder  dissociative identity disorder It then explains what we know about the cause of dissociative disorders, other conditions commonly associated with dissociative disorders, and how dissociative disorders are treated. What is dissociative amnesia? Someone with dissociative amnesia will repeatedly have periods where they cannot remember information about themselves or about events in their past life. They may also forget a learnt talent or skill. These gaps in memory are much more severe than normal forgetfulness, and are not the result of an underlying medical condition. Some people with dissociative amnesia will find themselves in a strange place without knowing how they got there. They may have travelled there purposefully, or wandered in a confused state. These blank episodes may last minutes, hours or days – and rarely, months or years. What is depersonalisation-derealisation disorder? ''Depersonalisation'' means feeling detached from yourself, observing yourself and your feelings and thoughts as if they belong to someone else you are watching in a movie. Some of the typical symptoms are: out-of-body experiences loss of feeling in parts of your body distorted views of your body unable to recognise your image in a mirror a sense of detachment from your emotions feeling like you are watching a movie of yourself feeling like you are unreal ''Derealisation'' means seeing other people and the environment around you as dream-like and unreal. Objects may change in shape, size or colour. Typical symptoms are: feeling like a normal environment is unfamiliar a sense that what is happening is unreal feeling detached from the world a perception of objects changing shape, colour, size feeling that people you know are strangers You might experience one or both of these problems if you have been diagnosed with depersonalisation-derealisation disorder, and will probably be aware that these experiences aren''t reality. Episodes of depersonalisation or derealisation may last just a few moments and come and go over many years, or may be ongoing. What is dissociative identity disorder? Dissociative identity disorder, or ''multiple personality disorder'', is the most extreme of the three types. If you''ve been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, you may feel uncertain about who you are and struggle to define yourself. You may feel the presence of other identities, which may each have their own names, voices, personal histories and mannerisms. Typical symptoms are: feeling like a stranger to yourself being confused about your sexuality or gender feeling like there are different people within you referring to yourself as ''we'' behaving out of character writing in different handwriting What''s the cause? Many people with a dissociative disorder will have experienced a traumatic event in the past. Often, this traumatic event will have been physical, sexual or emotional abuse suffered during childhood, although some people ''dissociate'' after experiencing war, kidnapping or even an invasive medical procedure. Switching off from reality is a normal defence mechanism that helps the person to cope during a traumatic time – it''s a form of denial, as if "this isn''t happening to me". It becomes dysfunctional when the environment is no longer traumatic but the person still acts and lives as if it is, and hasn''t dealt with or processed the event. So, a dissociative disorder is the result of the brain adapting to a difficult early life environment. It is not: to do with genes the result of another medical condition the result of a head injury the result of drug or alcohol abuse (although many people with dissociative disorders misuse alcohol or drugs to cope) What are the some of the associated conditions? Someone with a dissociative disorder may also suffer from: post-traumatic stress disorder  depression  mood swings anxiety and panic attacks suicidal tendencies and/or self-harm headaches hearing voices  sleep disorders phobias  an eating disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder  How are dissociative disorders treated? If you have been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder, a mental health specialist will want to ask you more questions about how you are feeling and find out whether you suffered any trauma in the past. It''s important to be honest about your symptoms, and not feel ashamed or embarrassed, so you can receive the help and support you need. Some people with dissociative disorders will benefit from a course of psychotherapy or counselling. This talking therapy aims to help you cope with the underlying cause of your symptoms, and helps you to manage the periods of feeling disconnected. Read more about how psychotherapy works. If you have suffered a traumatic event in the past, you might benefit from a technique called eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). EMDR has been found to reduce the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. It involves making side-to-side eye movements, usually by following the movement of the therapist''s finger, while recalling the traumatic incident. It is not clear exactly how EMDR works, but it may help the malfunctioning part of the brain to process distressing memories and flashbacks so that they have less influence over your mind. Read more about EMDR. There is no medication to specifically treat dissociation, although medication may be prescribed to treat any depression, anxiety and insomnia. Read about the: treatment of depression treatment of anxiety treatment of insomnia Many people make a full recovery with treatment and support.

''Dissociation'' means a period when we feel disconnected from the environment and/or from ourselves. We all have these moments of disconnection from time to time – daydreaming while driving, or switching off and missing part of a conversation, for example. These moments of ''not being with it'' normally pass quickly. Someone with a dissociative disorder has persistent, repeated episodes of dissociation that are extreme enough to severely affect everyday life.

Common side effects of the rotavirus vaccine Babies who have the vaccine can sometimes become restless and irritable, and some may develop mild diarrhoea. Rare side effects of the rotavirus vaccine Allergic reaction: As with all vaccines, there is a very rare (approximately one in a million) possibility of the rotavirus vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is very serious and a medical emergency, but with prompt treatment most people make a full recovery. All health professionals responsible for giving vaccines should be trained to recognise and treat anaphylaxis. Blocked intestine: In very rare cases (about two in every hundred thousand babies vaccinated), the rotavirus vaccine can affect the baby’s lower gut, and they may develop a rare gut disorder called intussusception, which causes a blockage in the intestine. The symptoms of intussusception are tummy ache, vomiting and sometimes passing what looks like redcurrant jelly in their nappy. If this happens, contact your doctor immediately. What to do if your baby is unwell after the rotavirus vaccine As with all vaccines, a few infants will have side effects, such as diarrhoea, though in general these are mild and short-lived. The vast majority of babies won’t have any problems at all. Also bear in mind that diarrhoea and vomiting in babies is common and is generally not related to the vaccine. A baby can get rotavirus infection after being vaccinated – but it is usually milder than it would have been if they hadn’t been vaccinated. They can also get a positive rotavirus test after being vaccinated, but this does not usually last for very long – your doctor will not be able to tell whether the positive test is due to the vaccine or the natural infection. If your baby is very unwell and/or the illness is going on a long time, or you''re concerned in any way about their health following vaccination, please see your doctor. Read more about vaccine side effects in babies This NHS leaflet tells you the common vaccination reactions in babies and young children up to five years old (PDF, 118kb). How to report a vaccine side effect The Yellow Card Scheme allows you to report suspected side effects from a vaccine. It''s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Find out how to report a vaccine side effect.

The Care Act and what it means for me Media last reviewed: 30/09/2015 Next review due: 30/09/2017 Your carer''s assessment may identify that you need a break from caring from time to time. Equally, the person you care for may also want to have a break without you. See Accessible day trips and activities for help planning their trip. Replacement care and respite care Replacement care is designed to replace the care that you, as a carer, would normally be giving the person you care for. It may be needed so you can look after your own health and wellbeing, and to take a break from caring. For example, it may be that regular replacement overnight care is needed so you can catch up on your own sleep. In certain situations, respite (temporary) care may be provided by your local authority after your carer''s assessment or after the person you care for has had an assessment. You can use the directory of local carers'' services to find your nearest local carers'' centre or respite service. Your local authority or local carers'' centre can give you information about local support. Carer''s tip from Scope "Some hospices provide respite care; we have found this very helpful. They offer high-level care, which means you can feel comfortable your family member is being cared for properly." Breaks for carers After your carer''s assessment, you may agree with your local authority that you need a break as part of your support plan. If the local authority has agreed to fund the breaks in your care plan, you should be able to choose how you can get your break. Using direct payments to get time off caring After your assessment, if you are eligible for support, your local authority will develop a support plan with you. This will include a personal budget, which you can choose to have as a direct payment. For example, you may choose to:  hire a care worker through an agency so you can go on a shopping trip use the direct payment to pay for a supported holiday for both you and the person you care for – the Short Breaks Network can provide more information on this Alternatives to direct payments You may also want to consider funding or getting a break from caring by: asking for care organised by your local authority getting funding from a benevolent fund or charity paying for a break yourself accessing bursaries and low-cost holidays getting leisure discounts asking friends and family to help Replacement care provided by the local authority Instead of a direct payment, you could ask the local authority to arrange services for you so you can have a break. You can also use a direct payment to fund traditional forms of respite care, and you can pool your direct payments with other people''s to fund services such as day centres. Some local authorities provide vouchers (sometimes called respite grants, or carers'' grants) that can be exchanged for services, such as those offered by care agencies or residential homes. You might be able to use vouchers to pay for extra costs associated with your holiday, including live-in care workers, short-stay residential care, or the cost of more homecare. You might want to consider: homecare services – these can either be day services that give you the chance to do an activity inside or outside the home, or night services that can help you get a proper night''s sleep, or helpers coming to the home of the person you''re caring for. Different types of help can be organised, including sitting with the person you care for and keeping them company, preparing meals, and helping them to get up, washed and dressed. The care workers who come to your home can also provide social activities, such as taking the person you care for to the cinema, pub or shopping. residential or nursing care – this is where the person you''re looking after goes for a short stay in a residential or nursing home. If you can, visit the care or nursing home beforehand so you can see what it''s like.  day care – this is where the person you''re looking after goes to a day centre or takes part in activities away from home. If the replacement care provided is essentially a homecare service for the person needing care and allows you to take a break, it should be considered a service provided to the cared-for person and should therefore be charged to them, not you as the carer. Find out more in Carer''s assessment. Benevolent funds or charity funding You may be able to get help with the cost of going on holiday – either alone or with the person you care for – from a charity or benevolent fund. Your social worker, GP, health visitor or local carers'' support group can give you more information on local benevolent funds and other possible sources of funding. You might find help from the following: Saga Respite for Carers Trust provides a limited number of free holidays each year for carers over the age of 50 and the people they look after. The Family Fund can provide grants towards the cost of holidays for families on a low income who are caring for a child with a severe disability. The Family Holiday Association is a UK charity providing breaks at holiday sites, or grants to help with the cost of a holiday, to low-income families in need of a holiday away from home. You need to be referred by your social worker, GP or health visitor, or by a charity or other welfare agent. The Children''s Country Holiday Fund provides respite breaks in the countryside for young carers aged 6 to 16 and disadvantaged children and young people. Paying for your own breaks If after a carer''s assessment the local authority decides it will not fund a break for you, you can still decide to pay for your own break from caring. How you go about this will depend on your budget and the care options available to you locally. Bursaries and low-cost holidays Some charities offer low-cost holidays or bursaries to families. The national charity Diabetes UK offers support holidays for families and young people. Holidays are low cost and a bursary can be offered to families who can''t afford the travel costs to the UK holiday site. Further information can be found on the Diabetes UK website or on 020 7424 1000 (ask for the care support team). Turn2us, an independent charity, can help you find sources of financial support based on your particular needs and circumstances. Saga, the organisation for people aged 50 and older, has a range of holidays and short breaks to suit carers, including group holidays, holidays for single travellers, special interest holidays, and cruises. Holidays are run throughout the year in the UK and abroad. Saga also offers free holidays for carers through the Saga Respite for Carers Trust. Leisure discounts Many local authorities offer leisure cards. These can help you pay for activities you might like to do when you get a break from caring. They''re often available to people claiming benefits such as Income Support, Employment and Support Allowance, Carer''s Allowance and benefits for disabled people, students over 18 in full-time education, and people over 60. The eligibility requirements vary between areas, but there''s a good chance you''ll qualify if you''re a carer with a low income. Local authorities might make a small annual charge for the card, from £1 up to around £15. You''ll probably be asked for some proof of your entitlement, such as a statement of entitlement for Income Support or an official letter. Discount leisure cards can give you discounts of between 10 and 50% on activities, services and entertainment. These range from sporting activities at local leisure centres to cinemas, theatres, libraries, museums, hairdressers and beauty salons. Help with caring from friends and family Friends and family can provide support for you and the person you care for, especially when you need a break from caring. However, they are not the same as paid professional care workers, and regular caring can place the same stresses on them as on you. They may also be unable or unwilling to commit to giving you a break when you need it. Make sure anyone who takes over from you has all the information they need to look after the person you care for. This may include what they like to eat and at what time, as well as more complex information about the medicines they need to take. Leave a clear list of contacts. These should include the doctor''s number, those of nearby family members and friends, and your own number in case of emergencies. If you have an emergency plan, go through it with the people who will be providing replacement care. If the person you care for needs specialist medical or nursing help while you''re away, arrange this through their GP. This specialist help can include visits from a district nurse or from a community psychiatric nurse. There is no charge for this healthcare, but each NHS body decides what care it will provide. Help with emergency planning Thinking about what you would do in an emergency should be part of the discussion you have as part of your carer''s assessment. The person who carries out your assessment should be able to help you with planning. Carer''s tip from Scope "It might be a good idea to choose someone from your family to be the person''s guardian in case of death. You should ensure that person is familiar, and keep them up-to-date with needs." To create an emergency plan, you will need to note down details of: the name, address and any other contact details of the person you look after who you and the person you look after would like to be contacted in an emergency – this could be friends, family or professional people involved in the person''s care any medication the person is taking any ongoing treatment they need You can register with a carers emergency scheme in your area. If you do, a skilled worker trained to look at your individual situation may be able to help you make your emergency plans. Who can help make an emergency plan? Every carer who has an assessment should be asked about emergencies and offered help to plan for them. The social worker involved in your carer''s assessment should be able to help you with emergency planning.

Does this affect children with allergies?  Does the rotavirus vaccine contain thiomersal?  What if my baby is ill on the day the vaccination is due?  How long will the rotavirus vaccination protect my baby for?  Can I opt out if I wish?  Is it ok to breastfeed my baby after the vaccination?  Do I need to take special care when changing my baby''s nappy after rotavirus vaccination?  Will the rotavirus vaccination stop my baby getting any sickness and diarrhoea?  My baby was premature. When should they have the rotavirus vaccine?  How is rotavirus spread? Rotavirus is spread in faeces (poo) through hand-to-mouth contact and can be picked up from surfaces such as toys, hands or dirty nappies. It can also be spread through the air by sneezing and coughing. It’s most often spread when someone who is infected does not wash their hands properly after going to the toilet. Washing hands and keeping surfaces clean can help to reduce the spread of the virus, but will never completely stop it. Vaccination is a much more effective way of protecting babies from getting infected. How is the rotavirus vaccine given? Rotavirus vaccine is given as a liquid from a dropper straight into the baby’s mouth. What if my baby spits out the vaccine or vomits immediately after having it? The drops will be given again. Don’t worry about overdosing. Even if some of the vaccine went in first time, there’s no harm in mistakenly having two doses at the same time. When will the rotavirus vaccine be given to babies? The first dose will be given at two months, and the second dose at three months. What if my baby misses the first dose of rotavirus vaccine? They can have it a month later, at three months old. If they miss the second dose of rotavirus vaccine (normally given at three months), they can have that a month later, at four months old. Why can’t older babies have the rotavirus vaccination? Older children have very often already had a rotavirus infection, so there is no point in vaccinating them. Also, as they get older, some babies – about one in a thousand – get a condition that causes a blockage in their lower gut, called intussusception. It’s extremely rare before three months of age, and most cases happen between five months and a year old. There’s a very small chance (around two in every hundred thousand babies vaccinated) that the first dose of the vaccine might also cause this blockage to develop. To reduce the risk of this happening, the first dose of the vaccine won’t be given to babies older than 15 weeks of age. Which babies shouldn’t have the rotavirus vaccine? Your baby shouldn’t have the vaccine if they have had a confirmed anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of rotavirus vaccine or any of its ingredients. The vaccine shouldn''t be given if your baby has any of the following long-term conditions: • a history of intussusception (a disorder of the intestines) • severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) disorder – a rare genetic disease that makes babies very vulnerable to infection • fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency – which are all rare inherited disorders Is the rotavirus vaccine made in eggs? Does this affect children with allergies? This vaccine is not made in eggs and should be perfectly safe for babies with general allergies, although any baby with a history of allergy to the vaccine or constituents of the vaccine should not be vaccinated. Does the rotavirus vaccine contain thiomersal? No. Thiomersal is a mercury-based substance that used to be commonly included as a preservative in vaccines, but which has been eliminated from all routine childhood vaccinations. Read more about vaccine ingredients. What if my baby is ill on the day the vaccination is due? There’s no reason to postpone the appointment, unless your baby is seriously ill with a fever or diarrhoea and vomiting. If your baby is well enough to have the other routine vaccinations, they can have the rotavirus vaccine. Here are the top vaccination tips for parents. How long will the rotavirus vaccine protect my baby for? We don''t know for sure, but clinical trials have shown that two doses of the vaccine protect for several years. Can I opt out if I wish? Yes. No one can force you to have your baby vaccinated against rotavirus infection, but the evidence suggests that it’s in the best interests of your child. Read more about this and the other top questions that parents have about baby vaccinations. Is it ok to breastfeed my baby after the vaccination? Yes. There are no problems linked with breastfeeding babies who have recently had the rotavirus vaccine. Do I need to take special care when changing my baby’s nappy after rotavirus vaccination? Yes. Because the vaccine is given to your baby by mouth, it’s possible that the virus in the vaccine will pass through your baby’s gut and be picked up by whoever changes their nappy. The vaccine contains only a weakened form of the rotavirus, so traces of it in a baby’s nappy won’t harm healthy people. However, it could pose a risk for people with a weak immune system (such as anyone taking long-term steroid tablets or having chemotherapy). As a precaution, anyone in close contact with recently vaccinated babies should take special care with personal hygiene, including washing their hands carefully after changing the baby’s nappy. Will the rotavirus vaccine stop my baby getting any sickness and diarrhoea? No. Rotavirus isn’t the only cause of sickness and diarrhoea in babies, so some may still get unwell. However, the vaccine will stop about 8 out of 10 babies that have the vaccine getting vomiting caused by rotavirus. The more babies that have the vaccine, the more difficult it will be for the virus to spread. My baby was premature. When should they have the rotavirus vaccine? As with all vaccinations, the schedule should be followed from the actual date of birth, not from the date your baby was due. Therefore, your baby should have the rotavirus vaccine at two months and three months old, no matter how premature they were. Read about vaccinations for premature babies.

Supported Living Media last reviewed: 30/09/2015 Next review due: 30/09/2017 Until the age of 18, the care of children with long-term health conditions is the responsibility of child health and social care services. From 18, they are usually the responsibility of adult services. Between the ages of 16 and 18, the child will start a “transition” of the services affecting: health and social care  mental health education financial benefits for the young person and their family work housing Planning for this transition should begin when a child is in Year 9 at school (13 or 14 years old) at the latest. Transition should be an ongoing process rather than a single event and should be tailored to suit the child’s needs. The local authority may also combine a transition assessment with any other assessment being carried out (provided everyone agrees). For example, if a hospital is carrying out an assessment, the local authority can carry it out jointly with them. Transition assessments could also potentially become part of a young person’s education, health and care plan. Assessing needs If a child, young carer or an adult caring for a child (a ‘child’s carer’) is likely to have needs when they, or the child they care for, turn 18, the local authority must assess them if it considers there is ‘significant benefit’ to the individual. The local authority has a duty to do this even if the person hasn’t asked to be assessed or already receives any services. This will help the young person to understand whether they (and their carer, where relevant), are likely to be eligible for care and support when they turn 18, and what might be available to them. When either a child or a young carer approaches their 18th birthday, they may ask their local authority for an assessment. A parent or carer may also ask for an assessment as the child they are caring for approaches 18 because the child’s situation will potentially be changing dramatically, which means the carer’s needs may change too. This right applies to everyone, whether or not they are currently receiving services. The assessment should provide advice and information about what can be done to meet or reduce the person’s needs, as well as what they can do to stay well, and prevent or delay the development of needs. It will help you or the person you care for to plan ahead. There is no set age that you have to be assessed at, as the best time to plan the move to adult services will be different for each person. What if I can’t get an assessment? If a local authority denies a request to carry out an assessment, it must explain in writing why it has reached that decision. Find out more about assessments and eligibility. The local authority must also still provide information and advice about what you or the person you care for can do to prevent or delay the development of care and support needs. What will happen to my child’s existing care and support services while they’re being assessed? A child or young carer receiving children’s services will continue to receive them during the assessment process either until the adult care and support is in place to take over or until it is clear after the assessment that adult care and support does not need to be provided. Health and social care Transition from child health services to adult health services will mean your child may start seeing a different team at your local hospital or health and social services department. There should be a detailed exchange of information between the two teams before this takes place. Your child should not be discharged from children''s health services until their care has been transferred to adult health services. Mental health The age children and young people move to another service can differ depending on where you live. For example, some transition at 16, others at 18 or older. Transition between services can be a scary time for young people as the teams they know and are used to working with change. It’s important everyone involved understands the process and feels supported and prepared to try to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible. Your Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) team should work closely with you to support the transition. For example, you could have a joint meeting with your current team and the new adult mental health services. For more information, see Mental health services available. Emotional support and advice for young people and parents is available from the charity Young Minds. Transitional planning and education At age 16, and beyond, young people will often become increasingly independent and may want to exercise more control over the support they receive for their special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). Colleges, your local authority and others who provide services for young people when they are over compulsory school age are expected to communicate directly with the young person. You should talk to your son or daughter and agree how best you can be involved and how much support they will need as they get older. Once you have agreed arrangements which work for you, your son or daughter should let their college know so that you can receive the information and support you need as a parent to continue to give your child the support that they need from you. If a college can’t meet a young person’s needs because they require specialist help, then a young person, with support from their parents, should consider whether they need an Education, Health and Care (EHC) needs assessment, which might lead to an EHC plan. EHCs offer families personal budgets so that they have more control over the type of support they get. If you think your son or daughter needs an assessment, you should both discuss this with the college. A request can be made for an EHC plan up until a young person reaches the age of 25. Benefits for the young person and their family As a parent carer you can claim benefits on behalf of your child until they reach the age of 16. From the September after your child’s 16th birthday, you will only be able to get payments for them as a dependent if they are in full-time education or on an approved training course. Once your child reaches 16 they may be able to claim certain benefits in their own right. This could have an impact on your household income, because certain benefits will reduce if your child is no longer classed as a dependent. For information on how your benefits might be affected, contact a specialist benefits advisor; for example at a Citizens Advice Bureau. In some cases young people with disabilities will not be able to manage their own benefit payments and will need an appointee (usually their parent or carer) to help them. Disability Living Allowance If you are a parent or carer of a child with a disability, you can claim Disability Living Allowance for your child until they turn 16. Personal Independence Payment (PIP) is the new benefit that has replaced Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for working-age adults (aged 16-64) with a disability. As with DLA, PIP is designed to help you meet some of the extra costs you may have because of a long-term health condition or disability. This means once a disabled person turns 16 and wants to claim a disability benefit, they will need to apply for PIP. Transitioning from school into work If your child decides to move into work, they might want advice and guidance. They can get specialist advice about work and disability through a Disability Employment Adviser at their local Jobcentre Plus office. This adviser can help with assessments, work plans and advise on schemes such as Access to work and Workchoice. Find more about disability and the workplace. Supported housing If a young person is thinking of moving away from home, they might want to consider ‘supported housing’. Supported housing is available for people who are vulnerable or have a disability. It allows people to live independently and still receive the care that they need. The care offered in supported housing can range from onsite support to occasional visits, and can be offered for a few hours a week or up to 24 hours a day depending on the person’s needs. Sheltered housing is available for physically disabled people, people with mental health problems, people with learning disabilities and older people. It’s a good idea to visit the supported housing scheme you’re interested in before applying so that you can speak to other residents and make sure that they can sufficiently tend to your child’s care needs. To find out more about housing options in your area, speak to your local authority. Page last reviewed: 15/01/2015 Next review due: 15/01/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

In the past 50 years, it''s saved more lives worldwide than any other medical product or procedure. However, the fascinating story of vaccination goes back all the way to Ancient Greece. 429 BC: Thucydides notices that people who survive smallpox do not get reinfected As long ago as 429 BC, the Greek historian Thucydides observed that those who survived the smallpox plague in Athens did not become reinfected with the disease. 900 AD: Chinese discover variolation The Chinese were the first to discover and use a primitive form of vaccination called variolation. It was carried out as early as the 10th century, and particularly between the 14th and 17th centuries. The aim was to prevent smallpox by exposing healthy people to tissue from the scabs caused by the disease. They did this by either putting it under the skin or, more often, inserting powdered scabs from smallpox pustules up the nose. 1700s: Variolation spreads around the world Variolation eventually spread to Turkey, and arrived in England in the early 18th century. At this time, smallpox was the most infectious disease in Europe. It struck rich and poor alike, and killed up to one-fifth of those infected in numerous epidemics. Variolation caused mild illness, but although it occasionally caused death, smallpox rates were lower in populations that tried it. 1796: Edward Jenner discovers vaccination British physician Dr Edward Jenner (pictured) discovered vaccination in its modern form and proved to the scientific community that it worked. 1803: Royal Jennerian Institute founded Support for vaccination grew. Jenner was awarded government funding, and in 1803 the Royal Jennerian Institute was founded. Vaccination became popular throughout Europe and, soon after, the US. 1870s: Violent opposition to vaccination Although vaccination was taken up enthusiastically by many, there was some violent opposition as it became more widespread. People found it hard to believe that it really worked. They also felt it took away people''s civil liberties, particularly when it was compulsory. 1880s: A vaccine against rabies Louis Pasteur improved vaccination even more and developed a rabies vaccine. As the science of immunology developed and scientists began to understand more about how diseases worked, other vaccines were created. 1890: Emil von Behring discovers the basis of diphtheria and tetanus vaccines German scientist Emil von Behring was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Japanese physician and bacteriologist Shibasaburo Kitasato discovered the antitoxins of diphtheria and tetanus. He demonstrated that animals injected with small amounts of the tetanus toxin became immune to the disease. 1920s: Vaccines become widely available By the end of the 1920s, vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and tuberculosis (TB) were all available. Vaccination spread across the globe – although these early vaccines were crude, they worked. The first vaccination programmes dramatically reduced the number of deaths from disease and were crucial in establishing the concept of preventative public health measures. 1955: Polio vaccination begins Polio vaccination was introduced in the UK, dramatically reducing the number of cases of the disease. Nowadays, polio is extremely rare and is close to being completely eliminated from the planet. 1956: WHO fights to eradicate smallpox The first attempt to use the smallpox vaccine on a global scale began when the World Health Organization (WHO) decided to try to eradicate smallpox across the world. 1980: Smallpox eradicated from the world Smallpox was declared as being eradicated in 1980. It was one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of medicine. 2008: Cervical cancer scientist awarded Nobel Prize Professor Harald zur Hausen discovered that cervical cancer was caused by a virus, making it possible to develop a vaccine for the disease. The scientist proved that a group of viruses called human papillomaviruses (HPV) caused cervical cancer. This discovery led to the development of the HPV vaccine, which protects against cervical cancer, and is now widely available. 2008: NHS vaccinates girls against cancer In England, the NHS cervical cancer vaccination programme began, whereby all girls aged 12 to 13 are offered HPV vaccination to protect them against cervical cancer. It is the first time that a routine universal vaccine has been given to prevent a type of cancer. 2013: NHS vaccinates against shingles, rotavirus and children''s flu The NHS vaccination programme saw the introduction of rotavirus vaccination for babies and a shingles vaccine for over-70s. A children''s flu vaccine was also launched. This is given as a nasal spray rather than an injection. 2015: NHS vaccinates babies against meningitis B The NHS vaccination programme saw the introduction of Men B vaccination for babies. The programme is the first national, routine, universal and publicly funded Men B vaccination programme in the world.

If you''re unhappy about the way your claim has been dealt with, you can also make a complaint. If you want more information about the reasons behind the decision, you need to ask for a "written statement of reasons" within one month of being sent the decision. If you''re sent written reasons within that month, you have an extra 14 days in which to ask for the decision to be reconsidered. In some cases, you may be able to get the decision looked at again even if the one-month deadline has expired. When your application for reconsideration has been decided, you will be sent a "mandatory reconsideration notice". This will explain about your right of appeal, should you still disagree with the decision. Gathering evidence to challenge an income-related benefit decision Before applying for a mandatory reconsideration, you should read the decision notice carefully. Look at the reasons behind the decision, as this will help you decide what kind of evidence might be available to support your case. If you''ve been refused a benefit because it''s thought that you have savings above the capital limit, you could use copies of your bank statements as evidence. Your income amount can be clarified by providing copies of your employment contract or pay slips, or a letter from your employer. In challenging a benefit claim decision, you may need advice on how best to do this. An advice worker may be able to: give you information about the rules for the benefit you''re claiming  advise you on tactics, deadlines and what evidence would be useful when challenging a benefit decision You may be able to argue your case based on common sense. However, there are sometimes complex legal reasons for your benefit being refused or being paid at a rate lower than you expected. It''s particularly important to get help if: you don''t fully understand the decision you don''t know how to argue against the reasons given for the decision   You may be able to get advice from:  your local Citizens Advice Bureau a local law centre a local authority welfare rights service – contact your local authority to see if there''s a welfare rights service in your area a firm of solicitors that specialises in welfare benefits a voluntary organisation, such as a carers centre your trade union, if you belong to one After you''ve applied for a mandatory reconsideration, you may be contacted by the Department for Work and Pensions to discuss the reasons for the dispute. This is your opportunity to find out more about why the decision was made, to clarify the evidence already provided and to tell them that you can provide more evidence if that is the case. Appealing a benefit decision The "mandatory reconsideration notice" will tell you how to appeal. Importantly, it will tell you that your appeal must be made directly to HM Courts and Tribunals Service and that you must also include a copy of your mandatory reconsideration notice. The Tribunals Service will send you an enquiry form, which asks whether you want an oral hearing or a paper hearing (where you don’t attend). You must return the enquiry form within 14 days. The appeal may not go ahead if the form is not returned in time. Before the hearing, you will be sent an explanation for the decision (known as a response), and this will also be sent to Tribunals Service. Paper hearing In a paper hearing, the tribunal looks at all of the information in the case papers and makes a decision based on that information. In an oral hearing, you appear in person and explain why you think the decision on the benefit you''ve claimed is wrong. The tribunal will ask you questions about the facts in your case. Oral hearing You stand a better chance of success if you go to an oral hearing. This is because most of us are better at explaining things by talking to other people than by putting things in writing. The tribunal will also be able to ask questions and may raise points that you didn''t know were relevant. The rules of the tribunal procedure aren''t very strict. The chairman or woman of the tribunal decides who speaks and when, but the chair must make sure that you get a fair chance to state your case. It helps to be prepared. Before the hearing, make notes of what you want to say. Lay out the main points you want to raise to explain why you think the decision is wrong. Be clear about what you think the correct decision should be, and set out what other evidence you may have that can support your case The decision is usually made on the same day, and you will be given a short notice informing you of the tribunal''s decision. If you believe there''s been an official error, you can ask for a decision to be reconsidered at any time. Complaints about income-related benefits claims If you''re unhappy about the way your benefit claim has been processed, or the way you were personally treated, you can make a complaint. If your complaint is about the service from the DWP: Contact the person who dealt with your claim, or that person’s manager. There''s no need to wait until a decision on the claim has been made. If you''re not satisfied, you could ask for the details of the district manager of that benefit office, and contact them with your complaint. If you''re still not satisfied, you could contact the chief executive of the DWP. The district manager will give you the contact details. If you''re still not happy, you could ask the independent case examiner to look at your complaint. This can be done particularly if the complaint involves failure to follow proper procedures, excessive delay or poor customer service. Contact the independent case examiner no later than six months after the final response received from the DWP. The independent case examiner can be reached on 0345 606 0777. At any stage, you can ask your MP to take up the complaint on your behalf. Your MP may agree to refer the matter to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. ''Overpayments'' of income-related benefits People are sometimes paid more benefit than they''re entitled to. An overpayment of benefit may be caused by an administrative error. An overpayment of benefit might also be caused by you making a mistake or contributing towards an error being made. For instance, you might fail to disclose important details, or you might have misrepresented an important fact. Sometimes, you will be asked to pay overpaid benefits back. Even if you didn’t deliberately mislead, an investigation may still examine whether you contributed to the error that caused the overpayment. You may want to get professional advice if this happens.

It usually starts during childhood and continues into adulthood. In many cases Tourette''s syndrome runs in families and it''s often associated with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Tourette’s syndrome is named after the French doctor, Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who first described the syndrome and its symptoms in the 19th century. Tics Tics can be: vocal (sounds) – such as grunting, coughing or shouting out words physical (movements) – such as jerking of the head or jumping up and down They can also be: simple – making a small movement or uttering a single sound complex – making a series of physical movements or speaking a long phrase Most people diagnosed with Tourette’s syndrome have a combination of physical and vocal tics, which can be both simple and complex. The tics don''t usually pose a serious threat to a person''s overall health, although physical tics, such as jerking of the head, can often be painful. However, children and adults with Tourette’s syndrome may experience associated problems, such as social isolation, embarrassment and low self-esteem. Read more about the signs and symptoms of Tourette’s syndrome. What causes Tourette''s syndrome? The cause of Tourette’s syndrome is unknown. However, it''s thought to be linked to problems with a part of the brain known as the basal ganglia, which helps regulate body movements. In people with Tourette’s syndrome, the basal ganglia ''misfire'', resulting in the characteristic tics. Read more about the causes of Tourette''s syndrome. Treating Tourette’s syndrome There''s no cure for Tourette''s syndrome, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. If your child is diagnosed with Tourette''s syndrome, their treatment plan may involve a type of psychological therapy, known as behavioural therapy. Two types of behavioural therapy have been shown to reduce the impact and intensity of tics in some people. These are described below. Habit reversal therapy – involves monitoring the pattern and frequency of the tics and identifying any sensations that trigger them. The next stage is to find an alternative, less noticeable method of relieving the sensations that cause a tic (known as premonitory sensations). This is known as a competing response. Exposure with response prevention (ERP) – involves increasing exposure to the urge to tic to suppress the tic response for longer. This works on the theory that you get used to the feeling of needing to tic until the urge, and any related anxiety, weakens. When the tics are more frequent or severe, medication can help to improve them, such as alpha2-adrenergic agonists, muscle relaxants and dopamine antagonists. Surgery may be recommended in particularly severe cases that don''t respond to treatment. However, surgery for Tourette''s syndrome is rare. Read more about how Tourette’s syndrome is treated. Associated conditions Children with Tourette’s syndrome will usually also have one or more other developmental or behavioural conditions. The two most commonly reported conditions are: obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) – a condition characterised by unwanted persistent obsessive thoughts and useless compulsive behaviour, for example, a compulsion to keep washing your hands due to a fear of catching a serious illness attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) – a behavioural condition with symptoms such as a short attention span, being easily distracted, a tendency to be impulsive and not being able to sit still because you are constantly fidgeting (hyperactivity) Children with Tourette’s syndrome may also have other behavioural problems, such as flying into a sudden rage, or behaving inappropriately or anti-socially with other children. In many cases, these associated conditions and behavioural problems can be more disruptive and troublesome than the tics of Tourette’s syndrome, and are the main focus of treatment. Read more about the conditions associated with Tourette’s syndrome. Outlook In around two-thirds of cases of Tourette''s syndrome, symptoms improve significantly (usually around 10 years after they started). In many of these cases, medication or therapy will no longer be needed to control the person''s tics. Some people''s symptoms become less frequent and troublesome, or they disappear completely. In one third of people with Tourette’s syndrome, the symptoms continue throughout their life. However, they usually become milder as the person gets older. This means the need for medication and therapy may pass over time. Who is affected by Tourette’s syndrome? Tourette’s syndrome is more common than most people realise. It affects around one in every 100 people. The symptoms of Tourette''s syndrome usually begin at around seven years of age and become most pronounced at 10–11 years. For unknown reasons, boys are more likely to be affected by Tourette’s syndrome than girls. Tourette''s syndrome (TS) Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

It''s most commonly used to treat anxiety and depression, but can be useful for other mental and physical health problems. This topic covers: How it works Uses What happens during a session Pros and cons Finding a therapist How CBT works CBT is based on the concept that your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and actions are interconnected, and that negative thoughts and feelings can trap you in a vicious cycle. CBT aims to help you deal with overwhelming problems in a more positive way by breaking them down into smaller parts. You''re shown how to change these negative patterns to improve the way you feel. Unlike some other talking treatments, CBT deals with your current problems, rather than focusing on issues from your past. It looks for practical ways to improve your state of mind on a daily basis. Read more about how CBT works. Uses for CBT CBT has been shown to be an effective way of treating a number of different mental health conditions. In addition to depression or anxiety disorders, CBT can also help people with: obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)  panic disorder post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) phobias eating disorders – such as anorexia and bulimia sleep problems – such as insomnia problems related to alcohol misuse CBT is also sometimes used to treat people with long-term health conditions, such as: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) Although CBT can''t cure the physical symptoms of these conditions, it can help people cope better with their symptoms. What happens during CBT sessions If CBT is recommended, you''ll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every two weeks. The course of treatment usually lasts for between five and 20 sessions, with each session lasting 30-60 minutes. During the sessions, you''ll work with your therapist to break down your problems into their separate parts – such as your thoughts, physical feelings and actions. You and your therapist will analyse these areas to work out if they''re unrealistic or unhelpful and to determine the effect they have on each other and on you. Your therapist will then be able to help you work out how to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours. After working out what you can change, your therapist will ask you to practise these changes in your daily life and you''ll discuss how you got on during the next session. The eventual aim of therapy is to teach you to apply the skills you''ve learnt during treatment to your daily life. This should help you manage your problems and stop them having a negative impact on your life – even after your course of treatment finishes. Pros and cons of CBT Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be as effective as medication in treating some mental health problems, but it may not be successful or suitable for everyone. Some of the advantages of CBT include: it may be helpful in cases where medication alone hasn''t worked it can be completed in a relatively short period of time compared to other talking therapies the highly structured nature of CBT means it can be provided in different formats, including in groups, self-help books and computer programs it teaches you useful and practical strategies that can be used in everyday life – even after the treatment has finished Some of the disadvantages of CBT to consider include: you need to commit yourself to the process to get the most from it – a therapist can help and advise you, but they need your co-operation attending regular CBT sessions and carrying out any extra work between sessions can take up a lot of your time it may not be suitable for people with more complex mental health needs or learning difficulties – as it requires structured sessions it involves confronting your emotions and anxieties – you may experience initial periods where you''re anxious or emotionally uncomfortable it focuses on the individual’s capacity to change themselves (their thoughts, feelings and behaviours) – which doesn''t address any wider problems in systems or families that often have a significant impact on an individual’s health and wellbeing Some critics also argue that because CBT only addresses current problems and focuses on specific issues, it doesn''t address the possible underlying causes of mental health conditions, such as an unhappy childhood. Finding a CBT therapist If you think you have a problem that may benefit from treatment with CBT, the first step is usually to speak to your GP.  Your GP may be able to refer you for CBT that''s free on the NHS, although you may have to wait.  Find psychological therapy services. If you can afford it, you can choose to pay for your therapy privately. The cost of private therapy sessions varies, but it''s usually £40-100 per session. If you''re considering having CBT privately, ask your GP if they can suggest a local therapist. The British Association for Behavioural & Cognitive Psychotherapies (BABCP) keeps a register of all accredited therapists in the UK and The British Psychological Society (BPS) has a directory of chartered psychologists, some of whom specialise in CBT.

Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart, or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the diaphragm.   At a glance: facts about the diaphragm   How it works   Who can use it   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks   Where you can get it   A contraceptive diaphragm is inserted into the vagina before sex, and it covers the cervix so that sperm can''t get into the womb (uterus). You need to use spermicide with it (spermicides kill sperm). The diaphragm must be left in place for at least six hours after sex. After that time, you take out the diaphragm and wash it (they''re reusable). Diaphragms come in different sizes – you must be fitted for the correct size by a trained doctor or nurse. At a glance: contraceptive diaphragm When used correctly with spermicide, a diaphragm is 92-96% effective at preventing pregnancy – this means that between four and eight women out of every 100 who use a diaphragm as contraception will become pregnant within a year. There are no serious health risks. You only have to think about it when you have sex. You can put a diaphragm in several hours before you have sex. It can take time to learn how to use it. Some women develop cystitis (a bladder infection) when they use a diaphragm. Your doctor or nurse can check the size – switching to a smaller size may help. If you lose or gain more than 3kg (7lbs) in weight, or have a baby, miscarriage or abortion, you may need to be fitted with a new diaphragm. By using condoms as well as a diaphragm, you''ll help to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).   How the contraceptive diaphragm works Inserting a diaphragm  Removing a diaphragm Looking after your diaphragm You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people''s services Find a clinic near you A diaphragm (like a cap) is a barrier method of contraception. It fits inside your vagina and prevents sperm from passing through the cervix (the entrance of your womb). Diaphragms are soft, thin domes made of latex (rubber) or silicone, and come in different shapes and sizes. To be effective in preventing pregnancy, diaphragms need to be used in combination with spermicide, which is a chemical that kills sperm. You only have to use a diaphragm when you have sex, but you must leave it in for at least six hours after the last time you had sex. You can leave it in for longer than this, but do not take it out before. When you first start using a diaphragm, a doctor or nurse will examine you and advise on the correct size or shape to suit you. They will show you how to put in and take out a diaphragm, and also how to use the spermicide, which must be applied every time you use the diaphragm. A diaphragm provides only limited protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If you''re at a high risk of getting an STI – for example, you or your partner has more than one sexual partner – you may be advised to use another form of contraception.  Inserting a diaphragm Your doctor or nurse will show you how to put in a diaphragm. Diaphragms come with instructions and are all inserted in a similar way: With clean hands, put a small amount of spermicide on each side of the diaphragm (also putting a little spermicide on the rim may make the diaphragm easier to put in). Put your index finger on top of the diaphragm and squeeze it between your thumb and other fingers. Slide the diaphragm into your vagina, upwards. This should ensure that the diaphragm covers your cervix. Always check that your cervix is covered – it feels like a lump, a bit like the end of your nose. If your cervix is not covered, take the diaphragm out by hooking your finger under the rim or loop (if there is one) and pulling downwards, then try again. Some women squat while they put their diaphragm in; others lie down or stand with one foot up on a chair – use the position that''s easiest for you. You can insert a diaphragm up to three hours before you have sex – after this time, you will need to take it out and put some more spermicide on it. You may be fitted with a temporary diaphragm by your doctor or nurse. This is for you to practise with at home. It allows you to learn how to use it properly, see how it feels and find out if the method is suitable for you. During this time, you are not protected against pregnancy and need to use additional contraception, such as condoms, when you have sex. When you go back for a follow-up appointment with your doctor or nurse, wear the diaphragm so they can check that it is the right size and you have put it in properly. When they are happy that you can use a diaphragm properly, they will give you one to use as contraception. Removing a diaphragm A diaphragm can be easily removed by gently hooking your finger under its rim, loop or strap and pulling it downwards and out. You must leave all types of diaphragm in place for at least six hours after the last time you had sex. You can leave them in for longer than this, but do not leave them in for longer than the recommended time of 30 hours (including the minimum six).  Looking after your diaphragm  After using, you can wash your diaphragm with warm water and mild unperfumed soap. Rinse it thoroughly, then leave it to dry. You will be given a small container for it, which you should keep in a cool, dry place. Never boil a diaphragm. Do not use disinfectant, detergent, oil-based products or talcum powder to keep it clean, as these products can damage it.  Your diaphragm may become discoloured over time, but this does not make it less effective. Always check your diaphragm or cap for any signs of damage before using it.  You can visit your GP or nurse when you want to replace your diaphragm. Most women can use the same diaphragm for a year before they need to replace it. You may need to get a different size diaphragm if you gain or lose more than 3kg (7lb) in weight, or if you have a baby, miscarriage or abortion. Who can use a diaphragm? Most women are able to use a diaphragm. However, they may not be suitable for you if you:  have an unusually shaped or positioned cervix (entrance to the womb), or if you cannot reach your cervix  have weakened vaginal muscles (possibly as a result of giving birth) that cannot hold a diaphragm in place have a sensitivity or an allergy to latex or the chemicals in spermicide  have ever had toxic shock syndrome (a rare but life-threatening bacterial infection)  have repeated urinary tract infections (infection of the urinary system, such as the urethra, bladder or kidneys)  currently have a vaginal infection (wait until your infection clears before using a diaphragm or cap)  are not comfortable touching your vagina  have a high risk of getting an STI – for example, if you have multiple sexual partners Research shows that spermicides which contain the chemical nonoxynol-9 do not protect against STIs and may even increase your risk of getting an infection. A diaphragm may be less effective if: it is damaged – for example, it is torn or has holes  it is not the right size for you you use it without spermicide  you do not use extra spermicide with your diaphragm every time you have more sex  you remove it too soon (less than six hours after the last time you had sex) you use oil-based products, such as baby lotion, bath oils, moisturiser or some vaginal medicines (for example, pessaries) with latex diaphragms – these can damage the latex If any of these things happen, or you have had sex without contraception, you may need to use emergency contraception. You can use a diaphragm after having a baby, but you may need a different size. It is recommended that you wait at least six weeks after giving birth before using a diaphragm. You can use a diaphragm after a miscarriage or abortion, but you may need a different size. Advantages and disadvantages A diaphragm has the following advantages: You only need to use a diaphragm when you want to have sex. You can put it in at a convenient time before having sex (but do not forget to use extra spermicide if you have it in for more than three hours). There are no serious associated health risks or side effects. You are in control of your contraception. A diaphragm has the following disadvantages: It is not as effective as other types of contraception. It only provides limited protection against STIs. It can take time to learn how to use it. Putting it in can interrupt sex. Cystitis (bladder infection) can be a problem for some women who use a diaphragm. Latex and spermicide can cause irritation in some women and their sexual partners. Risks  There are no health risks associated with using a contraceptive diaphragm. Where you can get a diaphragm Most types of contraception are free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries – talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics  some genitourinary (GUM) clinics sexual health clinics – they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people''s services (call the Sexual Health Line on 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching by postcode or town. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you''re under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacists won''t tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you''re given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They''ll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won''t make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you''re at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.

Non-specialist toys can be suitable, but you do need to make sure they are safe for your child to play with. For example, if your child is likely to put the toy in their mouth, make sure it does not have any small parts, which they might swallow. You should also be careful not to leave button batteries around as these can be harmful if swallowed. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents has advice on toy safety. There are many specialist toys designed for children with different disabilities, including those with sight, hearing and mobility issues. You may be able to get advice on choosing toys from a professional working with your child, such as a paediatric occupational therapist. Your GP or local authority can help you contact a local paediatric occupational therapist. Other parents and informal support groups can also be a good source of recommendations, as they may have direct experience of using the toys. You may also find that some disability organisations sell recommended toys and games from their website, or provide links to recommended specialist toy companies. Costs of toys and play equipment Specialist toys can be expensive, but you can cut costs by borrowing them. This is also a good way to ensure a toy is suitable for your child before buying it. Some areas have a local toy library, and this may have play equipment that you could borrow, sometimes for a small fee. You could also reduce the cost by making your own toys, or by using household objects. For example, you can make your own bubble-blowing solution using baby shampoo. If your child has very particular needs and you can’t find anything suitable, the charity Remap may be able to help. Remap has volunteers who can design and produce tailor-made items for people with disabilities. Sensory environments A sensory environment, also known as a multi-sensory environment or a white room, is a safe place where someone with multi-sensory impairments (deafblind) can experience different sounds, textures and colours. These environments can be a specially created room in a school or day centre, or could just be part of a room in your house. The disability charity Sense has tips on setting up a sensory environment at home. More information about toys and play Scope has advice on playing with children who have disabilities. Living Made Easy for Children has a range of suggestions for toys, games and equipment for sensory stimulation The RNIB has advice on how blind or partially sighted children can get the most out of books and reading.

(269, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dyslexia/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Dyslexia', 'Dyslexia - NHS Choices', 'Dyslexia  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Dyslexia is a common learning difficulty that can cause problems with reading, writing and spelling. It''s a "specific learning difficulty", which means it causes problems with certain abilities used for learning, such as reading and writing. Unlike a learning disability, intelligence isn''t affected. It''s estimated that up to 1 in every 10 to 20 people in the UK has some degree of dyslexia. Dyslexia is lifelong problem that can present challenges on a daily basis, but support is available to improve reading and writing skills and help those with the problem be successful at school and work. What are the signs of dyslexia? Signs of dyslexia usually become apparent when a child starts school and begins to focus more on learning how to read and write. A person with dyslexia may: read and write very slowly confuse the order of letters in words put letters the wrong way round – such as writing "b" instead of "d" have poor or inconsistent spelling understand information when told verbally, but have difficulty with information that''s written down find it hard to carry out a sequence of directions struggle with planning and organisation However, people with dyslexia often have good skills in other areas, such as creative thinking and problem solving. Read more about the symptoms of dyslexia. Getting help If you think your child may have dyslexia, the first step is to speak to their teacher or their school''s special needs coordinator (SENCO) about your concerns. They may be able to offer additional support to help your child if necessary. If your child continues to have problems despite extra support, you or the school may want to consider requesting a more in-depth assessment from a specialist dyslexia teacher or an educational psychologist. This can be arranged through the school, or you can request a private assessment by contacting: an educational psychologist directly – you can find a directory of chartered psychologists on the British Psychological Society''s website a voluntary organisation that can arrange an assessment, such as Dyslexia Action or a local dyslexia association Adults who wish to be assessed for dyslexia should contact a local or national dyslexia association (see below) for advice. Read more about how dyslexia is diagnosed Support for people with dyslexia If your child has dyslexia, they''ll probably need extra educational support from their school. With appropriate support, there''s usually no reason your child can''t go to a mainstream school, although a small number of children may benefit from attending a specialist school. Techniques and support that may help your child include: occasional one-to-one teaching or lessons in a small group with a specialist teacher phonics – a special learning technique that focuses on improving the ability to identify and process the smaller sounds that make up words technology, such as computers and speech recognition software, that may make it easier for your child to read and write when they''re a bit older Universities also have specialist staff who can support young people with dyslexia in higher education. Technology such as word processors and electronic organisers can be useful for adults too. Employers are required to make reasonable adjustments to the workplace to help people with dyslexia, such as allowing extra time for certain tasks. Read more about how dyslexia is managed. Support groups As well as national dyslexia charities, such as Dyslexia Action and the British Dyslexia Association (BDA), there are several local dyslexia associations (LDAs). These are independently registered charities that run workshops and help to provide local support and access to information. You can find your local LDA on the BDA website. What causes dyslexia? People with dyslexia find it difficult to recognise the different sounds that make up words and relate these to letters.  Dyslexia isn''t related to a person''s general level of intelligence. Children and adults of all intellectual abilities can be affected by dyslexia. The exact cause of dyslexia is unknown, but it often appears to run in families. In people with dyslexia, it''s thought that certain genes inherited from your parents may act together in a way that affects how some parts of brain develop during early life.

(270, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gastrectomy/pages/complications.aspx', 'Dumping syndrome', 'Gastrectomy - Complications - NHS Choices', 'Gastrectomy - Complications  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Complications of gastrectomy   As with any type of surgery, a gastrectomy carries a risk of complications. Problems can also occur because of changes in the way you digest food. Cancer Gastrectomies to treat stomach cancer have a higher risk of complications, because most people who have this type of surgery are elderly and often in poor health. Complications can also occur after a gastrectomy to treat oesophageal cancer. The oesophagus is the tube connecting your throat to your stomach. Possible complications of a gastrectomy include: wound infection leaking from where the stomach has been closed or reattached to the small intestine stricture – where stomach acid leaks up into your oesophagus and over time causes scarring, leading to the oesophagus becoming narrow and constricted chest infection internal bleeding blockage of the small intestine (small bowel) An infection can usually be treated with antibiotics, but some other complications will require further surgery. Before your operation, ask your surgeon to explain the possible risks and how likely they are to affect you. It''s estimated that around 2 in 100 people who have a gastrectomy for cancer die from complications. Obesity Possible complications of a gastrectomy for obesity include: nausea and vomiting – which usually get better over time internal bleeding – which can lead to blood clots forming leaking from where the stomach has been closed acid reflux – where stomach acid leaks back up into the oesophagus infection It may be possible to treat some complications with medication, but others may need further surgery. Before your operation, ask your surgeon to explain the possible risks and how likely they are to affect you. The risk of death from a gastrectomy for obesity is very low, estimated as less than 1 in 100. Vitamin deficiency One function of your stomach is to absorb vitamins, particularly vitamins B12, C and D, from the food you eat. If your entire stomach has been removed, you may not get all the vitamins your body needs from your diet. This may lead to certain health conditions, such as: Anaemia  The body requires vitamin B12 to make healthy blood cells. Without enough healthy blood cells, you could develop symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness and breathlessness. Increased vulnerability to infection Vitamin C helps to strengthen your immune system (the body''s natural defence against infection and illness). If you don''t have enough vitamin C in your diet, you may develop frequent infections. Wounds or burns will also take longer to heal. Brittle bones and weakened muscles Your body needs vitamin D to keep both your bones and muscles strong and healthy. If there isn''t enough vitamin D in your diet, you could develop pain and weakness in your bones (osteoporosis) and muscles. Changing your diet may help to compensate for your stomach''s inability to absorb vitamins. However, even after changing your diet, you may need vitamin supplements. The healthcare professionals treating you can advise on this. Read about recovering from a gastrectomy for more information on diet and supplements. Weight loss Immediately after surgery, you may find that eating even a small meal makes you feel uncomfortably full. This could lead to weight loss. Losing weight may be desirable if you''ve had a gastrectomy because you''re obese, but it can be a health risk if you''ve been treated for cancer. Some people who have a gastrectomy regain weight once they have adjusted to the effects of surgery and have changed their diet. However, if you continue to lose weight, see a dietitian (a healthcare professional who specialises in nutrition). A dietitian can give you advice on how to increase your weight without upsetting your digestive system. Dumping syndrome Dumping syndrome is a set of symptoms that can affect people after a gastrectomy. It''s caused when particularly sugary or starchy food moves suddenly into your small intestine. Before a gastrectomy, your stomach digested most of the sugar and starch. However, after surgery your stomach can no longer do this, so your small intestine has to draw in water from the rest of your body to help break down the food. The amount of water that enters your small intestine can be as much as 1.5 litres (3 pints). Much of the extra water is taken from your blood, which means you will experience a sudden fall in blood pressure. The drop in blood pressure can cause symptoms such as: faintness sweating palpitations a need to lie down The extra water in your small intestine will cause symptoms such as: bloating rumbling stomach nausea indigestion diarrhoea If you have dumping syndrome, resting for 20-45 minutes after eating a meal may help. To ease the symptoms of dumping syndrome: eat slowly avoid sugary foods – such as cakes, chocolate and sweets slowly add more fibre to your diet avoid soup and other liquid foods eat smaller, more frequent meals Seek advice from your hospital team or dietitian if you have symptoms of dumping syndrome. For most people, the symptoms improve over time. Morning vomiting After a partial gastrectomy, a small number of people may experience morning vomiting. Vomiting occurs when bile (a fluid used by the digestive system to break down fats) and digestive juices build up in your duodenum overnight, before spilling back into what remains of your stomach. The duodenum is the first part of your small intestine. Due to its reduced size, your stomach is likely to feel uncomfortably full and this will trigger a vomiting reflex to get rid of the excess fluids and bile. Taking indigestion medication, such as aluminium hydroxide, may help to reduce the symptoms of morning vomiting. See your GP if your symptoms are particularly troublesome. Diarrhoea During a gastrectomy, it''s sometimes necessary to cut a nerve called the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve helps to control the movement of food through your digestive system. Although the vagus nerve will heal after surgery, a small number of people will experience bouts of severe diarrhoea. However, they usually only occur now and again, and should pass within a day or so. Taking diarrhoea medication, such as loperamide, in the morning may help to reduce your symptoms.

The impulsive, fearless and chaotic behaviours typical of ADHD can make normal everyday activities exhausting and stressful. Ways to cope Although it can be difficult at times, it''s important to remember that a child with ADHD can''t help their behaviour. People with ADHD find it difficult to suppress impulses, which means they don''t stop to consider a situation or the consequences before they act. If you''re looking after a child with ADHD, you may find the below advice helpful. Plan the day Plan the day so your child knows what to expect. Set routines can make a difference to how a child with ADHD copes with everyday life. For example, if your child has to get ready for school, break it down into structured steps, so they know exactly what they need to do. Set clear boundaries Make sure everyone knows what behaviour is expected, and reinforce positive behaviour with immediate praise or rewards. Be clear, using enforceable consequences if boundaries are overstepped (such as taking away a privilege) and follow these through consistently. Be positive Give specific praise. Instead of saying a general, "Thanks for doing that," you could say, "You washed the dishes really well. Thank you." This will make it clear to your child that you''re pleased, and why. Giving instructions If you''re asking your child to do something, give brief instructions and be specific. Instead of asking, "Can you tidy your bedroom?" say, "Please put your toys into the box, and put the books back onto the shelf." This makes it clearer what your child needs to do and creates opportunities for praise when they get it right. Incentive scheme Set up your own incentive scheme using a points chart or star chart, so good behaviour can earn a privilege. For example, behaving well on a shopping trip will earn your child time on the computer or some sort of game. Involve your child in it and allow them to help decide what the privileges will be. These charts need regular changes or they become boring. Targets should be: immediate (for example, daily) intermediate (for example, weekly) long-term (for example, three-monthly) Try to focus on just one or two behaviours at a time. Intervene early Watch for warning signs. If your child looks like they''re becoming frustrated, overstimulated and about to lose self-control, intervene. Distract your child if possible, by taking them away from the situation, which may calm them down. Social situations Keep social situations short and sweet. Invite friends to play, but keep playtimes short, so your child doesn''t lose self-control. Don''t aim to do this when your child is feeling tired or hungry, such as after a day at school. Exercise Make sure your child gets lots of physical activity during the day. Walking, skipping and playing sport can help your child wear themselves out and improve their quality of sleep. Make sure they''re not doing anything too strenuous or exciting near to bedtime. Read our page on health and fitness, which includes information on getting active, and how much activity you and your child should be doing. Eating Keep an eye on what your child eats. If your child is hyperactive after eating certain foods, which may contain additives or caffeine, keep a diary of these and discuss them with your GP. Bedtime Stick to a routine. Make sure your child goes to bed at the same time each night and gets up at the same time in the morning. Avoid overstimulating activities in the hours before bedtime, such as computer games or watching TV. Night time Sleep problems and ADHD can be a vicious circle. ADHD can lead to sleep problems, which in turn can make symptoms worse. Many children with ADHD will repeatedly get up after being put to bed and have interrupted sleep patterns. Trying a sleep-friendly routine can help your child and make bedtime less of a battleground. Read more information about creating a bedtime ritual for better sleep. Help at school Children with ADHD often have problems with their behaviour at school, and the condition can have a negative impact on a child''s academic progress. Speak to your child''s teachers or their school''s special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) about any extra support your child may need. Adults with ADHD If you''re an adult living with ADHD, you may find the following advice useful: Make lists, keep diaries, stick up reminders and set aside some time to plan what you need to do if you find it hard to stay organised. Let off steam by exercising regularly. Find ways to help you relax, such as listening to music or learning relaxation techniques. If you have a job, speak to your employer about your condition, and discuss anything they can do to help you work better. Talk to your doctor about your suitability to drive, as you''ll need to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) if your ADHD affects your driving. Contact or join a local or national support group – these organisations can put you in touch with other people in a similar situation, and they can be a good source of support, information and advice. For more advice, you can read about living with ADHD on the AADD-UK website. AADD-UK is a charity specifically for adults with ADHD. AADD-UK also has a list of adult support groups across the UK.

If the MMR vaccine isn''t suitable for you, a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) can be used if you''re at immediate risk of catching measles. MMR vaccine Routine vaccination The MMR vaccine is given as part of the routine NHS childhood vaccination programme. One dose is usually given to a child when they''re 12-13 months old and a second dose is given before they start school, usually between three and five years old. Contact your GP if you are uncertain about whether your child''s vaccinations are up-to-date. You or your child can be vaccinated at any point if you haven''t been fully vaccinated before. If you''re not sure whether you were vaccinated in the past, having the vaccine again won''t cause any harm. Special circumstances A dose of the MMR vaccine can also be given to anyone over six months of age if they''re at an immediate risk of catching measles. For example, this could be if: there''s an outbreak of measles in your local area you''ve been in close contact with someone who has measles you''re planning on travelling to an area where the infection is widespread Children who have the vaccine before their first birthday should still have the two routine doses at around 13 months of age and before they start school. Human normal immunoglobulin Human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) is a special concentration of antibodies that can give short-term but immediate protection against measles. It may be recommended for people in the following groups if they''ve been exposed to someone with measles: babies under six months of age pregnant women who haven''t been fully vaccinated or haven''t had measles before people with weak immune systems – for example, those with HIV or people receiving treatment that weakens their immune system, such as treatment for leukaemia HNIG should ideally be given within six days of exposure. Stopping measles spreading to others If you already have measles, it''s important to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to other people.

Genetics ADHD tends to run in families and, in most cases, it''s thought the genes you inherit from your parents are a significant factor in developing the condition. Research shows that both parents and siblings of a child with ADHD are four to five times more likely to have ADHD themselves. However, the way ADHD is inherited is likely to be complex and isn''t thought to be related to a single genetic fault. Brain function and structure Research has identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared to those who don''t have the condition, although the exact significance of these isn''t clear. For example, studies involving brain scans have suggested that certain areas of the brain may be smaller in people with ADHD, whereas other areas may be larger. Research has also shown that the brain may take an average of two to three years longer to mature in children with ADHD, compared to children who don''t have the condition. Other studies have suggested that people with ADHD may have an imbalance in the level of neurotransmitters in the brain, or that these chemicals may not work properly. Other possible causes Various other causes have also been suggested as playing a role in the development of ADHD, including: being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) having a low birthweight brain damage either in the womb or in the first few years of life drinking alcohol, smoking or misusing drugs while pregnant exposure to high levels of toxic lead at a young age However, the evidence for many of these factors is inconclusive, and more research is needed to determine if they contribute to ADHD.

(274, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cardiomyopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Dilated cardiomyopathy', 'Cardiomyopathy - NHS Choices', 'Cardiomyopathy  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', '  Cardiomyopathy is a general term for diseases of the heart muscle, where the walls of the heart chambers have become stretched, thickened or stiff. This affects the heart''s ability to pump blood around the body. Some types of cardiomyopathy are inherited and are seen in children and younger people. This page explains the main types of cardiomyopathy: dilated cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy takotsubo cardiomyopathy or ''broken heart syndrome'' It then explains:  diagnosing cardiomyopathy treating cardiomyopathy information about you Dilated cardiomyopathy In dilated cardiomyopathy the muscle walls of the heart have become stretched and thin, so they can''t contract (squeeze) properly to pump blood around the body. How serious is it? If you have dilated cardiomyopathy, you''re at greater risk of heart failure, where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure. Heart failure typically causes shortness of breath, extreme tiredness and ankle swelling. Learn more about the symptoms of heart failure. There''s also a risk of heart valve problems, an irregular heartbeat and blood clots. You''ll need to have regular appointments with your GP so the disease can be monitored. Who''s affected? Dilated cardiomyopathy can affect both children and adults.  The heart muscle can become stretched if you have an unhealthy lifestyle or an underlying medical condition, or both. The following can all play a role in the disease: uncontrolled high blood pressure an unhealthy lifestyle – such as a lack of vitamins and minerals in the diet, heavy drinking and recreational drug use a viral infection that causes inflammation of the heart muscle   a heart valve problem a disease of the body tissues or vessels – such as Wegener''s granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, lupus, polyarteritis nodosa, vasculitis or muscular dystrophy inheriting a mutated (changed) gene that makes you more vulnerable to the disease pregnancy – cardiomyopathy can sometimes develop as a complication of pregnancy But for many people, the cause is unknown. More information Read the British Heart Foundation''s detailed booklet on living with dilated cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle cells have enlarged and the walls of the heart chambers thicken. The chambers are reduced in size so they can''t hold much blood, and the walls can''t relax properly and may stiffen. How serious is it? Most people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will be able to live a full, normal life. Some people don''t even have symptoms and don''t need treatment. But that doesn''t mean the condition can''t be serious. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden unexpected death in childhood and in young athletes. The main heart chambers can become stiff, leading to back pressure on the smaller collecting chambers. This can sometimes worsen the symptoms of heart failure and lead to abnormal heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation). Blood flow from the heart may become reduced or restricted (known as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Also, the mitral heart valve can become leaky, causing blood to leak backwards. Read more about mitral regurgitation. These heart changes can cause dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath and temporary loss of consciousness. You''ll also be at greater risk of developing endocarditis (a heart infection). If you have severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, you''ll need to see your doctor regularly so your condition can be monitored. Your doctor will advise about the level and amount of exercise you can do and sensible lifestyle changes to make.  Who''s affected? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is thought to affect 1 in 500 people in the UK. Most people inherit the disease from their parents. Read more about how genetic conditions are inherited.   More information Read the British Heart Foundation''s detailed booklet on living with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy is rare and mostly affects older adults. The walls of the main heart chambers become stiffened and rigid and can''t relax properly after contracting. This means the heart can''t fill up properly with blood. It results in reduced blood flow from the heart and can lead to symptoms of heart failure, such as breathlessness, tiredness and ankle swelling, as well as heart rhythm problems. In many cases the cause is unknown, although sometimes it can be inherited. More information Read the American Heart Association''s leaflet on restrictive cardiomyopathy (PDF, 102kb). Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy In arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), the proteins that normally hold the heart muscle cells together are abnormal. Muscle cells can die and the dead muscle tissue is replaced with fatty and fibrous tissue. The walls of the main heart chambers become thin and stretched, and can''t pump blood around the body properly. People with ARVC typically have heart rhythm problems. Reduced blood flow from the heart can also lead to symptoms of heart failure. ARVC is an uncommon inherited condition caused by a mutation (change) in one or more genes. It can affect teenagers or young adults and has been the reason for some sudden unexplained deaths in young athletes. There''s increasing evidence that prolonged, strenuous exercise worsens the symptoms of ARVC. It''s important that people with or at risk of ARVC have a careful discussion about this with their cardiologist. More information Read the British Heart Foundation''s detailed booklet on ARVC. Diagnosing cardiomyopathy Some cases of cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed after various heart scans and tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram. Cardiomyopathy that runs in the family can be diagnosed after a genetic test. If you''ve been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, you may be advised to have a genetic test to identify the mutation (faulty gene) that caused this. Your relatives can then be tested for the same mutation and, if they have it, their condition can be monitored and managed early. Treating cardiomyopathy  There''s no cure for cardiomyopathy, but the treatments described below are usually effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications. Not everyone with cardiomyopathy will need treatment. Some people only have a mild form of the disease that they can control after making a few lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes If the cause of your cardiomyopathy isn''t genetic, it should generally help to: follow a healthy diet and take gentle exercise quit smoking (if you smoke) lose weight (if you''re overweight) avoid or reduce your intake of alcohol  get plenty of sleep manage stress make sure any underlying condition, such as diabetes, is well controlled  Medication Medication may be needed to control blood pressure, correct an abnormal heart rhythm, remove excess fluid or prevent blood clots.  Read about: medication for high blood pressure beta-blockers to treat an irregular heartbeat or heart failure diuretics to remove excess fluid from your body if this has caused swelling anticoagulants such as warfarin to prevent blood clots medication to treat heart failure Hospital procedures In some people with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the septum (the wall dividing the left and right side of the heart) is thickened and bulges into the main heart chamber. They may need to have either: an injection of alcohol into their heart – this is to reduce part of the muscle in the septum a septal myectomy – heart surgery to remove part of the thickened septum (the mitral valve may be repaired at the same time, if necessary) Those with heart rhythm problems may need to have a pacemaker, or a similar device, implanted to control their abnormal heart rhythm. Read more about having a pacemaker fitted. As a last resort, a heart transplant may be necessary. Information about you If you have cardiomyopathy, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. GOV.UK has more information about the register. Broken heart syndrome Some people who sustain significant emotional or physical stress, such as bereavement or major surgery, go on to experience a temporary heart problem. The heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or "stunned", causing the left ventricle (one of the heart''s main chambers) to change shape. It may be caused by a surge of hormones, particularly adrenaline, during this period of stress. The main symptoms are chest pain and breathlessness, similar to those of a heart attack – always call 999 if you or someone else experiences these. The condition – known medically as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or acute stress cardiomyopathy – is temporary and reversible. It''s unusual for it to happen again.

Stopping the bleeding, cleaning the wound thoroughly and covering it with a plaster or dressing is usually all that''s needed. Minor wounds should start to heal within a few days. This page covers: How to treat cuts and grazes When to get medical help When to go to accident and emergency (A&E) How to treat cuts and grazes Stop the bleeding Stop any bleeding before applying a dressing to the wound. Apply pressure to the area using a clean and dry absorbent material – such as a bandage, towel or handkerchief – for several minutes. If the cut is to your hand or arm, raise it above your head to help reduce the flow of blood. If the injury is to a lower limb, lie down and raise the affected area above the level of your heart. Clean the wound and apply a dressing When the wound has stopped bleeding, clean it and cover it with a dressing to help stop it becoming infected. To do this: wash and dry your hands thoroughly clean the wound under drinking-quality running tap water – avoid using antiseptic as it may damage the skin and slow healing pat the area dry with a clean towel apply a sterile adhesive dressing, such as a plaster – read more about how to apply plasters and other dressings Keep the dressing clean by changing it as often as necessary. Keep the wound dry by using waterproof dressings, which will allow you to take showers. You can remove the dressing after a few days, once the wound has closed itself. Take painkillers if needed If the wound is painful for the first few days, you can take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. When to get medical help Call NHS 111 or visit your local walk-in centre, minor injuries unit or GP surgery if there''s a risk your wound could become infected, or you think it''s already infected. A wound is at risk of infection if: it has been contaminated with dirt, pus or other bodily fluids there was something in the wound before it was cleaned, such as gravel or a shard of glass it has a jagged edge it''s longer than 5cm (2 inches) it was caused by an animal or human bite Signs a wound has become infected include: swelling, redness and increasing pain in the affected area pus forming in or around the wound feeling generally unwell a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above swollen glands under the chin or in the neck, armpits or groin An infected wound can usually be successfully treated with a short course of antibiotics. When to go to A&E Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible if: you cannot stop the bleeding you''re bleeding from an artery – blood from an artery comes out in spurts with each beat of the heart, and is bright red and usually hard to control you experience persisting or significant loss of sensation near the wound or you''re having trouble moving any body parts you have received a severe cut to the face – you may require urgent treatment to prevent scarring you have received a cut to the palm of your hand and it looks infected – these types of infection can spread quickly there''s a possibility a foreign body is still inside the wound the wound is very large or the injury has caused a lot of tissue damage In A&E, your wound will be examined to determine whether there''s any risk of infection. You may need a booster injection to prevent tetanus, and your wound may be closed with stitches, strips or special glue before a dressing is applied. If your wound is at risk of infection, it won''t usually be closed because this may trap any infection inside. Instead, it will be packed with a non-sticky dressing before being covered with a protective dressing until it''s safe to close.

These categories are: inattentiveness hyperactivity and impulsiveness Most people with ADHD have problems that fall into both these categories, but this isn''t always the case. For example, some people with the condition may have problems with inattentiveness, but not with hyperactivity or impulsiveness. This form of ADHD is also known as attention deficit disorder (ADD). ADD can sometimes go unnoticed because the symptoms may be less obvious. Symptoms in children and teenagers The symptoms of ADHD in children and teenagers are well defined, and they''re usually noticeable before the age of six. They occur in more than one situation, such as at home and at school. The main signs of each behavioural problem are detailed below. Inattentiveness The main signs of inattentiveness are: having a short attention span and being easily distracted making careless mistakes – for example, in schoolwork appearing forgetful or losing things being unable to stick at tasks that are tedious or time-consuming appearing to be unable to listen to or carry out instructions constantly changing activity or task having difficulty organising tasks Hyperactivity and impulsiveness The main signs of hyperactivity and impulsiveness are: being unable to sit still, especially in calm or quiet surroundings constantly fidgeting being unable to concentrate on tasks excessive physical movement excessive talking being unable to wait their turn acting without thinking interrupting conversations little or no sense of danger These symptoms can cause significant problems in a child''s life, such as underachievement at school, poor social interaction with other children and adults, and problems with discipline. Related conditions in children and teenagers Although not always the case, some children may also have signs of other problems or conditions alongside ADHD, such as: anxiety disorder – which causes your child to worry and be nervous much of the time; it may also cause physical symptoms, such as a rapid heartbeat, sweating and dizziness oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) – this is defined by negative and disruptive behaviour, particularly towards authority figures, such as parents and teachers conduct disorder – this often involves a tendency towards highly antisocial behaviour, such as stealing, fighting, vandalism and harming people or animals depression sleep problems – finding it difficult to get to sleep at night, and having irregular sleeping patterns autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) – this affects social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour epilepsy – a condition that affects the brain and causes repeated fits or seizures Tourette’s syndrome – a condition of the nervous system, characterised by a combination of involuntary noises and movements called tics learning difficulties – such as dyslexia Symptoms in adults In adults, the symptoms of ADHD are more difficult to define. This is largely due to a lack of research into adults with ADHD. ADHD is a developmental disorder; it''s believed that it can''t develop in adults without it first appearing during childhood. But it''s known that symptoms of ADHD often persist from childhood into a person''s teenage years, and then adulthood. Any additional problems or conditions experienced by children with ADHD, such as depression or dyslexia, may also continue into adulthood. By the age of 25, an estimated 15% of people diagnosed with ADHD as children still have a full range of symptoms, and 65% still have some symptoms that affect their daily lives. The symptoms in children and teenagers, which are listed above, is sometimes also applied to adults with possible ADHD. But some specialists say that the way in which inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness affect adults can be very different from the way they affect children. For example, hyperactivity tends to decrease in adults, while inattentiveness tends to get worse as the pressure of adult life increases. Adult symptoms of ADHD also tend to be far more subtle than childhood symptoms. Some specialists have suggested the following list of symptoms associated with ADHD in adults: carelessness and lack of attention to detail continually starting new tasks before finishing old ones poor organisational skills inability to focus or prioritise continually losing or misplacing things forgetfulness restlessness and edginess difficulty keeping quiet and speaking out of turn blurting out responses and often interrupting others mood swings, irritability and a quick temper inability to deal with stress extreme impatience taking risks in activities, often with little or no regard for personal safety or the safety of others – for example, driving dangerously Additional problems in adults with ADHD As with ADHD in children and teenagers, ADHD in adults can occur alongside several related problems or conditions. One of the most common conditions is depression. Other conditions that adults may have alongside ADHD include: personality disorders – conditions in which an individual differs significantly from an average person, in terms of how they think, perceive, feel or relate to others bipolar disorder – a condition that affects your moods, which can swing from one extreme to another obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) – a condition that causes obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviour The behavioural problems associated with ADHD can also cause problems such as difficulties with relationships, social interaction, drugs and crime. Some adults with ADHD find it hard to find and stay in a job. Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 25/04/2016 Next review due: 01/04/2019', 1745981764),

(279, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/diabetic-eye-screening/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Diabetic eye screening', 'Diabetic eye screening - NHS Choices', 'Diabetic eye screening  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', '  Diabetic eye screening is a key part of diabetes care. People with diabetes are at risk of damage from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it''s not treated. Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most common causes of sight loss among people of working age. It occurs when diabetes affects small blood vessels, damaging the part of the eye called the retina. When the blood vessels in the central area of the retina (the macula) are affected, it''s known as diabetic maculopathy. People with diabetes should also see their optician every two years for a regular eye test. Diabetic eye screening is specifically for diabetic retinopathy and can''t be relied upon for other conditions. This page covers: Why it''s needed When it''s offered Eye screening in pregnancy What happens during screening Results Private screening Why eye screening is needed Screening is a way of detecting the condition early before you notice any changes to your vision. Diabetic retinopathy doesn''t usually cause any noticeable symptoms in the early stages. If retinopathy is detected early enough, treatment can stop it getting worse. Otherwise, by the time symptoms become noticeable, it can be much more difficult to treat. This is why the NHS Diabetic Eye Screening Programme was introduced. Everyone aged 12 and over with diabetes is offered screening once a year. Diabetic retinopathy is extremely unusual in children with diabetes who are under the age of 12.  The check takes about half an hour and involves examining the back of the eyes and taking photographs of the retina. When diabetic eye screening is offered Everyone with diabetes who is 12 years of age or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year. You should receive a letter from your local Diabetic Eye Screening Service inviting you to attend a screening appointment. The letter will include a leaflet about diabetic eye screening. People with diabetes can opt out of the screening programme if they choose. They should confirm this decision in writing to the screening service that has invited them for diabetic eye screening Contact your local screening service or your GP if you haven''t received a letter and your appointment is overdue. You can look up your local screening service here – your service will be the one nearest to your GP surgery. The invitation will say where you need to go. This may be your GP surgery, your local hospital, a local optician''s practice, or another nearby clinic. Bring all the glasses and contact lenses you wear, along with lens solution for contacts. If you have sight problems in between screening appointments, such as sudden vision loss or a deterioration in your vision, seek immediate medical advice. Don''t wait until your next screening appointment. Diabetic eye screening in pregnancy If you have diabetes and become pregnant, you''ll need special care as there are risks to both mother and baby associated with the condition. You''ll be offered additional tests for diabetic retinopathy at or soon after your first antenatal clinic visit, and also after 28 weeks of pregnancy. If the early stages of retinopathy are found at the first screening, you''ll also be offered another test between 16 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. If serious retinopathy is found at any screening, you''ll be referred to an eye specialist. Some women who don''t have diabetes can develop hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) during pregnancy. This is known as gestational diabetes. Pregnant women who develop gestational diabetes aren''t offered screening for diabetic retinopathy. What happens during diabetic eye screening The screening appointment should last about 30 minutes. When you arrive, the procedure will be explained to you. If you have any questions, ask the healthcare professional who is treating you. You''ll be given eye drops to enlarge your pupils, which takes between 15 and 20 minutes, and photographs of your retina will be taken.   There will be a flash of light each time a photograph is taken, but the camera won''t touch your eye. Although the light is bright, it shouldn''t be uncomfortable. The eye drops may cause your eyes to sting slightly, and after about 15 minutes your vision will be blurred. You may find it difficult to focus on objects that are close to you. Depending on the type of eye drops used, the blurring can last between two and six hours. You won''t be able to drive home from your appointment, so you may want to bring someone with you. After the screening procedure, you may also find that everything looks very bright. You may want to take a pair of sunglasses to wear afterwards. Side effects In very rare cases, the eye drops can cause a sudden pressure increase within the eye. This requires prompt treatment at an eye unit. The symptoms of a pressure increase are: pain or severe discomfort in your eye redness of the white of your eye constantly blurred vision, sometimes with rainbow halos around lights If you experience any of these symptoms after screening, go back to the screening centre or your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Your screening results Within six weeks, both you and your GP should receive a letter letting you know your results. You won''t get the results immediately as the photographs need to be studied by a number of different healthcare professionals, including someone who is trained in identifying and grading retinopathy. The screening results may show either: no retinopathy background retinopathy – also called stage one retinopathy degrees of referable retinopathy – this means retinopathy that requires referral to an eye specialist for further assessment and treatment You may need to have a further assessment if: the photographs aren''t clear enough to give an accurate result you have retinopathy that could affect your sight and follow-up treatment is needed you have retinopathy that needs to be checked more than once a year other eye conditions are detected, such as glaucoma (a group of eye conditions that affect vision) or cataracts (cloudy patches in the lens of the eye) If your results show no retinopathy or background retinopathy, you''ll be invited back for another screening appointment a year later. You can also reduce your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy in the future by controlling your blood sugar levels and blood pressure. Read more about preventing diabetic retinopathy. If screening detects signs that diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy is threatening your sight, you''ll be given information about how far the condition has progressed. This will determine the type of treatment you receive. Read about the treatment options for diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy. If you have questions about your results, contact your local diabetic eye screening service. Their details should be on the letter you received from them. Alternatively, you can find your local screening service here. Private screening for diabetic retinopathy Eye checks for diabetic retinopathy are available privately but they won''t necessarily be quality-assured in the same way as the NHS Diabetic Eye Screening Programme. If you''re considering private screening, check that the company is properly regulated and ask for clear written information about the benefits as well as the risks of any tests offered. Find further information in the UK National Screening Committee''s leaflet on private screening. Diabetic retinopathy screening Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

Some people find their psoriasis causes itching or soreness. There are several different types of psoriasis. Many people have only one form of psoriasis at a time, although two different types can occur together. One type may change into another type, or become more severe. Most cases of psoriasis go through cycles, causing problems for a few weeks or months before easing or stopping. You should see your GP if you think you may have psoriasis. Common types of psoriasis Plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris) This is the most common form, accounting for about 80% of cases. Its symptoms are dry, red skin lesions, known as plaques, which are covered in silver scales. They normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. The plaques can be itchy, sore or both. In severe cases, the skin around your joints may crack and bleed.  Scalp psoriasis This can occur on parts of your scalp or on the whole scalp. It causes red patches of skin covered in thick silvery-white scales. Some people find scalp psoriasis extremely itchy, while others have no discomfort. In extreme cases it can cause hair loss, although this is usually only temporary. Nail psoriasis In about half of all people with psoriasis, the condition affects the nails. Psoriasis can cause your nails to develop tiny dents or pits, become discoloured, or grow abnormally. Nails can often become loose and separate from your nail bed. In severe cases, your nails may crumble. Guttate psoriasis Guttate psoriasis causes small (less than 1cm or 1/3 inch) drop-shaped sores on your chest, arms, legs and scalp. There''s a good chance that guttate psoriasis will disappear completely after a few weeks, but some people go on to develop plaque psoriasis. This type of psoriasis sometimes occurs after a streptococcal throat infection and is more common among children and teenagers. Inverse (flexural) psoriasis This affects folds or creases in your skin, such as the armpits, groin, between the buttocks and under the breasts. It can cause large, smooth red patches in some or all of these areas. Inverse psoriasis is made worse by friction and sweating, so it can be particularly uncomfortable in hot weather. Pustular psoriasis Pustular psoriasis is a rarer type of psoriasis that causes pus-filled blisters (pustules) to appear on your skin. Different types of pustular psoriasis affect different parts of the body. Generalised pustular psoriasis or von Zumbusch psoriasis This causes pustules on a wide area of skin, which develop very quickly. The pus consists of white blood cells and is not a sign of infection. The pustules may reappear every few days or weeks in cycles. During the start of these cycles, von Zumbusch psoriasis can cause fever, chills, weight loss and fatigue. Palmoplantar pustular psoriasis This causes pustules to appear on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. The pustules gradually develop into circular brown, scaly spots, which then peel off. Pustules may reappear every few days or weeks. Acropustulosis This causes pustules to appear on your fingers and toes. The pustules then burst, leaving bright red areas that may ooze or become scaly. These may lead to painful nail deformities. Erythrodermic psoriasis Erythrodermic psoriasis is a rare form of psoriasis that affects nearly all the skin on the body. This can cause intense itching or burning. Erythrodermic psoriasis can cause your body to lose proteins and fluid, leading to further problems such as infection, dehydration, heart failure, hypothermia and malnutrition. Want to know more?

ADHD can be treated using medication or therapy, but a combination of both is often best. Treatment is usually arranged by a specialist, such as a paediatrician or psychiatrist, although the condition may be monitored by your GP.  Medication There are five types of medication licensed for the treatment of ADHD: methylphenidate  dexamfetamine lisdexamfetamine atomoxetine guanfacine These medications aren''t a permanent cure for ADHD, but may help someone with the condition concentrate better, be less impulsive, feel calmer, and learn and practise new skills. Some medications need to be taken every day, but some can be taken just on school days. Treatment breaks are occasionally recommended, to assess whether the medication is still needed. In the UK, all of these medications are licensed for use in children and teenagers. Atomoxetine is also licensed for use in adults who had symptoms of ADHD as children. If you weren''t diagnosed with ADHD until adulthood, your GP and specialist can discuss which medications and therapies are suitable for you. If you or your child is prescribed one of these medications, you''ll probably be given small doses at first, which may then be gradually increased. You or your child will need to see your GP for regular check-ups, to ensure the treatment is working effectively and to check for signs of any side effects or problems. Your specialist will discuss how long you should take your treatment but, in many cases, treatment is continued for as long as it is helping. Methylphenidate Methylphenidate is the most commonly used medication for ADHD. It belongs to a group of medicines called stimulants that work by increasing activity in the brain, particularly in areas that play a part in controlling attention and behaviour. Methylphenidate can be used by teenagers and children with ADHD over the age of six. Although methylphenidate isn''t licensed for use in adults, it may be taken under close supervision from your GP and specialist. The medication can be taken as either immediate-release tablets (small doses taken two to three times a day), or as modified-release tablets (taken once a day in the morning, and they release the dose throughout the day). Common side effects of methylphenidate include: a small increase in blood pressure and heart rate loss of appetite, which can lead to weight loss or poor weight gain trouble sleeping headaches stomach aches mood swings Dexamfetamine Dexamfetamine is also a stimulant medication, which works in a similar way to methylphenidate by stimulating areas of the brain that play a part in controlling attention and behaviour. Dexamfetamine can be used by teenagers and children with ADHD over the age of three. Although it''s not licensed for use in adults, it may be taken under close supervision from your GP and specialist. Dexamfetamine is usually taken as a tablet once or twice a day, although an oral solution is also available. Common side effects of dexamfetamine include: decreased appetite mood swings agitation and aggression dizziness headaches diarrhoea nausea and vomiting Lisdexamfetamine Lisdexamfetamine is a similar medication to dexamfetamine, and works in the same way. It can be used by children with ADHD over the age of six if treatment with methylphenidate hasn''t helped. You may continue to take it into adulthood if your doctor thinks you''re benefitting from treatment. Lisdexamfetamine comes in capsule form, which you or your child usually take once a day. Common side effects of lisdexamfetamine include: decreased appetite, which can lead to weight loss or poor weight gain aggression drowsiness dizziness headaches diarrhoea nausea and vomiting Atomoxetine Atomoxetine works differently to other ADHD medications. It''s known as a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which means it increases the amount of a chemical in the brain called noradrenaline. This chemical passes messages between brain cells, and increasing the amount can aid concentration and help control impulses. Atomoxetine can be used by teenagers and children over the age of six. It''s also licensed for use in adults if symptoms of ADHD are confirmed. Atomoxetine comes in capsule form, which you or your child usually take once or twice a day. Common side effects of atomoxetine include: a small increase in blood pressure and heart rate nausea and vomiting stomach aches trouble sleeping dizziness headaches irritability Atomoxetine has also been linked to some more serious side effects that it''s important to look out for, including suicidal thoughts and liver damage. If either you or your child begin to feel depressed or suicidal while taking this medication, speak to your doctor. Guanfacine Guanfacine acts on part of the brain to improve attention and it also reduces blood pressure. It''s used for ADHD in teenagers and children if other medicines are unsuitable or ineffective. Guanfacine is usually taken as a tablet once a day, in the morning or evening. Common side effects include: tiredness or fatigue headache abdominal pain dry mouth Therapy As well as taking medication, different therapies can be useful in treating ADHD in children, teenagers and adults. Therapy is also effective in treating additional problems, such as conduct or anxiety disorders, that may appear with ADHD. Some of the therapies that may be used are outlined below. Psychoeducation Psychoeducation means that you or your child will be encouraged to discuss ADHD and how it affects you. It can help children, teenagers and adults make sense of being diagnosed with ADHD, and can help you to cope and live with the condition. Behaviour therapy Behaviour therapy provides support for carers of children with ADHD, and may involve teachers as well as parents. Behaviour therapy usually involves behaviour management, which uses a system of rewards to encourage your child to try to control their ADHD. If your child has ADHD, you can identify types of behaviour you want to encourage, such as sitting at the table to eat. Your child is then given some sort of small reward for good behaviour, and removal of a privilege for poor behaviour. For teachers, behaviour management involves learning how to plan and structure activities, and to praise and encourage children for even very small amounts of progress. Parent training and education programmes If your child has ADHD, specially tailored parent training and education programmes can help you learn specific ways of talking to your child, and playing and working with them to improve their attention and behaviour. You may also be offered parent training before your child is formally diagnosed with ADHD. These programmes are usually arranged in groups of around 10-12 parents. A programme usually consists of 10-16 meetings, which each last up to two hours. They aim to teach parents and carers about behaviour management (see above), while increasing confidence in your ability to help your child and improve your relationship.  Social skills training Social skills training involves your child taking part in role play situations, and aims to teach them how to behave in social situations by learning how their behaviour affects others. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave. A CBT therapist would try to change how your child feels about a situation, which would in turn potentially change their behaviour. CBT can be carried out with a therapist individually or in a group. Other possible treatments There are other ways of treating ADHD that some people with the condition find helpful, such as cutting out certain foods and taking supplements. However, there''s no strong evidence these work, and they shouldn''t be attempted without medical advice. Diet People with ADHD should eat a healthy, balanced diet. Don''t cut out foods before seeking medical advice. Some people may notice a link between types of food and worsening ADHD symptoms. For example, sugar, food colourings and additives, and caffeine are often blamed for aggravating hyperactivity, and some people believe they have intolerances to wheat or dairy products, which may add to their symptoms. If this is the case, keep a diary of what you eat and drink, and what behaviour this causes. Discuss this with your GP, who may refer you to a dietitian (a healthcare professional who specialises in nutrition). Supplements Some studies have suggested that supplements of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids may be beneficial in people with ADHD, although the evidence supporting this is very limited. It''s advisable to talk to your GP before using any supplements, because some can react unpredictably with medication or make it less effective. You should also remember that some supplements shouldn''t be taken long term, as they can reach dangerous levels in your body. Tips for parents Be sure that your GP or specialist helps you understand the difference between ADHD and other problems your child may have. Think about who else needs to know about your child’s ADHD, such as their school or nursery. Find out the side effects of any medication your child takes and what you need to look out for. Getting to know people at local support groups can stop you feeling isolated and unable to cope.   For information on local support groups, contact Attention Deficit Disorder Information and Support Service (ADDISS) or call 020 8952 2800.   Read more about living with ADHD.

It''s often caused by your immune system attacking healthy body tissue. In most cases, glomerulonephritis doesn''t cause any noticeable symptoms and is often diagnosed when blood or urine tests are carried out for another reason. In severe cases, glomerulonephritis may cause visible blood in your urine or your urine may become frothy. Swelling of the legs or other parts of the body (oedema) can also develop. Having blood in your urine doesn''t mean that you definitely have glomerulonephritis, but you should see your GP so the cause can be investigated. Read more about the symptoms of glomerulonephritis and diagnosing glomerulonephritis. Why does glomerulonephritis happen? Glomerulonephritis is usually the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack healthy tissue in the kidneys. However, there are many cases where the exact cause is unknown. It can occur by itself or be part of a more general condition, such as vasculitis or lupus. Glomerulonephritis is sometimes short-lived (acute), but often lasts for a long time (chronic). Read more about the causes of glomerulonephritis.  How is glomerulonephritis treated? The recommended treatment will depend on the cause and severity of your condition. Mild cases may not need any treatment. Treatment can be as simple as making changes to your diet, such as eating less salt to reduce the strain on your kidneys. Medications to lower blood pressure, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, are commonly prescribed for glomerulonephritis because they help protect the kidneys. If the condition is caused by a problem with your immune system, medications called immunosuppressants may be used. Although treatment is effective in many cases, further problems can sometimes develop. These include high blood pressure, damage to other organs, chronic kidney disease and kidney failure. Read more about treating glomerulonephritis and the complications of glomerulonephritis. Information about you If you have glomerulonephritis, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. What do our kidneys do?

(284, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/HIV/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'HIV', 'HIV and AIDS - NHS Choices', 'HIV and AIDS  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system, and weakens your ability to fight infections and disease. It''s most commonly caught by having sex without a condom. It can also be passed on by sharing infected needles and other injecting equipment, and from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. The virus attacks the immune system, and weakens your ability to fight infections and disease. There is no cure for HIV, but there are treatments to enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life. AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection, when your body can no longer fight life-threatening infections. With early diagnosis and effective treatment, most people with HIV will not go on to develop AIDS. How do you get HIV? HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person, which includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood, and breast milk. It is a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long. HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat or urine. The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is by anal or vaginal sex without a condom. According to statistics from Public Health England, 95% of those diagnosed with HIV in the UK in 2013 acquired HIV as a result of sexual contact. Other ways of getting HIV include: using a contaminated needle, syringe or other injecting equipment transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding It''s also possible for HIV to spread through oral sex and sharing sex toys, although the chances of this happening are very low. For example, it''s estimated that you only have a 1 in 5,000 chance of getting HIV if you give unprotected oral sex to someone with the infection. Read more about what causes HIV. Getting tested for HIV Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV. The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection. It''s important to be aware that: emergency anti-HIV medication called PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) may stop you becoming infected if started within three days of possible exposure to the virus, and starting it as soon as possible is recommended an early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the condition HIV tests may need to be repeated one to three months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the "window period"), but you shouldn''t wait this long to seek help you can get tested in a number of places, including your GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities such as the find HIV testing services near you  clinic tests can sometimes give you a result in minutes, although it may take a few days to get the result of a more detailed blood test home-testing or home-sampling kits are available to buy or order online or from pharmacies – depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result. If this is positive, you''ll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options. Read more about diagnosing HIV. Treating and living with HIV Although there is no cure for HIV, treatments are now very effective, enabling people with HIV to live long and healthy lives. Medication, known as antiretrovirals, work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These medicines come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day. HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV drug very easily, but taking a combination of different drugs makes this much less likely. Most people with HIV take a combination of three antiretrovirals and it is vital that the medications are taken every day as recommended by your doctor. For people living with HIV, taking effective antiretroviral therapy (where the HIV virus is "undetectable" in blood tests) will significantly reduce the risk of passing on HIV to sexual partners. It is rare for a pregnant woman living with HIV to transmit it to their babies, provided they receive timely and effective antiretroviral therapy and medical care. You will also be encouraged to take regular exercise, eat a healthy diet, stop smoking and have yearly flu jabs to minimise the risk of getting serious illnesses. Without treatment, the immune system will become severely damaged and life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and severe infections can occur. This is known as late-stage HIV infection or AIDS. Read more about living with HIV. Preventing HIV Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection. The best way to prevent HIV is to use a condom for sex and to never share needles or other injecting equipment (including syringes, spoons and swabs). Knowing your HIV status and that of your partner is also important. For people with HIV, effective antiretroviral therapy significantly reduces the risk of passing HIV to sexual partners. How common is HIV? At the end of 2014, there were an estimated 103,700 people in the UK living with HIV. The majority were infected through sex (43,000 gay and bisexual men and 54,100 heterosexuals). An estimated 17% of people with HIV (18,100) do not know they are infected. Around one in every 620 people in the UK has HIV, but the two groups with highest rates of HIV are gay and bisexual men (approximately 1 in 20) and Black African heterosexuals (approximately 1 in 56 men and 1 in 22 women). The World Health Organization estimates that around 35 million people in the world are living with HIV. The virus is more common in many sub-Saharan African countries.

This is followed a few days later by the measles rash. For most people, the illness lasts around 7 to 10 days in total. Initial symptoms The initial symptoms of measles can include: a runny or blocked nose sneezing watery eyes swollen eyelids sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40C (104F) small greyish-white spots in the mouth (see below) aches and pains a cough loss of appetite tiredness, irritability and a general lack of energy Spots in the mouth A day or two before the rash appears, many people with measles develop small greyish-white spots in their mouth. Not everyone with measles has these spots, but if someone has them in addition to the other symptoms listed above or a rash, it''s highly likely they have the condition. The spots will usually last for a few days. The measles rash The measles rash appears around two to four days after the initial symptoms and normally fades after about a week. You''ll usually feel most ill on the first or second day after the rash develops. The rash: is made up of small red-brown, flat or slightly raised spots that may join together into larger blotchy patches usually first appears on the head or neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body is slightly itchy for some people can look similar to other childhood conditions, such as slapped cheek syndrome, roseola or rubella is unlikely to be caused by measles if the person has been fully vaccinated (had two doses of the MMR vaccine) or had measles before You can use the childhood conditions slideshow to compare measles with some similar childhood rashes. When to seek medical advice Contact your GP as soon as possible if you suspect that you or your child has measles, even if you''re not completely sure. It''s best to phone before your visit, as your GP surgery may need to make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others. You should also see your GP if you''ve been in close contact with someone who has measles and you''ve not been fully vaccinated or haven''t had the infection before – even if you don''t have any symptoms yet.

Symptoms Chickenpox is a mild infectious disease that most children catch at some time. It starts with feeling unwell, a rash and, usually, a fever. Spots develop, which are red and become fluid-filled blisters within a day or two. They eventually dry into scabs, which drop off. The spots first appear on the chest, back, head or neck, then spread. They don''t leave scars unless they''re badly infected or picked. What to do You don''t need to go to your GP or accident and emergency (A&E) department unless you''re unsure whether it''s chickenpox, or your child is very unwell or distressed. Give your child plenty to drink. Use the recommended dose of paracetamol to relieve any fever or discomfort. Ibuprofen isn''t recommended for children who have chickenpox as, in rare cases, it can cause skin complications. Taking baths, wearing loose, comfortable clothes and using calamine lotion can all ease the itchiness. Try to discourage or distract your child from scratching, as this will increase the risk of scarring. Keeping their nails short will help. Let your child''s school or nursery know they are ill, in case other children are at risk. Keep your child away from anyone who is pregnant or trying to get pregnant. If your child had contact with a pregnant woman just before they became unwell, let the woman know about the chickenpox and suggest that she sees her GP or midwife. For women who have never had chickenpox, catching the illness in pregnancy can cause miscarriage, or the baby may be born with chickenpox. For more information, see our page on chickenpox. Measles Incubation period: 7 to 12 days Infectious period: From around 4 days before the rash appears until 4 days after it''s gone. Symptoms Measles begins like a bad cold and cough with sore, watery eyes. Your child will become gradually more unwell, with a fever. A rash appears after the third or fourth day. The spots are red and slightly raised. They may be blotchy, but not itchy. The rash begins behind the ears and spreads to the face and neck, then the rest of the body. The illness usually lasts about a week. Measles is much more serious than chickenpox, german measles, or mumps. It''s best prevented by the MMR vaccination. Serious complications include pneumonia and death. What to do Make sure your child gets plenty of rest and plenty to drink. Warm drinks will ease the cough. Give them paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve the fever and discomfort. Put Vaseline around their lips to protect their skin. If their eyelids are crusty, gently wash them with warm water. If your child is having trouble breathing, has a seizure, is coughing a lot or seems drowsy, seek urgent medical advice. For more information, read see our page on measles. Mumps Incubation period: 14 to 25 days Infectious period: From a few days before starting to feel unwell until a few days afterwards. Symptoms A general feeling of being unwell. A high temperature. Pain and swelling on the side of the face (in front of the ear) and under the chin. Swelling usually begins on one side, followed by the other side, though not always.  Discomfort when chewing. Your child''s face will be back to normal size in about a week. It''s rare for mumps to affect boys'' testes (balls) – this happens more often in adult men with mumps. If you think your child''s testes are swollen or painful, see your GP. What to do Give your child paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease pain in the swollen glands. Check the pack for the correct dosage. Give your child plenty to drink, but not fruit juices, as they make the saliva flow, which can worsen your child''s pain. There''s no need to see your GP, unless your child has other symptoms, such as a severe headache, vomiting, rash or, in boys, swollen testes. Mumps can be prevented by the MMR vaccine. See our page on mumps for more information. Slapped cheek disease (also known as fifth disease or parvovirus B19) Incubation period: 1 to 20 days Infectious period: A few days before the rash appears. Children are no longer contagious when the rash appears. Symptoms It begins with a fever and nasal discharge. A bright red rash, like the mark left by a slap, appears on the cheeks. Over the next two to four days, a lacy rash spreads to the trunk and limbs. Children with blood disorders such as spherocytosis or sickle cell disease may become more anaemic. They should seek medical care. What to do Make sure your child rests and drinks plenty of fluids.  Give them paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve any discomfort and fever. Pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant should see their GP or midwife as soon as possible if they come into contact with the infection or develop a rash. Go to our page on slapped cheek syndrome for more information. German measles (rubella) Incubation period: 15 to 20 days Infectious period: From one week before symptoms develop until up to four days after the rash appeared. Symptoms It starts like a mild cold. A rash appears in a day or two, first on the face, then on the body. The spots are flat and are pale pink on light skin. Glands in the back of the neck may be swollen. Your child won''t usually feel unwell. It can be difficult to diagnose rubella with certainty. What to do Give your child plenty to drink. Give them paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve any discomfort or fever. Keep them away from anybody who''s in the early stages of pregnancy (up to four months) or trying to get pregnant. If your child has had contact with any pregnant women before you knew about the illness, you must let the women know, as they''ll need to see their GP. Rubella can be prevented by the MMR vaccine. For more information, go visit our page on rubella. Whooping cough Incubation period: 6 to 21 days Infectious period: From the first signs of the illness until about three weeks after coughing starts. If an antibiotic is given, the infectious period will continue for up to five days after starting treatment.  Antibiotics need to be given early in the course of the illness to improve symptoms. Symptoms The symptoms are similar to a cold and cough, with the cough gradually getting worse. After about two weeks, coughing fits start. These are exhausting and make it difficult to breathe. Younger children (babies under six months) are much more seriously affected and can have breath-holding or blue attacks, even before they develop a cough. Your child may choke and vomit. Sometimes, but not always, there will be a whooping noise as the child draws in breath after coughing. The coughing fits may continue for several weeks, and can go on for up to three months. What to do Whooping cough is best prevented through immunisation. If your child has a cough that gets worse rather than better, and starts to have longer fits of coughing more often, see your GP. It''s important for the sake of other children to know whether or not your child has whooping cough. Talk to your GP about how to look after your child. Avoid contact with babies, who are most at risk from serious complications. Whooping cough can be prevented by childhood vaccinations. For more information, go to our page on whooping cough.

(287, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/swollen-glands/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'swollen glands', 'Swollen glands - NHS Choices', 'Swollen glands  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Swollen lymph glands are usually a sign of infection and tend to go down when you recover. However, they can sometimes have a more serious cause and may need to be seen by a doctor. Lymph glands (also called lymph nodes) are pea-sized lumps of tissue that contain white blood cells. These help to fight bacteria, viruses and anything else that causes infection. They are an important part of the immune system and are found throughout the body. The glands can swell to more than a few centimetres in response to infection or disease. Swollen glands, known medically as lymphadenopathy, may be felt under the chin or in the neck, armpits or groin, where they can be found in larger clumps. Many different types of infection can cause swollen glands, such as a cold or glandular fever. Less commonly, swollen glands may be caused by a non-infectious condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or even cancer. When to see your GP See your GP if you have swollen glands and: they haven''t gone down within a few weeks or are getting bigger they feel hard or don’t move when you press them you also have a sore throat and find it difficult to swallow or breathe you also have unexplained weight loss, night sweats or a persistent high temperature (fever) you don''t have an obvious infection and don''t feel unwell If necessary, your GP may request some tests to help identify the cause. These can include blood tests, an ultrasound scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan, and/or a biopsy (where a small sample of fluid is taken from the swelling and tested). Common causes of swollen glands Swollen glands are usually caused by a relatively minor viral or bacterial infection, including: a cold tonsillitis glandular fever a throat infection an ear infection a dental abscess cellulitis (a skin infection) The glands in the affected area will often become suddenly tender or painful. You may also have additional symptoms, such as a sore throat, cough, or fever. These infections usually clear up on their own, and the swollen glands will soon go down. You will normally just need to drink plenty of fluids, rest and relieve the symptoms at home using over-the-counter medicines such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. See your GP if your symptoms don''t improve within a few weeks. Less common causes of swollen glands Less often, swollen glands may be the result of: rubella – a viral infection that causes a red-pink skin rash made up of small spots measles – a highly infectious viral illness that causes distinctive red or brown spots on the skin   cytomegalovirus (CMV) – a common virus spread through bodily fluids, such as saliva and urine tuberculosis (TB) – a bacterial infection spread that causes a persistent cough  syphilis – a bacterial infection usually caught by having sex with someone who is infected cat scratch disease – a bacterial infection caused by a scratch from an infected cat HIV – a virus that attacks the immune system and weakens your ability to fight infections lupus – where the immune system starts to attack the body''s joints, skin, blood cells and organs rheumatoid arthritis – where the immune system starts to attack the tissue lining the joints sarcoidosis – where small patches of red and swollen tissue, called granulomas, develop in the organs of the body Click on the links above for more information on these conditions. Could it be cancer? Occasionally, swollen glands can be a sign of cancer that has started elsewhere in the body and spread to the lymph nodes, or a type of cancer affecting the white blood cells, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

It can be life-threatening and requires urgent treatment in hospital. Anyone can be affected, but the very young and very old are most at risk. This page covers: Symptoms Causes Treatments Recovery and complications Prevention Symptoms of encephalitis Encephalitis sometimes starts off with flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature and headache, but these don''t always occur. More serious symptoms develop over hours, days or weeks, including: confusion or disorientation seizures (fits) changes in personality and behaviour difficulty speaking weakness or loss of movement in some parts of the body loss of consciousness Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has these more serious symptoms. Read more about the symptoms of encephalitis and how encephalitis is diagnosed. Causes of encephalitis It''s not always clear what causes encephalitis, but it can be caused by: viral infections – several common viruses can spread to the brain and cause encephalitis in rare cases, including the herpes simplex virus (which causes cold sores and genital herpes) and the chickenpox virus a problem with the immune system (the body''s defence against infection) – sometimes something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks the brain, causing it to become inflamed bacterial or fungal infections – these are much rarer causes of encephalitis than viral infections Some types of encephalitis are spread by mosquitoes (such as Japanese encephalitis), ticks (such as tick-borne encephalitis) and mammals (such as rabies). You can''t catch encephalitis from someone else. Read more about the causes of encephalitis. Treatments for encephalitis Encephalitis needs to be treated in a hospital. The earlier treatment is started, the more successful it''s likely to be. Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but may include: antiviral medication steroid injections treatments to help control the immune system  antibiotics or antifungal medication painkillers to reduce discomfort or a fever medication to control seizures (fits) support with breathing, such as oxygen through a face mask or a breathing machine (ventilator) How long someone with encephalitis needs to stay in hospital can range from a few days to several weeks or even months. Read more about how encephalitis is treated. Recovering from encephalitis Some people will eventually make a full recovery from encephalitis, although this can be a long and frustrating process. But many people never make a full recovery and are left with long-term problems due to damage to their brain. Common complications include: memory loss  frequent seizures personality and behavioural changes problems with attention, concentration, planning and problem solving   persistent tiredness These problems can have a significant impact on the life of the affected person, as well as their family and friends. But help and support is available. Read more about the complications of encephalitis. Preventing encephalitis It''s not always possible to prevent encephalitis, but some of the infections that cause it can be prevented with vaccinations. These include the: MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine – a routine vaccination offered to all children in England Japanese encephalitis vaccine – recommended for travellers to at-risk areas, such as parts of Asia tick-borne encephalitis vaccine – recommended for travellers to certain parts of Europe (but not the UK) and Asia rabies vaccination – recommended for travellers to at-risk areas where access to medical care is likely to be limited Speak to your GP if you''re not sure whether your vaccinations are up to date, or you''re planning to travel abroad and don''t know if you need any vaccinations.

The main symptom of scabies is intense itching that''s worse at night. It also causes a skin rash on areas where the mites have burrowed. Read more about the symptoms of scabies. Scabies mites Scabies mites are called Sarcoptes scabiei. They feed using their mouths and front legs to burrow into the outer layer of skin (epidermis), where they lay eggs. After three to four days, the baby mites (larvae) hatch and move to the surface of the skin, where they mature into adults. Scabies like warm places, such as skin folds, between the fingers, under fingernails, or around the buttock or breast creases. They can also hide under watch straps, bracelets or rings. Read more about the life cycle of the scabies mite. How scabies is spread Scabies is usually spread through prolonged periods of skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, or through sexual contact. It''s also possible – but rare – for scabies to be passed on by sharing clothing, towels and bedding with someone who''s infected. It can take up to eight weeks for the symptoms of scabies to appear after the initial infection. This is known as the incubation period. Read more about the causes of scabies. Scabies outbreaks Scabies is widespread in densely populated areas with limited access to medical care, and is most common in the following tropical and subtropical areas: Africa Central and South America northern and central Australia Caribbean Islands India southeast Asia In developed countries, scabies outbreaks can sometimes occur in places where there are lots of people, such as schools, nurseries and care homes. In the UK, most outbreaks of scabies occur in the winter. This may be because people tend to spend more time indoors and closer to each other at this time of year. It''s difficult to know exactly how many cases of scabies there are in the UK. This is because many people don''t visit their GP and treat the condition with non-prescription medicines. Treating scabies Visit your GP if you think you have scabies. It''s not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated. The two most widely used treatments for scabies are permethrin cream and malathion lotion (brand name Derbac M). Both medications contain insecticides that kill the scabies mite. Permethrin 5% cream is usually recommended as the first treatment. Malathion 0.5% lotion is used if permethrin is ineffective. If your partner has been diagnosed with genital scabies, to avoid reinfection you should visit your nearest sexual health clinic so you can be checked and, if necessary, treated. Avoid having sex and other forms of close bodily contact until both you and your partner have completed the full course of treatment. Read more about diagnosing scabies and treating scabies. Complications of scabies Scabies can sometimes lead to a secondary skin infection if your skin becomes irritated and inflamed through excessive itching. Crusted scabies is a rare but more severe form of scabies, where a large number of mites are in the skin. This can develop in older people and those with a lowered immunity.

Nits are the empty egg cases attached to hair that head lice hatch from. Head lice are a common problem, particularly in school children aged 4-11. They''re largely harmless, but can live in the hair for a long time if not treated and can be irritating and frustrating to deal with. This page covers: Spotting head lice Getting rid of head lice and nits How you get head lice Prevention How to spot head lice Head lice can be difficult to spot, even when the head is closely inspected. They''re very small whitish or grey-brown insects that range from the size of a pinhead to the size of a sesame seed. The only way to be sure someone has head lice is to find a live louse by combing their hair with a special fine-toothed comb. This is called detection combing. Less reliable signs of head lice include: small white eggs or nits (egg cases) in the hair behind the ears or at back of the neck – see image above an itchy scalp a rash on the back of the neck feeling as though something is moving in the hair How to get rid of head lice and nits Treatments to get rid of head lice are available to buy from pharmacies, supermarkets and online. You don''t usually need to see your GP. The main treatments are: lotions or sprays that kill head lice – these can be very effective, but some aren''t suitable for pregnant or breastfeeding women, or for children under two removing head lice with a specially designed comb – this is suitable for everyone and relatively inexpensive, but needs to be repeated several times and can take a long time to do thoroughly A pharmacist can advise you about the treatments available if you''re not sure which is best for you or your child. Make sure you carefully follow the instructions that come with the treatment you choose. Read more about the treatments for head lice. How you get head lice Head lice are spread by direct head to head contact. They climb from one person''s hair to another''s. Head lice: can''t fly, jump or swim are very unlikely to be spread by objects such as hats, combs and pillows don''t have a preference for dirty, clean, short or long hair only affect people and can''t be caught from animals Once detached from the hair, head lice will usually die within 12-24 hours. Preventing head lice It''s very difficult to prevent head lice. You may want to consider regular detection combing – for example, on a weekly basis – if you''re concerned about your children or yourself. Lotions and sprays don''t prevent head lice and should only be used if a live louse has been found in your or your child''s hair. Staying off work or school and washing clothing and bedding on a hot wash is unnecessary, as it''s unlikely to help prevent the spread of head lice.

Should my doctor give my child antibiotics? (from 6 months) Media last reviewed: 01/05/2015 Next review due: 01/05/2017 Medicines aren''t always needed for childhood illnesses. Most illnesses get better by themselves, and make your child stronger and able to resist similar illnesses in the future. Painkillers for children Paracetamol and ibuprofen are often used to relieve the discomfort caused by a high temperature. Some children, such as those with asthma, may not be able to take ibuprofen, so check with your pharmacist, GP or health visitor. Both paracetamol and ibuprofen are safe and effective. Always have one or both stored in a safe place at home. Don''t give aspirin to children under 16 unless it''s specifically prescribed by a doctor. It has been linked with a rare but dangerous illness called Reye''s syndrome. If you''re breastfeeding, ask your health visitor, midwife or GP for advice before taking aspirin. Paracetamol for children Paracetamol can be given to children over two months old for pain and fever. Make sure you''ve got the right strength for your child. Overdosing is dangerous. Check with your pharmacist when you buy it, and read the label carefully. Ibuprofen for children Ibuprofen can be given for pain and fever in children of three months and over who weigh more than 5kg (11lbs). Check the correct dose for your child''s age. Avoid ibuprofen if your child has asthma, unless advised by your GP. Antibiotics for children Children don''t often need antibiotics. Most childhood infections are caused by viruses, and antibiotics only treat illnesses caused by bacteria, not viruses. If you''re offered a prescription, especially an antibiotic, talk to your GP about why it''s needed, how it will help, and whether there are any alternatives. Ask about any possible side effects – for example, whether it will make your child sleepy or irritable. If your child is prescribed antibiotics, always finish the whole course to make sure all the bacteria are killed off. Your child may seem better after two or three days, but if the course is five days, they must carry on taking the medicine. The illness is more likely to return if you don''t finish all the antibiotics. Child medicine dosages Make sure you know how much and how often to give a medicine. Writing it in your child''s Personal Child Health Record (PCHR, or red book) may help you remember. See Your baby''s health and development reviews for more information on the red book. If in doubt, check with your pharmacist or GP. Never give the medicine more frequently than recommended by your GP or pharmacist. With liquids, always measure out the right dose for your child''s age. The instructions will be on the bottle. Sometimes liquid medicine may have to be given using a special spoon or liquid medicine measure. This allows you to give small doses of medicine more accurately. Never use a kitchen teaspoon, as they vary in size. Ask your pharmacist or health visitor to explain how a measure should be used. Always read the manufacturer''s instructions supplied with the measure, and always give the exact dose stated on the medicine bottle. If in doubt, ask the pharmacist for help. If you buy medicines at the pharmacy: Always tell the pharmacist how old your child is. Some medicines are for adult use only. Always follow the instructions on the label or ask the pharmacist if you''re unsure. Ask for sugar-free medicines if they''re available. Look for the date stamp. Don''t use out-of-date medicines. If you have any out-of-date medicines at home, take them back to the pharmacy for safe disposal. Only give your child medicine given to you by your GP, pharmacist or usual healthcare professional. Never use medicines prescribed for anyone else. Keep all medicines out of your child''s reach and out of sight, if possible. The kitchen is a good place to keep medicines as it''s easy for you to keep an eye on them there. Put them in a place where they won''t get warm. Children and side effects from medicine If you think your child is reacting badly to a medicine – for example, with a rash or diarrhoea – stop giving it to them and speak to a health professional. If you''re worried that a symptom may be a side effect of a medicine: read the patient information leaflet supplied with the medicine – this lists the known side effects and advises you what to do call NHS 111, or speak to a pharmacist or your GP or practice nurse report the side effect through the Yellow Card Scheme – the scheme is run by the UK medicines watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA); Yellow Card reports are used as an early warning system to collect information on side effects and take necessary action to protect the public if there is a problem Keep a note of the medicine''s name in your child''s red book for future reference. Can you get over-the-counter children''s medicines for free? Some pharmacies run what''s known as a minor ailment scheme for specific ailments, such as coughs and colds and diarrhoea and vomiting. When pharmacies provide medicines as part of a minor ailment scheme, you get the medicines on the NHS. You won''t pay a prescription charge for children under 16. Not all pharmacies offer a minor ailment scheme and the ailments covered by the scheme vary from area to area. Read more about the minor ailments scheme.

(293, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/constipation-and-soiling.aspx', 'Constipation in children', 'Constipation in young children - Pregnancy and baby guide - NHS Choices', '', 'Constipation is common in childhood, particularly when children are being potty trained at around two to three years old. If your child doesn''t poo at least three times a week, and their poo is often hard and difficult to push out, they may be constipated. Their poo may be large, or it may look like "rabbit droppings" or little pellets. If your child is already potty trained, soiled pants can be another sign of constipation, as runny poo (diarrhoea) may leak out around the hard, constipated poo. This is called overflow soiling. If your child is constipated, they may find it painful to poo. This creates a vicious circle: the more it hurts, the more they hold back. The more constipated they get, the more it hurts. Even if pooing isn’t painful, once your child is really constipated, they will stop wanting to go to the toilet altogether. Why children get constipated Your child may be constipated because they are not eating enough high-fibre foods like fruit and veg, not drinking enough or have problems potty (or toilet) training. Constipation can also suggest that your child is worried or anxious about something. Their worry may be about a big change such as moving house, starting nursery or the arrival of a new baby. Find out about other causes of constipation in children. How to treat your child’s constipation Take your child to the GP if you think they may be constipated. The treatment that may be recommended for constipation will depend on your child’s age. Laxatives are often recommended for children who have been weaned, alongside diet and lifestyle changes. The longer your child is constipated, the more difficult it can be for them to get back to normal, so make sure you get help early. It may take several months for the treatments to work, but keep trying until they do. Remember that laxative treatment may make your child''s overflow soiling worse before it gets better. Getting constipated and soiling their clothes isn’t something your child is doing on purpose, so there’s no reason to get cross with them. You may both find the situation stressful, but staying calm and relaxed is the best attitude to help your child deal with the problem. Your health visitor can offer helpful tips. Preventing constipation Once your child’s constipation has been dealt with, it’s important to do everything you can to stop it coming back. Your GP may advise that your child keeps taking laxatives for a while to make sure their poo stays soft enough to push out regularly. Here are some more tips: Make sure your child has six to eight drinks a day – this includes breastfeeding and formula milk feeds. Give your child a variety of foods, including plenty of fruit and vegetables, which are a good source of fibre. Read about what to feed young children. Encourage your child to be physically active. For more information, read the physical activity guidelines for children aged under five years. Get your child into a routine of regularly sitting on the potty or toilet, after meals or before bed, and praise them whether or not they poo each time. This is particularly important for boys, who may forget about pooing once they are weeing standing up. Make sure your child can rest their feet flat on the floor or a step when they’re using the potty or toilet, to get them in a good position for pooing. The Education and Resources for Improving Childhood Continence (ERIC) guide to children’s bowel problems has a picture of this position. Ask them to tell you if they feel worried about using the potty or toilet – some children don’t want to poo in certain situations, such as at nursery. Stay calm and reassuring, so that your child doesn’t see going to the toilet as a stressful situation – you want your child to see pooing as a normal part of life, not something to be ashamed of. If you''d like advice on taking the stress out of going to the toilet, speak to your health visitor. More information and support You can contact ERIC for support. You can also call the helpline on 0845 370 8008 from Monday to Thursday 10am to 2pm, or email a question to helpline@eric.org.uk.

Bottle fed babies can also have drinks of water between feeds. Keep giving them formula at the usual strength – never water it down. Toddlers over one can have other drinks, such as full-fat cows'' milk, but avoid fruit juice and fizzy drinks as these can make diarrhoea worse. If your child is having solid foods, offer them food as usual if they seem to want it. If you wish, you can give your baby oral rehydration salt (ORS) solution to help prevent dehydration. This is available from your pharmacist. If you are worried about your child, you can speak to your GP, health visitor or pharmacist, or call NHS 111 for advice. When to get medical advice Vomiting usually lasts for 1-2 days, while diarrhoea lasts for about 5-7 days.

They will explain how to use it. The ORS solution helps replace the water and salts lost from your child''s body because of the diarrhoea and vomiting. To rehydrate your baby or toddler, you need to offer them small amounts of ORS solution frequently over a period of about four hours. If your child is breastfed, keep offering them breastfeeds as well. If your child isn''t breastfed, don''t offer them any other drinks apart from the ORS solution unless a health professional suggests it. Don''t offer your child any food while they are having the ORS solution. If your baby or toddler keeps vomiting the solution back up or won''t drink it, speak to your GP. Don''t give your child anti-diarrhoea drugs unless advised to by a health professional. Caring for your child once they''re rehydrated Once your child is rehydrated, they can start to eat solid food again. Offer them plenty of their usual drinks, including milk feeds, but avoid fruit juice or fizzy drinks. If your child has more episodes of diarrhoea you may be advised to give them some ORS solution after each bout. How to stop diarrhoea and vomiting spreading Make sure everyone in the family washes their hands frequently, preferably using liquid soap with warm running water. They also need to dry their hands properly. It''s particularly important for everyone to wash their hands after going to the toilet or changing a nappy and before eating. Anyone who has diarrhoea and vomiting should have their own towel to use.

There are many different types of Streptococci bacteria, and infections vary in severity from mild throat infections to life-threatening infections of the blood or organs. Most streptococcal infections can be treated with antibiotics. Streptococci are divided into two key groups: alpha-haemolytic – made up of two groups, including Streptococcus pneumoniae beta-haemolytic – made up of several groups, including Group A and Group B streptococci This topic focuses on Group A and Group B beta-haemolytic streptococci. Read about pneumococcal infections for information on infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Group A strep Group A strep (strep A) are often found on the surface of the skin and inside the throat. They are a common cause of infection in adults and children. They can be spread in droplets in the coughs or sneezes of someone with an infection, or through direct contact with an infected person or contaminated object. Minor strep A infections Most infections caused by strep A are unpleasant, but don''t pose a serious threat to your health. These include: throat infections (pharyngitis or "strep throat") and tonsillitis – which can cause a sore throat, swollen glands and discomfort when swallowing impetigo – a skin infection that can cause sores, blisters and crusts to develop on the skin cellulitis – an infection of the deeper layers of the skin, which can cause affected areas to quickly become red, painful, swollen and hot a middle ear infection – which often causes earache, a high temperature (fever) and some temporary hearing loss sinusitis – an infection of the small cavities behind the forehead and cheekbones, which causes a blocked or runny nose and a throbbing pain in your face scarlet fever – an infection that causes a widespread, fine pink-red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch Click on the links above for more information on these conditions. You should see your GP if you have persistent or severe symptoms of a strep A infection, as they may recommend a short course of antibiotics. Most people with a minor strep A infection will make a full recovery and experience no long-term problems, although there is a very small risk the infection could spread further into the body or lead to complications such as rheumatic fever if left untreated. Invasive strep A infections In rare cases, strep A bacteria can penetrate deeper inside the tissues and organs of the body, and become what''s known as an invasive infection. These infections are much rarer and usually affect certain groups of people, including babies, elderly people, people with diabetes, and people with weak immune systems (for example, because of cancer treatment or HIV). Examples of invasive infections include: pneumonia – an infection of the lungs that causes persistent coughing, breathing difficulties and chest pain sepsis – an infection of the blood that causes a fever, rapid heartbeat and rapid breathing meningitis – an infection of the protective outer layer of the brain that causes a severe headache, vomiting, stiff neck, sensitivity to light and a distinctive blotchy red rash toxic shock syndrome – where bacteria release toxins into the blood, which can cause a sudden high fever, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, fainting, dizziness and confusion necrotising fasciitis – an infection of the deeper layers of the skin, fat and covering of the muscle (fascia), which can cause severe pain, swelling and redness of the affected area that can spread very quickly Click on the links above for more information on these conditions. You should seek immediate medical advice if you think you may have an invasive strep A infection, as you will need to be treated with antibiotics as soon as possible. Although pneumonia is sometimes relatively mild, the overall outlook for more serious invasive strep A infections is poor. It''s estimated up to one in every four people who develop an invasive strep A infection will die from it. Group B strep Group B strep (strep B) usually live harmlessly inside the digestive system and in the vagina. Strep B can sometimes cause urinary tract infections (UTIs), skin infections, bone infections, blood infections and pneumonia, particularly in vulnerable people, such as the elderly and those with diabetes. Strep B in pregnancy It''s estimated around one in every four pregnant women have strep B bacteria in their vagina or digestive system. The bacteria can sometimes be passed on to the baby through the amniotic fluid (a clear liquid that surrounds and protects the unborn baby in the womb) or as the baby passes through the birth canal during labour. Most babies exposed to strep B will be unaffected, but in around 1 in every 2,000 cases they can become infected. A strep B infection during pregnancy can also cause miscarriage or stillbirth, but this is rare. Strep B in newborn babies As newborn babies have a poorly developed immune system, strep B bacteria can quickly spread through their body, causing serious infections such as meningitis and pneumonia. The symptoms of a strep B infection in a newborn baby usually develop within the first few hours or days of giving birth, and include: being floppy and unresponsive poor feeding grunting when breathing irritability an unusually high or low temperature unusually fast or slow breathing an unusually fast or slow heart rate In some cases, a baby can pick up a strep B infection a few weeks or months after birth. It''s not known exactly why this happens, but it''s not related to infection during birth. Symptoms of a late-onset group B strep infection can include a fever, poor feeding, vomiting and reduced consciousness. You should seek immediate medical advice if you think your baby may have a group B strep infection. Preventing and treating strep B infections in babies It''s possible to reduce the chances of a baby becoming infected with strep B by identifying cases where there is a risk of the bacteria being passed from a mother to their child and giving the mother antibiotics directly into a vein (intravenously) during labour. Known risk factors that may mean you need intravenous antibiotics during labour include: you have previously given birth to a baby with a strep B infection strep B is found in your urine during tests carried out for other purposes strep B is found during vaginal and rectal swabs carried out for other purposes you have a fever during labour you go into labour prematurely (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) If your baby develops symptoms of a strep B infection after they''re born, they will have tests to confirm the diagnosis and will be given intravenous antibiotics as soon as possible. Most babies who become infected can be treated successfully and will make a full recovery, although there is chance they could die as a result of complications such as meningitis. Some babies who survive are left with permanent problems, such as hearing loss, vision loss, and problems with memory and concentration.

They work by killing bacteria or preventing them from reproducing and spreading. Antibiotics aren''t effective against viral infections, such as the common cold, flu, most coughs and sore throats. Many mild bacterial infections can also be cleared by your immune system without using antibiotics, so they aren''t routinely prescribed. It''s important that antibiotics are prescribed and taken correctly to help prevent the progression of antibiotic resistance. This is when a strain of bacteria no longer responds to treatment with one or more types of antibiotics. When antibiotics are used Antibiotics may be used to treat bacterial infections that: are unlikely to clear up without antibiotics could infect others unless treated could take too long to clear without treatment carry a risk of more serious complications People at a high risk of infection may also be given antibiotics as a precaution, known as antibiotic prophylaxis. Read more about when antibiotics are used. How do I take antibiotics? Take antibiotics as directed on the packet or the patient information leaflet that comes with the medication, or as instructed by your GP or pharmacist. Doses of antibiotics can be provided in several ways: oral antibiotics – tablets, capsules or a liquid that you drink, which can be used to treat most types of mild to moderate infections in the body topical antibiotics – creams, lotions, sprays or drops, which are often used to treat skin infections injections of antibiotics – these can be given as an injection or infusion through a drip directly into the blood or muscle, and are usually reserved for more serious infections It''s essential to finish taking a prescribed course of antibiotics, even if you feel better, unless a healthcare professional tells you otherwise. If you stop taking an antibiotic part way through a course, the bacteria can become resistant to the antibiotic. Missing a dose of antibiotics If you forget to take a dose of your antibiotics, take that dose as soon as you remember and then continue to take your course of antibiotics as normal. But if it''s almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Don''t take a double dose to make up for a missed one. There''s an increased risk of side effects if you take two doses closer together than recommended. Accidentally taking an extra dose Accidentally taking one extra dose of your antibiotic is unlikely to cause you any serious harm. But it will increase your chances of experiencing side effects, such as pain in your stomach, diarrhoea, and feeling or being sick. If you accidentally take more than one extra dose of your antibiotic, are worried or experiencing severe side effects, speak to your GP or call NHS 111 as soon as possible. Side effects of antibiotics As with any medication, antibiotics can cause side effects. Most antibiotics don''t cause problems if they''re used properly and serious side effects are rare. The most common side effects include: being sick feeling sick bloating and indigestion diarrhoea Some people may have an allergic reaction to antibiotics, especially penicillin and a type called cephalosporins. In very rare cases, this can lead to a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which is a medical emergency. Read more about the side effects of antibiotics. Considerations and interactions Some antibiotics aren''t suitable for people with certain medical conditions, or women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. You should only ever take antibiotics prescribed for you – never "borrow" them from a friend or family member. Some antibiotics can also react unpredictably with other medications, such as the oral contraceptive pill and alcohol. It''s important to read the information leaflet that comes with your medication carefully and discuss any concerns with your pharmacist or GP. Read more about: things to consider before taking antibiotics how antibiotics interact with other medicines Types of antibiotics There are hundreds of different types of antibiotics, but most of them can be broadly classified into six groups. These are outlined below. penicillins (such as penicillin and amoxicillin) – widely used to treat a variety of infections, including skin infections, chest infections and urinary tract infections cephalosporins (such as cephalexin) – used to treat a wide range of infections, but some are also effective for treating more serious infections, such as septicaemia and meningitis aminoglycosides (such as gentamicin and tobramycin) – tend to only be used in hospital to treat very serious illnesses such as septicaemia, as they can cause serious side effects, including hearing loss and kidney damage; they''re usually given by injection, but may be given as drops for some ear or eye infections tetracyclines (such as tetracycline and doxycycline)– can be used to treat a wide range of infections, but are commonly used to treat moderate to severe acne and rosacea macrolides (such as erythromycin and clarithromycin) – can be particularly useful for treating lung and chest infections, or an alternative for people with a penicillin allergy, or to treat penicillin-resistant strains of bacteria fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) – broad-spectrum antibiotics that can be used to treat a wide range of infections Antibiotic resistance Both the NHS and health organisations across the world are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics, especially for conditions that aren''t serious. The overuse of antibiotics in recent years means they''re becoming less effective and has led to the emergence of "superbugs". These are strains of bacteria that have developed resistance to many different types of antibiotics, including: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)  Clostridium difficile (C. diff) the bacteria that cause multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) These types of infections can be serious and challenging to treat, and are becoming an increasing cause of disability and death across the world. The biggest worry is that new strains of bacteria may emerge that can''t be effectively treated by any existing antibiotics.

You may have heard them referred to as "staph infections". Staph bacteria can cause a wide range of infections, from relatively minor skin infections such as boils, to more serious infections of the blood, lungs and heart. There are many types of Staphylococci, but most infections are caused by a group called Staphylococcus aureus. This group of bacteria includes meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is resistant to certain antibiotics that are commonly used for staph infections, such as flucloxacillin. It also includes PVL-Staphylococcus aureus, which produces a toxin called Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), which kills infection-fighting white blood cells and can cause recurrent skin infections, such as boils and abscesses. This page covers some of the main types of staph infection, including information on how these infections are spread and treated. Types of staph infections Staph infections can be broadly classified into two groups: skin and soft tissue infections, and invasive infections. Examples are given below. Skin and soft tissue infections Most infections caused by staph bacteria are relatively minor and only affect the skin or underlying tissue. Common examples include: boils – red, painful lumps on the skin that usually develop on the neck, face, armpit or buttocks impetigo – a highly contagious skin infection that mainly affects children, which can cause sores, blisters and crusts to develop on the skin cellulitis – an infection of the deep layers of the skin, which can cause affected areas to quickly become red, painful, swollen and hot a skin abscess – a collection of pus that appears as a painful lump under the surface of the skin folliculitis – an infection of a hair follicle (small sac in the skin that a hair grows from), which causes an itchy pus-filled bump to develop  wound infections – an infection of a cut or graze or surgical wound, causing redness, swelling, pain and pus staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) – a more serious condition that mainly affects babies and young children, where staph bacteria release a toxin that damages the skin, leading to extensive blistering that looks like the skin has been scalded Click on the links above for more information on these conditions, including their symptoms and treatments. Invasive infections In a small number of people, a staph skin infection can lead to a more serious, invasive infection deeper within the body. Examples include: septic arthritis – a joint infection that causes pain, swelling, redness and tenderness in affected joints osteomyelitis – a bone infection, usually affecting one of the legs, causing bone pain, restricted movement, and swelling, redness and warmth in the affected area pneumonia – an infection of the lungs that causes persistent coughing, breathing difficulties and chest pain; this often occurs after a viral illness such as flu endocarditis – an infection of the inner lining of the heart, causing a fever, chest pain, coughing, weakness and shortness of breath sepsis – an infection of the blood that causes a high temperature (fever), rapid heartbeat and rapid breathing toxic shock syndrome – where bacteria release toxins into the blood, which can cause a sudden fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, fainting, dizziness, confusion and a rash Click on the links above for more information about these conditions, including their symptoms and treatments. How you get a staph infection Staph bacteria are common. About one person in every three carries the bacteria harmlessly on their skin, usually inside their nose and on the surface of their armpits and buttocks. However, the bacteria can cause problems if they enter the body through a break in the skin, such as a cut or graze, burn or insect bite. They can also get into your body via medical equipment, such as urinary catheters, openings in the skin where drips are inserted and feeding tubes. Staph bacteria are usually spread between people through close skin contact or by sharing contaminated objects, such as towels or toothbrushes. Occasionally, they can be spread in droplets in the coughs and sneezes of someone carrying the bacteria. Eating food contaminated with staph bacteria can give you food poisoning. This normally develops after eating food, usually meat, that hasn''t been cooked or stored properly. Who is affected Staph skin infections are common, particularly among children, teenagers and young adults. Invasive infections are much rarer. Both types of infection can affect healthy people, but more serious infections tend to affect those who: have a weakened immune system because of an underlying medical condition or a side effect of treatment, such as chemotherapy  use medical equipment that goes directly inside their body, such as a urinary catheter have experienced severe trauma to the skin, such as a deep wound or a major burn Treating staph infections Some minor staph infections, including minor boils and food poisoning, don''t need specific treatment and will get better on their own within a few days or weeks. In some cases, antibiotic tablets or creams may be recommended to treat the infection, and you may need a minor procedure to drain any pus from under your skin, using a needle or scalpel. Until the infection clears up, you should take precautions to avoid spreading the infection to other people. These include washing your hands regularly, not sharing objects that could become contaminated, regularly cleaning any pus off your skin, and covering the infected area with a dressing or plaster. Invasive staphylococcal infections will often require treatment in hospital, because your body''s functions may need to be supported while the infection is treated. The infection will usually be treated with antibiotic injections for several days. Preventing staph infections You can reduce your chances of developing staph infections by: washing your hands with soap and warm water regularly – particularly if you come into contact with someone who has a staph skin infection keeping your skin clean by having a bath or shower every day keeping any cuts clean and covered not sharing towels, washcloths, bed linen, toothbrushes and razors ensuring that food is both properly cooked and properly chilled – read more about preventing food poisoning If you experience repeated staph infections and you''re found to carry the bacteria on your skin, your doctor may recommend using antibacterial shampoo and nasal cream to kill the bacteria and reduce the risk of further infections.

There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes – where the body''s immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin type 2 diabetes – where the body doesn''t produce enough insulin, or the body''s cells don''t react to insulin Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. In the UK, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2. During pregnancy, some women have such high levels of blood glucose that their body is unable to produce enough insulin to absorb it all. This is known as gestational diabetes. Pre-diabetes Many more people have blood sugar levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes. This is sometimes known as pre-diabetes. If your blood sugar level is above the normal range, your risk of developing full-blown diabetes is increased. It''s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it will get progressively worse if left untreated. When to see a doctor Visit your GP as soon as possible if you experience the main symptoms of diabetes, which include: feeling very thirsty urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired weight loss and loss of muscle bulk itching around the penis or vagina, or frequent episodes of thrush cuts or wounds that heal slowly blurred vision Type 1 diabetes can develop quickly over weeks or even days. Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because the early symptoms tend to be general.

Causes of diabetes The amount of sugar in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach). When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it''s broken down to produce energy. However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there''s either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced doesn''t work properly. Although there are no lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes is often linked to being overweight. Read about how to reduce your diabetes risk. Living with diabetes If you''re diagnosed with diabetes, you''ll need to eat healthily, take regular exercise and carry out regular blood tests to ensure your blood glucose levels stay balanced. You can use the BMI healthy weight calculator to check whether you''re a healthy weight. People diagnosed with type 1 diabetes also require regular insulin injections for the rest of their life. As type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, medication may eventually be required, usually in the form of tablets. Read about:  Treating type 1 diabetes Treating type 2 diabetes Living with diabetes Diabetic eye screening Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year. If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it''s not treated. Screening, which involves a half-hour check to examine the back of the eyes, is a way of detecting the condition early so it can be treated more effectively. Read more about diabetic eye screening.

It is suitable for people with androgenetic alopecia (male- and female-pattern baldness) or scarring resulting from injury or burns. It is not usually appropriate for other types of hair loss, such as alopecia areata. A hair transplant isn''t normally available on the NHS, as it is regarded as cosmetic surgery. It is a major decision – a permanent alteration to your appearance – so weigh it up carefully and don''t rush into anything. You may want to read Is cosmetic surgery right for me? before making your decision. Read on to find out: How much does it cost?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems  More information  How much does it cost? A hair transplant in the UK can cost anywhere between £1,000 and £30,000, depending on the extent of hair loss, the type of procedure you have, and the quality of the clinic and its team. Where do I go? If you''re looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform hair transplants.  All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC. The CQC publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. Also, research the surgeon who is going to carry our your hair transplant. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor''s fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many transplants they''ve performed where there have been complications what sort of care would be provided after the operation where the surgeon is based Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? A hair transplant is usually carried out under local anaesthetic and sedation. There are two main ways it can be carried out. Follicular unit transplantation (FUT, or strip method): A strip of hair-bearing skin is removed from the back and sides of the head and divided into individual hair grafts. Each graft contains about two hairs. The grafts are then placed into tiny cuts (incisions) made in the scalp. The wound at the back of the head is closed with stitches. The head does not need to be shaved – only the area to be removed is trimmed. Follicular unit extraction (FUE): The entire head is usually shaved. A special punch device is used to directly remove individual grafts of hair one by one. The grafts are placed into tiny incisions made in the scalp. Both procedures usually take a full day, but an overnight stay is not required. If a large area is being treated, you may need to have two or more sessions a few months apart. You shouldn''t feel pain during a hair transplant. Pain relief will be provided if you experience any discomfort afterwards. The surgeon may give you some lotion or spray to take away and use at home. It''s important to follow the instructions you''re given when discharged. Recovery You will need to arrange for someone to drive you home if you were given a sedative, as this can take up to 24 hours to wear off. Most patients return to work about three days after their hair transplant procedure. It''s usually possible to return to work more quickly following an FUT procedure. The head is not shaved, so your operation may not be noticeable. You should be very careful with your transplanted hair for the first 14 days after your operation. The newly transplanted grafts will not be secure in their new place. After 14 days, you can normally return to your normal hair care routine. Most clinics will ask you to restrict your exercise in the first month to reduce the chances of increased scarring. After a few days: Any bandages can normally be removed. You may be able to wash your hair gently by hand. After a week: Any non-dissolvable stitches can normally be removed. After a few weeks: The transplanted hair will often fall out, and later start to grow back. After six months: New hair will normally start to appear. After 12-18 months: The full results should be seen. Side effects to expect It''s common after a hair transplant to have: a tight, achy and swollen scalp for a few days temporary scabbing where the hair was transplanted at least one scar – although this should fade and is usually only noticeable if your hair is cut very short What could go wrong A hair transplant is generally a safe procedure, but as with any type of operation there''s always a small risk of: excessive bleeding infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic or sedation  Your surgeon should be able to treat these problems promptly if they happen. There''s also a small risk the transplant won''t take and the hair falls out, or an obvious scar develops. The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are and how they would be treated if they occured. If you have male- or female-pattern hair loss, your hair will continue to thin in the areas around the transplant, so it''s essential to carefully plan the design of the transplant to make sure the hair remains natural looking as time passes. Occasionally, people find the desired effect wasn''t achieved and feel they need another operation. What to do if you have problems Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms. If you have a hair transplant and are not happy with the results, or you think the procedure wasn''t carried out properly, you should take up the matter with the surgeon who treated you. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC).

Why chemotherapy is used Chemotherapy is used if a cancer has spread or if there''s a risk that it will. The main aim of treatment may be: to try to cure cancer completely – this is known as curative chemotherapy to help make other treatments more effective – for example, chemotherapy can be combined with radiotherapy (where radiation is used to kill cancerous cells), or it can be used before surgery to reduce the risk of the cancer returning after radiotherapy or surgery  to relieve symptoms – a cure may not be possible for advanced cancer, but chemotherapy may be used to relieve the symptoms and slow it down; this is known as palliative chemotherapy Less commonly, chemotherapy is used to treat non-cancerous conditions. For example, low doses have been used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. How chemotherapy is used There are many different types of chemotherapy medication, but they all work in much the same way. Depending on the type of cancer you have, you may be treated with one medicine (monotherapy) or with a combination of medicines (combination therapy). There are several ways in which chemotherapy medication can be given, including tablets and injections directly into a vein. The team caring for you will help come up with a treatment plan for your specific circumstances. Read more about how chemotherapy is carried out and who can use chemotherapy. Side effects Even though chemotherapy is often effective at treating cancer or relieving its symptoms, it does cause side effects. The medicines used in chemotherapy can''t distinguish between fast-growing cancer cells and other types of fast-growing cells, such as blood cells, skin cells and the cells inside the stomach. This means that most chemotherapy medications have a poisonous effect on the body''s cells, causing problems including: feeling tired and weak all the time feeling and being sick  hair loss  Some people only have minimal side effects, but for most people, a course of chemotherapy can be unpleasant and upsetting. Living with and adapting to the side effects of chemotherapy can be challenging. However, it''s important to realise that most, if not all, side effects will disappear once the treatment is complete. There is no risk of the side effects of chemotherapy being passed to other people, including children and pregnant women, if they are in close contact with someone having chemotherapy. Read more about the possible side effects of chemotherapy. Targeted therapies In the past, any medication used to treat cancer was regarded as chemotherapy. However, over the last 20 years, new types of medication that work in a different way to chemotherapy have been introduced. These new types of medication are known as targeted therapies. This is because they''re designed to target and disrupt one or more of the biological processes that cancerous cells use to grow and reproduce. In contrast, chemotherapy medications are designed to have a poisonous effect on cancerous cells.

(301, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Scars/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'scarring', 'Scars - NHS Choices', 'Scars  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  A scar is a mark that is left on the skin after a wound or an injury to the surface of the skin has healed. Scars are very common – most people have at least one on their body. They are a natural part of the healing process. Scars can occur inside and outside the body. For example, they can occur on the internal organs where a cut has been made during surgery, and can develop after certain skin conditions, such as acne and chicken pox. How do scars form? When the skin is wounded and there is a break in the body’s tissues, the body produces more of a protein called collagen, as part of the healing process. Collagen builds up where the tissue has been damaged, helping to heal and strengthen the wound. For a period of about three months or longer, new collagen continues to form and blood supply increases, causing the scar to become raised, lumpy and red. Some collagen then breaks down at the site of the wound, the blood supply reduces and the scar gradually becomes smoother, softer and paler. Although scars are permanent, they can fade over a period of up to two years. It is unlikely they will fade any more after this time. Skin wounds can be caused by many things, including: accidental injuries surgery burns and scalds intentional harm Read more about the causes of scars. Where do scars form? Scarring is unpredictable and varies from person to person. Certain areas of the body are more at risk of scarring, such as the chest, back, ear lobe and the shoulder. Scars that form on the knees and shoulders can appear stretched or widened as a result of the healing process occurring over movable joints. Types of scars The different types of scars include: Flat, pale scars – these are the most common type of scar and are due to the body''s natural healing process. Initially, they may be red or dark and raised after the wound has healed, but will become paler and flatter naturally over time. This can take up to two years. Hypertrophic scars – red, raised scars that form along a wound and can remain this way for a number of years. Keloid scars – these are caused by an excess of scar tissue produced at the site of the wound, where the scar grows beyond the boundaries of the original wound, even after it has healed. Pitted (atrophic or "ice-pick") scars – these have a sunken appearance. Contracture scars – these are caused by the skin shrinking and tightening, usually after a burn, which can restrict movement. Read more about the types of scars. Treating scars Depending on the type and age of a scar, a variety of different treatments may help make them less visible and improve their appearance. Scars are unlikely to disappear completely, although most will gradually fade over time. If scarring is unsightly, uncomfortable or restrictive, treatment options may include: silicone gel sheets pressure dressings corticosteroid injections cosmetic camouflage (make-up) surgery It is often the case that a combination of treatments can be used. Read more about treating scars. Emotional effects of scarring Scarring, particularly when it is on the face, can be very distressing, especially if you feel you are being stared at. If you avoid meeting people as a result of your appearance, you may become socially isolated. This can lead to feelings of depression. If you feel that your scars are making you depressed or affecting your daily activities, make sure you visit your GP. Preventing or improving scars It isn''t possible to prevent scars from forming, but there are things you can do to help your scar be less visible and heal better, such as immediately cleaning dirt, objects and dead tissue from wounds. Other ways to improve scarring include: not scratching or picking at scabs and spots covering wounds with a waterproof ointment (such as Vaseline) using silicone gels or sheets to reduce redness and encourage healing Scars: skin camouflage Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

They work by killing bacteria or preventing them from reproducing and spreading. Antibiotics aren''t effective against viral infections, such as the common cold, flu, most coughs and sore throats. Many mild bacterial infections can also be cleared by your immune system without using antibiotics, so they aren''t routinely prescribed. It''s important that antibiotics are prescribed and taken correctly to help prevent the progression of antibiotic resistance. This is when a strain of bacteria no longer responds to treatment with one or more types of antibiotics. When antibiotics are used Antibiotics may be used to treat bacterial infections that: are unlikely to clear up without antibiotics could infect others unless treated could take too long to clear without treatment carry a risk of more serious complications People at a high risk of infection may also be given antibiotics as a precaution, known as antibiotic prophylaxis. Read more about when antibiotics are used. How do I take antibiotics? Take antibiotics as directed on the packet or the patient information leaflet that comes with the medication, or as instructed by your GP or pharmacist. Doses of antibiotics can be provided in several ways: oral antibiotics – tablets, capsules or a liquid that you drink, which can be used to treat most types of mild to moderate infections in the body topical antibiotics – creams, lotions, sprays or drops, which are often used to treat skin infections injections of antibiotics – these can be given as an injection or infusion through a drip directly into the blood or muscle, and are usually reserved for more serious infections It''s essential to finish taking a prescribed course of antibiotics, even if you feel better, unless a healthcare professional tells you otherwise. If you stop taking an antibiotic part way through a course, the bacteria can become resistant to the antibiotic. Missing a dose of antibiotics If you forget to take a dose of your antibiotics, take that dose as soon as you remember and then continue to take your course of antibiotics as normal. But if it''s almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Don''t take a double dose to make up for a missed one. There''s an increased risk of side effects if you take two doses closer together than recommended. Accidentally taking an extra dose Accidentally taking one extra dose of your antibiotic is unlikely to cause you any serious harm. But it will increase your chances of experiencing side effects, such as pain in your stomach, diarrhoea, and feeling or being sick. If you accidentally take more than one extra dose of your antibiotic, are worried or experiencing severe side effects, speak to your GP or call NHS 111 as soon as possible. Side effects of antibiotics As with any medication, antibiotics can cause side effects. Most antibiotics don''t cause problems if they''re used properly and serious side effects are rare. The most common side effects include: being sick feeling sick bloating and indigestion diarrhoea Some people may have an allergic reaction to antibiotics, especially penicillin and a type called cephalosporins. In very rare cases, this can lead to a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which is a medical emergency. Read more about the side effects of antibiotics. Considerations and interactions Some antibiotics aren''t suitable for people with certain medical conditions, or women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. You should only ever take antibiotics prescribed for you – never "borrow" them from a friend or family member. Some antibiotics can also react unpredictably with other medications, such as the oral contraceptive pill and alcohol. It''s important to read the information leaflet that comes with your medication carefully and discuss any concerns with your pharmacist or GP. Read more about: things to consider before taking antibiotics how antibiotics interact with other medicines Types of antibiotics There are hundreds of different types of antibiotics, but most of them can be broadly classified into six groups. These are outlined below. penicillins (such as penicillin and amoxicillin) – widely used to treat a variety of infections, including skin infections, chest infections and urinary tract infections cephalosporins (such as cephalexin) – used to treat a wide range of infections, but some are also effective for treating more serious infections, such as septicaemia and meningitis aminoglycosides (such as gentamicin and tobramycin) – tend to only be used in hospital to treat very serious illnesses such as septicaemia, as they can cause serious side effects, including hearing loss and kidney damage; they''re usually given by injection, but may be given as drops for some ear or eye infections tetracyclines (such as tetracycline and doxycycline)– can be used to treat a wide range of infections, but are commonly used to treat moderate to severe acne and rosacea macrolides (such as erythromycin and clarithromycin) – can be particularly useful for treating lung and chest infections, or an alternative for people with a penicillin allergy, or to treat penicillin-resistant strains of bacteria fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) – broad-spectrum antibiotics that can be used to treat a wide range of infections Antibiotic resistance Both the NHS and health organisations across the world are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics, especially for conditions that aren''t serious. The overuse of antibiotics in recent years means they''re becoming less effective and has led to the emergence of "superbugs". These are strains of bacteria that have developed resistance to many different types of antibiotics, including: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)  Clostridium difficile (C. diff) the bacteria that cause multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) These types of infections can be serious and challenging to treat, and are becoming an increasing cause of disability and death across the world. The biggest worry is that new strains of bacteria may emerge that can''t be effectively treated by any existing antibiotics.

(303, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/scarlet-fever/pages/introduction.aspx', 'scarlet fever', 'Scarlet fever - NHS Choices', 'Scarlet fever  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Scarlet fever is a bacterial illness that mainly affects children. It causes a distinctive pink-red rash. The illness is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, also known as group A streptococcus, which are found on the skin and in the throat. Generally, scarlet fever is much less common than it used to be but in recent years there have been a number of significant outbreaks. For example, figures published by Public Health England show that from September 2013 to March 2014 there were 2,830 cases of scarlet fever. For the same period in 2014/15 a total of 5,746 cases were recorded. The reason for recent increase is unclear. It’s important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of scarlet fever so that early treatment with antibiotics can be given. Scarlet fever symptoms Scarlet fever usually follows a sore throat or a skin infection, such as impetigo, caused by particular strains of streptococcus bacteria. Initial symptoms usually include a sore throat, headache and a high temperature (38.3C/101F or above), flushed cheeks and a swollen tongue. A day or two later the characteristic pinkish rash appears. It usually occurs on the chest and stomach before spreading to other areas of the body, such as the ears and neck. The symptoms of scarlet fever usually develop two to five days after infection, although the incubation period (the period between exposure to the infection and symptoms appearing) can be as short as one day or as long as seven days. The rash feels like sandpaper to touch and it may be itchy. On darker skin the rash may be more difficult to see although its rough texture should be apparent. When to seek medical advice Scarlet fever usually clears up after about a week, but if you think you or your child may have it, see your GP for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Your GP should be able to diagnose scarlet fever by examining the distinctive rash and asking about other symptoms. They may also decide to take a sample of saliva from the back of the throat so it can be tested in a laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. There''s no evidence to suggest that catching scarlet fever when pregnant will put your baby at risk. However, if you''re heavily pregnant, tell the doctors and midwives in charge of your care if you''ve been in contact with someone who has scarlet fever. How scarlet fever spreads Scarlet fever is very contagious and can be caught by: breathing in bacteria in airborne droplets from an infected person''s coughs and sneezes touching the skin of a person with a streptococcal skin infection, such as impetigo sharing contaminated towels, baths, clothes or bed linen It can also be caught from carriers – people who have the bacteria in their throat or on their skin but don''t have any symptoms. Who''s affected by scarlet fever Most cases (about 80%) of scarlet fever occur in children under 10 (usually between two and eight years of age). However, people of any age can get the illness. As it''s so contagious, scarlet fever is likely to affect someone in close contact with a person with a sore throat or skin infection caused by streptococcus bacteria. Outbreaks often occur in nurseries and schools where children are in close contact with one another. The symptoms of scarlet fever will only develop in people susceptible to toxins produced by the streptococcus bacteria. Most children over 10 years of age will have developed immunity to these toxins. It''s possible to catch scarlet fever more than once, but this is rare. Treating scarlet fever Scarlet fever used to be a very serious illness, but nowadays most cases tend to be mild. It can easily be treated with antibiotics. Liquid antibiotics, such as penicillin or amoxicillin, are often used to treat children. These must be taken for 10 days, even though most people recover after four to five days. It''s important to be aware that your child will still be infectious for 24 hours after antibiotic treatment has begun, and therefore they shouldn''t attend nursery or school during this period (see below). Without antibiotic treatment, your child will be infectious for 1-2 weeks after symptoms appear. Read more about treating scarlet fever. Complications of scarlet fever With the right treatment, further problems are unlikely. However, there''s a small risk of the infection spreading to other parts of the body and causing more serious infections, such as an ear infection, sinusitis, or pneumonia. Read more about complications of scarlet fever. Preventing scarlet fever from spreading There’s currently no vaccine for scarlet fever. If your child has scarlet fever, keep them away from nursery or school for at least 24 hours after starting treatment with antibiotics. Adults with the illness should also stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment. GPs, schools and nurseries should be aware of the current high levels of scarlet fever and inform local health protection teams if they become aware of cases, particularly if more than one child is affected. Children and adults should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze and wash their hands with soap and water after using or disposing of tissues. Avoid sharing contaminated utensils, cups and glasses, clothes, baths, bed linen or towels. Scarlatina Scarlet fever is also sometimes known as scarlatina, although this often refers to a milder form of the illness.

Hands-only CPR To carry out a chest compression: Place the heel of your hand on the breastbone at the centre of the person’s chest. Place your other hand on top of your first hand and interlock your fingers. Position yourself with your shoulders above your hands. Using your body weight (not just your arms), press straight down by 5-6cm (2-2.5 inches) on their chest. Keeping your hands on their chest, release the compression and allow the chest to return to its original position.   Repeat these compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 times per minute until an ambulance arrives or you become exhausted. When you call for an ambulance, telephone systems now exist that can give basic life-saving instructions, including advice about CPR. These are now common and are easily accessible with mobile phones. CPR with rescue breaths If you’ve been trained in CPR, including rescue breaths, and feel confident using your skills, you should give chest compressions with rescue breaths. If you''re not completely confident, attempt hands-only CPR instead (see above). Adults Place the heel of your hand on the centre of the person''s chest, then place the other hand on top and press down by 5-6cm (2-2.5 inches) at a steady rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute. After every 30 chest compressions, give two rescue breaths. Tilt the casualty''s head gently and lift the chin up with two fingers. Pinch the person’s nose. Seal your mouth over their mouth and blow steadily and firmly into their mouth for about one second. Check that their chest rises. Give two rescue breaths. Continue with cycles of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until they begin to recover or emergency help arrives. Children over one year old Open the child''s airway by placing one hand on the child’s forehead and gently tilting their head back and lifting the chin. Remove any visible obstructions from the mouth and nose. Pinch their nose. Seal your mouth over their mouth and blow steadily and firmly into their mouth, checking that their chest rises. Give five initial rescue breaths. Place the heel of one hand on the centre of their chest and push down by 5cm (about two inches), which is approximately one-third of the chest diameter. The quality (depth) of chest compressions is very important. Use two hands if you can''t achieve a depth of 5cm using one hand. After every 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute, give two breaths. Continue with cycles of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until they begin to recover or emergency help arrives. Infants under one year old Open the infant''s airway by placing one hand on their forehead and gently tilting the head back and lifting the chin. Remove any visible obstructions from the mouth and nose. Place your mouth over the mouth and nose of the infant and blow steadily and firmly into their mouth, checking that their chest rises. Give five initial rescue breaths. Place two fingers in the middle of the chest and push down by 4cm (about 1.5 inches), which is approximately one-third of the chest diameter. The quality (depth) of chest compressions is very important. Use the heel of one hand if you can''t achieve a depth of 4cm using the tips of two fingers. After 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute, give two rescue breaths.

What is the test for Down syndrome? Media last reviewed: 17/03/2014 Next review due: 17/03/2017 Screening for Down''s, Edwards'' and Patau''s syndromes Pregnant women are offered a screening test for Down''s syndrome, Edwards'' syndrome and Patau''s syndrome from 10-14 weeks of pregnancy. This is to assess your chance of having a baby with these conditions. Down''s syndrome is also called Trisomy 21 or T21. Edwards'' syndrome is also called Trisomy 18 or T18, and Patau''s syndrome is also called Trisomy 13 or T13. The screening test offered at 10-14 weeks is called the combined test. It involves a blood test and an ultrasound scan. All women in England are offered screening for Down’s syndrome using this test. Screening for Patau’s and Edwards’ syndromes using the combined test started in 2015 and will be available across England by April 2016. If you are too far into your pregnancy to have the combined test, you will be offered other tests. For Down’s syndrome, a blood test called the quadruple test is available from weeks 14-20 of pregnancy. For Patau’s and Edwards’ syndromes, you will be offered a mid-pregnancy scan that checks for physical abnormalities. If a screening test shows that you have a higher risk of having a baby with Down''s, Edwards'' or Patau''s syndromes, you will be offered diagnostic tests to find out for certain if your baby has the condition. What are Down''s, Edwards'' and Patau''s syndromes? Inside the cells of our bodies there are tiny structures called chromosomes. Chromosomes carry the genes that determine how we develop. There are 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell. Problems can occur when sperm or egg cells are produced, which can lead to a baby having an extra chromosome.  Read more about chromosomes. Down''s syndrome In Down''s syndrome, there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 in each cell. A baby born with Down''s syndrome will have a learning disability. This means they will find it harder than most people to understand and learn new things. They may have communication problems and difficulty managing some everyday tasks. It is impossible to know what level of learning disability a baby with Down''s syndrome will have. It can vary from mild to severe. Most children with Down''s syndrome attend mainstream primary school. People with Down''s syndrome can have a good quality of life. With support from their family and others, many people are able to get jobs and live fairly independently. Some health problems are more common in people with Down''s syndrome, such as heart conditions and problems with the digestive system, hearing and vision. Sometimes these problems can be serious, but many can be treated. With good healthcare, someone with Down''s syndrome can live to around 60. People with Down''s syndrome have almond-shaped eyes and distinctive facial features, but they do not all look the same. Like all children, they also inherit features from their parents. Read more about Down''s syndrome. Edwards'' and Patau''s syndromes In Edwards'' syndrome, there is an extra copy of chromosome 18 in each cell. In Patau''s syndrome, there is an extra copy of chromosome 13 in each cell. Sadly, most babies with Edwards'' or Patau''s syndromes will die before they are born or die shortly after birth. Some babies may survive to adulthood, but this is rare. All babies born with Edwards'' or Patau''s syndromes will have a wide range of problems, which are usually very serious. These may include major brain abnormalities. Babies affected by Edwards'' syndrome can have heart problems, unusual head and facial features, growth problems, and be unable to stand or walk. Edwards'' syndrome affects about 3 out of every 10,000 births. Babies affected by Patau''s syndrome can have heart problems, a cleft lip and palate, growth problems, poorly formed eyes and ears, problems with their kidneys, and be unable to stand or walk. Patau''s syndrome affects about 2 out of every 10,000 births. Read more about Edwards'' syndrome and Patau''s syndrome. What does screening for Down''s, Edwards'' and Patau''s syndromes involve? A screening test for Down''s, Edwards'' and Patau''s syndromes is available from weeks 10-14 of pregnancy. It is called the combined test because it combines an ultrasound scan with a blood test. The scan can be carried out at the same time as the pregnancy dating scan. If you choose to have the test, a blood sample will be taken from you. At the scan, the fluid at the back of the baby''s neck is measured (known as the nuchal translucency). Your age and the information from these two tests is used to work out the risk of the baby having Down''s syndrome, or Edwards'' or Patau''s syndromes. It is not always possible to obtain a nuchal transparency measurement, and depends on the position of the baby. If this is the case, you will be offered a different blood screening test to take place from weeks 14-20.  If you are too far on in your pregnancy (more than 14 weeks) to have the combined test, you will be offered a test called the quadruple blood screening test from 14-20 weeks of pregnancy. This blood test only screens for Down’s syndrome and is not quite as accurate as the combined test. For Edwards'' and Patau''s syndromes, if you are too far into your pregnancy to have the combined test, you will be offered a mid-pregnancy scan. This scan looks for physical abnormalities and 11 rare conditions, including Edwards’ and Patau’s syndromes. Can this screening test harm me or my baby? The screening test cannot harm you or the baby, but it is important to consider carefully whether to have this test. It cannot tell you for certain if the baby has or does not have Down''s, Edward''s or Patau''s syndromes. The test can provide information that may lead to further important decisions. For example, you may be offered diagnostic tests that can tell you for certain whether the baby has these conditions, but these tests have a risk of miscarriage. Do I need to have screening for Down''s, Edwards'' or Patau''s syndromes? You do not need to have this screening test – it is your choice whether or not to have it. Some people want to find out the risk of their baby having these conditions, and some do not. You can choose to have screening for: all the conditions (Down''s, Edwards'' and Patau''s syndromes) Down''s syndrome only Edwards'' and Patau''s syndromes only none of the conditions What if I decide not to have this test? If you choose not to have the screening test for Down''s, Edwards'' or Patau''s syndromes, you can still choose to have other tests, such as a dating scan. If you choose not to have the screening test for these conditions, it is important to understand that if you have a scan at any point during your pregnancy, it could pick up physical abnormalities. The person scanning you will always tell you if any abnormalities are found. Getting your results The screening test will not tell you if your baby has or does not have Down''s, Edwards'' or Patau''s syndromes. It will tell you if you have a higher or lower risk of having a baby with one of these conditions. If you have screening for all three syndromes, you will receive one risk for Down''s syndrome and one combined risk for Edwards'' and Patau''s syndromes (two risks altogether). If your screening test shows a lower-risk result, you should be told within two weeks of the test being taken. If your screening test shows a higher-risk result, you should be told within three working days of the blood test result being available. This may take a little longer if your test is sent to another hospital. It may be worth asking the midwife what happens in your area and when you can expect to get your results. You will be offered an appointment to discuss the test results and the options you will have. The charity Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC) offers lots of information about screening results and the options you face if you get a higher-risk result. There is also an ARC forum, where you can be put in touch with people who are in the same situation as you. You can read about people''s experiences of deciding to continue a pregnancy on the ARC website. Possible results If the screening test shows that the chance of having a baby with Down''s, Edwards'' and Patau''s syndromes is lower than 1 in 150, this is a lower-risk result. More than 95 out of 100 screening test results (95%) will be lower risk. A lower-risk result does not mean there is no risk at all of the baby having Down''s, Edwards'' or Patau''s syndromes. If the screening test shows that the chance of the baby having Down''s, Edwards'' or Patau''s syndromes is higher than 1 in 150 (that is, between 1 in 2 and 1 in 150), this is called a higher-risk result. Fewer than 1 in 20 test results (5%) will be higher risk. This means that out of 100 women accepting screening for Down''s, Edwards'' and Patau''s syndromes, fewer than 5 will have a higher-risk result. A higher-risk result does not mean the baby definitely has Down''s, Edwards'' or Patau''s syndromes. Will I need further tests? If you have a lower-risk result, you will not be offered a further test. If you have a higher-risk result, you will be offered a diagnostic test, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This will tell you for certain whether the baby has Down''s, Edwards'' or Patau''s syndrome or not. About 1 in 100 diagnostic tests (1%) result in a miscarriage. It is up to you whether or not to have the further tests. When trying to decide whether to have a diagnostic test, try to balance up the risk of miscarriage with how important the result will be to you. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) This diagnostic test is usually done from weeks 11-14 of pregnancy. A fine needle, usually put through the mother''s abdomen, is used to take a tiny sample of tissue from the placenta. The cells from the tissue are then tested for Down''s, Edwards'' or Patau''s syndromes. Read more about CVS. Amniocentesis Amniocentesis is done from around week 15 of pregnancy. A fine needle is passed through the mother''s abdomen into the uterus to collect a small sample of the fluid surrounding the baby. The fluid contains cells from the baby, which are tested for Down''s, Edwards'' or Patau''s syndromes. Read more about amniocentesis. If you find out your unborn baby has Down''s, Edwards'' or Patau''s syndrome A small number of women who have a diagnostic test will find out their baby has Down''s, Edwards'' or Patau''s syndrome. They then have two options. Some women decide to continue with the pregnancy and prepare for their child with the condition; others decide they do not want to continue with the pregnancy and have a termination (abortion). If you are faced with this choice, you will get support from health professionals to help you make your decision. You can get more information from the charity Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC), which runs a helpline (Mon-Fri) on 0845 077 2290 or 020 7137 7486 from a mobile. The Down''s Syndrome Association also has useful information on screening, and the UK National Screening Committee has produced a booklet called Screening tests for you and your baby. The charity SOFT UK offers information and support through diagnosis, bereavement, pregnancy decisions and caring for all UK families affected by Edwards'' syndrome (T18) or Patau''s syndrome (T13).  Page last reviewed: 09/02/2015 Next review due: 09/02/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

It can be serious if not treated promptly. The infection develops suddenly and can spread through the body quickly. Severe infections can spread deep into the body, and can be life threatening. Most cases are successfully treated with antibiotics at home, although sometimes it needs to be treated in hospital. This page covers: Symptoms When to get medical advice Treatments Outlook Causes Prevention Symptoms of cellulitis Cellulitis causes an area of skin to suddenly become: red hot swollen painful tender It most often affects the lower legs, but can occur anywhere. In more severe cases, cellulitis can also be accompanied – and often preceded – by: a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above vigorous shaking (rigors) nausea and vomiting dizziness confusion These are signs that the infection has spread deeper into the body. Read more about the symptoms of cellulitis. When to get medical advice See your GP or visit your nearest minor injuries unit as soon as possible if an area of your skin suddenly turns red, painful and hot. Early treatment can help reduce the risk of the infection becoming severe. Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately if: your face or the area around your eye is affected your symptoms are getting rapidly worse you experience other symptoms in addition to the changes in your skin, such as a fever or vomiting you have a weak immune system – for example, because of HIV or chemotherapy – or severe lymphoedema, a condition that causes swelling in the body''s tissues a young child or elderly person has possible cellulitis Treatments for cellulitis Cellulitis is usually treated with antibiotics. Many infections can be treated with antibiotic tablets at home. You''ll usually be given a seven-day course of tablets, and your symptoms should start to improve after a few days. Make sure you complete the whole course of medicine you''ve been given, even if you''re feeling better. Contact your GP if your symptoms get worse after a few days or don''t improve within a week. For serious infections, treatment is usually started in hospital. You''ll normally be given antibiotics directly into a vein through an injection or a drip. Many hospitals can then arrange for this treatment to continue at home or in an outpatient clinic. Treatment is usually for seven days. If the infection responds to treatment quickly, it may be possible to complete the course with antibiotic tablets instead of having injections or a drip. Read more about how cellulitis is treated. Outlook for cellulitis Cellulitis can usually be treated successfully with antibiotics, and most people make a full recovery. But there is a risk it could cause potentially serious problems, particularly if it''s not treated quickly, such as: blood poisoning (septicaemia) – where the bacteria enter the blood kidney damage leg ulcers Septicaemia and kidney problems can be life threatening and require immediate treatment in hospital. Causes of cellulitis Cellulitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection. The bacteria that cause it often live harmlessly on the skin, but they can lead to an infection if they get into a break in your skin, such as: a bruise, cut or graze  an animal bite or insect bite a leg ulcer dry, cracked skin – for example, because of eczema or athlete''s foot In most cases the trigger for the infection is unknown. The infection isn''t normally spread from person to person. Read about the causes of cellulitis, including information on who''s most at risk of the condition. Preventing cellulitis If you''ve had cellulitis before, you''re more likely to get it again. It''s not always possible to prevent it, but the following measures may help reduce your risk: use moisturiser if your skin is dry or prone to cracking lose weight if you''re overweight – being obese can increase your risk of cellulitis try to ensure any conditions that can increase your risk of cellulitis – such as eczema, athlete''s foot, leg ulcers and lymphoedema – are well managed make sure any cuts, grazes or bites are kept clean – wash them under running tap water and cover them with a plaster or dressing wash your hands regularly – particularly when treating or touching a wound or skin condition If you get cellulitis often or severely, your GP may refer you to a skin specialist called a dermatologist, or an infection specialist, to discuss the option of taking antibiotics on a long-term basis to protect against further infections. Cellulitis and cellulite Cellulite is a cosmetic problem caused by fatty deposits that form underneath the skin. It is not related to cellulitis. If you''re overweight, losing weight is the best way of dealing with cellulite. Read more information and advice about losing weight.

(307, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Impetigo/Pages/Introduction.aspx', NULL, 'Impetigo - NHS Choices', 'Impetigo  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', '  Impetigo is a common and highly contagious skin infection that causes sores and blisters. It''s not usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment or within a few weeks without treatment. Impetigo is the most common skin infection in young children in the UK, but it can affect people of all ages. This topic covers: Symptoms When to seek medical advice Causes Treatment Preventing the spread of impetigo Preventing recurrent impetigo Complications Symptoms of impetigo  There are two types of impetigo: non-bullous impetigo – the most common type bullous impetigo The symptoms of both types are described below. Non-bullous impetigo The symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores – usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected. The sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin. After the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually fades without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks. The sores aren''t painful, but they may be itchy. It''s important not to touch or scratch the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of the body, and to other people. Other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and swollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases. Bullous impetigo The symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the central part of the body between the waist and neck, or on the arms and legs. The blisters are usually about 1-2cm across. The blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring. The blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. As with non-bullous impetigo, it''s important not to touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin. Symptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo. When to seek medical advice Speak to your GP if you think you or your child may have symptoms of impetigo. Impetigo isn''t usually serious, but it can sometimes have similar symptoms to more serious conditions such as cellulitis (an infection of the deeper layers of skin) so it''s important to get a correct diagnosis. Your GP can also prescribe treatment to help clear up the infection more quickly than if it was left untreated. Causes of impetigo Impetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacteria can infect the skin in two main ways: through a break in otherwise healthy skin – such as a cut, insect bite or other injury – this is known as primary impetigo through skin damaged by another underlying skin condition, such as head lice, scabies or eczema – this is known as secondary impetigo The bacteria can be spread easily through close contact with someone who has the infection, such as through direct physical contact, or by sharing towels or flannels. As the condition doesn''t cause any symptoms until four to 10 days after initial exposure to the bacteria, it''s often easily spread to others unintentionally. Children and people with diabetes or a weakened immune system – either due to a condition such as HIV or a treatment such as chemotherapy – are most at risk of developing impetigo. Treating impetigo Impetigo usually gets better without treatment in around two to three weeks. However, treatment is often recommended because it can reduce the length of the illness to around seven to 10 days and can lower the risk of the infection being spread to others. The main treatments prescribed are antibiotic creams or antibiotic tablets. These usually have to be used for around a week. Read about treating impetigo. Preventing the spread of impetigo During treatment, it''s important to take precautions to minimise the risk of impetigo spreading to other people or to other areas of the body. Most people are no longer contagious after 48 hours of treatment or once their sores have dried and healed. It''s important to stay away from work, school, nursery or playgroup until this point. The advice below can also help to prevent the spread of the infection: don''t share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo – wash them at a high temperature after use wash the sores with soap and water and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing avoid touching or scratching the sores, or letting others touch them – it may help to ensure your nails are kept clean and short avoid contact with newborn babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym – until the risk of infection has passed wash your hands frequently – particularly after touching infected skin washable toys should also be washed – wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completely If you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they''re seen by a GP as soon as possible. Preventing recurrent impetigo To reduce the risk of impetigo returning, make sure any cuts, scratches or bites are kept clean. Ensure any condition that causes broken skin, such as eczema, is treated promptly. If you develop impetigo frequently, your doctor may suggest taking a swab from around your nose to see if you carry staphylococcal bacteria. These bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, although they can lead to impetigo if they infect broken skin nearby. If you''re found to carry these bacteria, you may be prescribed an antiseptic nasal cream to apply several times a day for five to 10 days in an attempt to clear the bacteria and reduce the chances of impetigo recurring. Complications of impetigo Complications of impetigo are rare, but they can sometimes occur and can be serious. Tell your GP if you have impetigo and your symptoms change or get worse. Some complications associated with impetigo include: cellulitis – an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue scarlet fever – a rare bacterial infection that causes a fine, pink rash across the body guttate psoriasis – a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection septicaemia (a type of sepsis) – a bacterial infection of the blood Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) – a serious skin condition that looks like the skin has been scalded with boiling water post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis – an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneys In very rare cases, impetigo may lead to some scarring, particularly if you scratch at the blisters, crusts or sores.

These can include: feeling dizzy or faint a change in mental state – such as confusion or disorientation diarrhoea  nausea and vomiting slurred speech severe muscle pain severe breathlessness less urine production than normal – for example, not urinating for a day cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin loss of consciousness When to get medical help Seek medical advice urgently from NHS 111 if you''ve recently had an infection or injury and you have possible early signs of sepsis. If sepsis is suspected, you''ll usually be referred to hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. Severe sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies. If you think you or someone in your care has one of these conditions, go straight to A&E or call 999.  Tests to diagnose sepsis Sepsis is often diagnosed based on simple measurements such as your temperature, heart rate and breathing rate. You may need to give a blood test. Other tests can help determine the type of infection, where it''s located and which body functions have been affected. These include: urine or stool samples a wound culture – where a small sample of tissue, skin or fluid is taken from the affected area for testing respiratory secretion testing – taking a sample of saliva, phlegm or mucus blood pressure tests imaging studies – such as an X-ray, ultrasound scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan Treatments for sepsis If sepsis is detected early and hasn''t affected vital organs yet, it may be possible to treat the infection at home with antibiotics. Most people who have sepsis detected at this stage make a full recovery. Almost all people with severe sepsis and septic shock require admission to hospital. Some people may require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Because of problems with vital organs, people with severe sepsis are likely to be very ill and the condition can be fatal. However, sepsis is treatable if it is identified and treated quickly, and in most cases leads to a full recovery with no lasting problems. Read more about treating sepsis. Recovering from sepsis Some people make a full recovery fairly quickly. The amount of time it takes to fully recover from sepsis varies, depending on: the severity of the sepsis the person''s overall health how much time was spent in hospital whether treatment was needed in an ICU Some people experience long-term physical and/or psychological problems during their recovery period, such as: feeling lethargic or excessively tired muscle weakness swollen limbs or joint pain chest pain or breathlessness These long-term problems are known as post-sepsis syndrome. Not everyone experiences these problems. Read more about recovering from sepsis on the UK Sepsis Trust website. Who''s at risk? There are around 123,000 cases of sepsis a year in England. Around 37,000 people die every year as a result of the condition. Anyone can develop sepsis after an injury or minor infection, although some people are more vulnerable. People most at risk of sepsis include those: with a medical condition or receiving medical treatment that weakens their immune system who are already in hospital with a serious illness who are very young or very old who have just had surgery or who have wounds or injuries as a result of an accident Read more about the causes of sepsis. Sepsis, septicaemia and blood poisoning Although sepsis is often referred to as either blood poisoning or septicaemia, these terms refer to the invasion of bacteria into the bloodstream. Sepsis can affect multiple organs or the entire body, even without blood poisoning or septicaemia. Sepsis can also be caused by viral or fungal infections, although bacterial infections are by far the most common cause.

Atopic eczema is more common in children, often developing before their first birthday. However, it may also develop for the first time in adults. It''s usually a long-term (chronic) condition, although it can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older. This topic covers: Symptoms When to seek medical advice Causes Treatment Other types of eczema Symptoms of atopic eczema Atopic eczema causes the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked, sore and red. Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body.             Although atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, it most often affects the hands, insides of the elbows, backs of the knees and the face and scalp in children. People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups). Read about the symptoms of atopic eczema  When to seek medical advice See your GP if you have symptoms of atopic eczema. They''ll usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions such as: whether the rash is itchy and where it appears when the symptoms first began whether it comes and goes over time whether there''s a history of atopic eczema in your family whether you have any other conditions, such as allergies or asthma whether something in your diet or lifestyle may be contributing to your symptoms Typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and three or more of the following: visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin – such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above generally dry skin in the last 12 months a history of asthma or hay fever – children under four must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has one of these conditions the condition started before the age of two (this does not apply to children under the age of four) Causes of atopic eczema The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it''s clear it is not down to one single thing. Atopic eczema often occurs in people who get allergies – "atopic" means sensitivity to allergens. It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever. The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather. Sometimes food allergies can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema. You may be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse. Allergy tests aren''t usually needed, although they''re sometimes helpful in identifying whether a food allergy may be triggering symptoms. Read about the causes of atopic eczema. Treating atopic eczema  Treatment for atopic eczema can help to relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time. However, there''s currently no cure and severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life, which may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally. There''s also an increased risk of skin infections.  Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including: self care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers emollients (moisturising treatments) – used on a daily basis for dry skin  topical corticosteroids – used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups Read about treating atopic eczema and complications of atopic eczema. Other types of eczema Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin.

But occasionally they can become infected, cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or spread serious illnesses such as Lyme disease and malaria. Bugs that bite or sting include wasps, hornets, bees, horseflies, ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, spiders and midges. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you''ve been bitten or stung When to get medical advice When to get emergency medical help Prevention Symptoms of insect bites and stings Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Some people have a mild allergic reaction and a larger area of skin around the bite or sting becomes swollen, red and painful. This should pass within a week. Occasionally, a severe allergic reaction can occur, causing symptoms such as breathing difficulties, dizziness and a swollen face or mouth. This requires immediate medical treatment (see below). Read more about the symptoms of common insect bites and stings. What to do if you''ve been bitten or stung To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting or tick if it''s still in the skin (see treating insect bites and stings for advice about how to do this safely). Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they''re unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as painkillers, creams for itching and antihistamines. Read more about treatments for insect bites and stings. When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if: you''re worried about a bite or sting your symptoms don''t start to improve within a few days or are getting worse you''ve been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes a large area (around 10cm or more) around the bite becomes red and swollen you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a fever, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms When to get emergency medical help Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as: wheezing or difficulty breathing a swollen face, mouth or throat nausea or vomiting a fast heart rate dizziness or feeling faint difficulty swallowing loss of consciousness Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees – don''t wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin – repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants – these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you''re travelling to part of the world where there''s a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

(311, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/vasectomy-male-sterilisation.aspx', 'Vasectomy', 'Vasectomy (male sterilisation) - Contraception guide - NHS Choices', '', 'A woman can get pregnant if a man’s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is vasectomy (male sterilisation). At a glance: vasectomy   How vasectomy works   Who can have a vasectomy   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks   Common questions During a minor operation, the tubes that carry sperm from a man''s testicles to the penis are cut, blocked or sealed. This prevents sperm from reaching the seminal fluid (semen), which is ejaculated from the penis during sex. There will be no sperm in the semen, so a woman''s egg can''t be fertilised.   Vasectomy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic, and takes about 15 minutes. At a glance: facts about vasectomy In most cases, vasectomy is more than 99% effective. Out of 2,000 men who are sterilised, one will get a woman pregnant during the rest of his lifetime. Male sterilisation is considered permanent – once it''s done, you don''t have to think about contraception again. You need to use contraception for at least eight weeks after the operation, because sperm stay in the tubes leading to the penis. Up to two semen tests are done after the operation, to ensure that all the sperm have gone.  Your scrotum (ball sack) may become bruised, swollen or painful – some men have ongoing pain in their testicles. As with any surgery, there''s a slight risk of infection.  Reversing the operation isn''t easy, and is rarely available on the NHS. Vasectomy doesn''t protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using a condom, you’ll protect yourself and your partner against STIs.  How vasectomy works Vasectomy works by stopping sperm from getting into a man’s semen. This means that when a man ejaculates, the semen has no sperm and a woman’s egg cannot be fertilised. How vasectomy is carried out  Conventional vasectomy No-scalpel vasectomy Before you decide to have a vasectomy How long will I have to wait for the operation? Recovering after the operation How will I know if the vasectomy has worked? Is reversal possible? How vasectomy is carried out Vasectomy is a quick and relatively painless surgical procedure. The tubes that carry sperm from a man''s testicles to the penis are cut, blocked or sealed with heat. In most cases, you will be able to return home the same day. Most vasectomies are carried out under local anaesthetic. This means that only your scrotum and testicles will be numbed, and you will be awake for the procedure. You will not feel any pain, although it may feel slightly uncomfortable. In rare cases, a general anaesthetic may be required. This means that you will be asleep during the procedure. A general anaesthetic may be used if you are allergic to local anaesthetic or have a history of fainting easily. However, most people will only need a local anaesthetic. A vasectomy has no effect on sex drive or ability to enjoy sex. You will still have erections and ejaculate normally. The only difference is that your semen will not contain sperm.  A vasectomy can be performed at: your local GP surgery a hospital as a day-patient appointment a sexual health clinic a private clinic   There are two types of vasectomy. The traditional technique, called conventional vasectomy, involves making two small incisions in the scrotum (the pouch of skin that surrounds your testicles) using a scalpel (surgical knife). The other type, called a no-scalpel vasectomy, is a newer technique now in common use. The doctor doing your vasectomy will discuss with you which is best. Conventional vasectomy During a conventional vasectomy, the skin of your scrotum is numbed with local anaesthetic. The doctor makes two small cuts, about 1cm long, on each side of your scrotum. The incisions allow your surgeon to access the tubes that carry sperm out of your testicles. These tubes are known as "vas deferens". Each tube is cut and a small section removed. The ends of the tubes are then closed, either by tying them or sealing them using diathermy (an instrument that heats to a very high temperature). The incisions are stitched, usually using dissolvable stitches, which will disappear naturally within about a week. No-scalpel vasectomy You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people''s services Find a clinic near you No-scalpel vasectomy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic. During a no-scalpel vasectomy, the doctor will feel the vas deferens underneath the skin of your scrotum and then hold them in place using a small clamp. A special instrument is then used to make a tiny puncture hole in the skin of the scrotum. A small pair of forceps is used to open up the hole, allowing the surgeon to access the vas deferens without needing to cut the skin with a scalpel. The tubes are then closed in the same way as in a conventional vasectomy, either by being tied or sealed. During a no-scalpel vasectomy, there will be little bleeding and no stitches. The procedure is also thought to be less painful and less likely to cause complications than a conventional vasectomy. Before you decide to have a vasectomy Your doctor will ask about your circumstances and provide information and counselling before agreeing to the procedure. You should only have a vasectomy if you are certain that you do not want to have any, or any more, children. If you have any doubts, consider another method of contraception until you are completely sure. You shouldn''t make the decision about having a vasectomy after a crisis or a big change in your life – for example, if your partner has just had a baby, or has just terminated a pregnancy. If you have a partner, discuss it with them before deciding to have a vasectomy. If possible, you should both agree to the procedure, but it is not a legal requirement to get your partner''s permission. You can have a vasectomy at any age. However, if you are under 30, particularly if you do not have children, your doctor may be reluctant to perform the procedure. Your GP does have the right to refuse to carry out the procedure or refuse to refer you for the procedure if they do not believe that it is in your best interests. If this is the case, you may have to pay to have a vasectomy privately. How long will I have to wait for the operation? In most parts of the UK, a vasectomy is available free of charge from the NHS. However, waiting lists can be several months, depending on where you live. Speak to your GP or ask at your local contraception clinic about vasectomies in your area. As waiting lists for vasectomies can be long, some men choose to pay to have the procedure carried out privately. You can request a male doctor, but in some cases this may mean having to wait longer. Your GP may be able to offer you options of where the vasectomy can be carried out. Recovering after the operation It’s common to have some mild discomfort, swelling and bruising of your scrotum for a few days after the vasectomy. If you have pain or discomfort, you can take painkillers, such as paracetamol. Contact your GP for advice if you are still experiencing considerable pain after taking painkillers. It’s common to have blood in your semen in the first few ejaculations after a vasectomy. This isn’t harmful. Some other common questions about recovery are outlined below. Underwear Wearing close-fitting underwear, such as Y-fronts, during the day and at night will help to support your scrotum and will also help ease any discomfort or swelling. Make sure you change your underwear every day. Hygiene It is usually safe for you to have a bath or shower after your operation – check with your doctor what is suitable for you. Make sure you dry your genital area gently and thoroughly. Returning to work Most men will be fit to return to work one or two days after their vasectomy, but you should avoid sport and heavy lifting for at least one week after the operation. This is to minimise the risk of developing complications (see below). If any symptoms continue after a few days, consult your GP. Having sex You can have sex again as soon as it is comfortable to do so, although it is best to wait for a couple of days. However, you will still have sperm in your semen immediately after the operation, as it takes time to clear the remaining sperm in your tubes. It takes an average of 20-30 ejaculations to clear the tubes of sperm. You will need to use another method of contraception until you have had two clear semen tests. Once the operation has been carried out successfully and semen tests have shown that there is no sperm present, long-term partners may not need to use other forms of contraception. However, a vasectomy does not protect against HIV infection or any other STIs, so you should still use condoms with any new partner. How will I know if my vasectomy has worked? After the vasectomy, there will be some sperm left in the upper part of the vas deferens tubes. It can take more than 20 ejaculations to clear these sperm from the tubes so, during this time, there is still a risk of pregnancy. Until it has been confirmed that your semen is free of sperm, you should continue to use another form of contraception. At least eight weeks after the procedure, you will need to produce a sample of semen, which will be tested for sperm. This will also help to identify the rare cases in which the tubes naturally rejoin themselves. Once tests have confirmed that your semen is free of sperm, the vasectomy is considered successful and you can stop using additional contraception. A few men continue to have small numbers of sperm in their system, but these sperm do not move (they are known as non-motile sperm). If you are one of these men, your doctor will discuss your options with you. The chances of making your partner pregnant may be low enough to consider the vasectomy successful, or you may be advised to have further tests or consider other options. Is reversal possible? It is possible to have a vasectomy reversed. However, the procedure is not always successful. You have a better chance if it is done soon after the vasectomy. If a reversal is carried out within 10 years of your vasectomy, the success rate is about 55%. This falls to 25% if your reversal is carried out more than 10 years after your vasectomy. Even if a surgeon manages to join up the vas deferens tubes again, pregnancy may still not be possible. This is why you should be certain before going ahead with the vasectomy. Your doctor can help you to make your decision. Reversal is rarely available on the NHS and the operation can be expensive if done privately. Who can have a vasectomy Having a vasectomy should always be viewed as permanent sterilisation. This is because, although reversal is sometimes possible, it may not be successful. A reversal operation requires delicate microsurgery to join the tubes together again. Even with a successful operation, it still may not be possible to father a child. Advantages and disadvantages of vasectomy Advantages The failure rate is only one in 2,000 – out of 2,000 men who have a vasectomy, only one will get a woman pregnant in the rest of his lifetime. There are rarely long-term effects on your health. Vasectomy does not affect your hormone levels or sex drive. It will not affect the spontaneity of sex or interfere with sex. Vasectomy may be chosen as a simpler, safer and more reliable alternative to female sterilisation. Disadvantages Vasectomy doesn’t protect against STIs It’s difficult to reverse, and reversal may not be available on the NHS. You need to use contraception after the operation until tests show your semen is free of sperm – if your semen contains sperm, you could make your partner pregnant. Complications can occur – the risks are listed below. Risks Most men feel sore and tender for a few days after the operation, and will usually experience some bruising and swelling on or around their scrotum. However, in some cases, a vasectomy can cause more serious problems, some of which are outlined below. Haematoma A haematoma is when blood collects and clots in the tissue surrounding a broken blood vessel. Following a vasectomy, you may develop a haematoma inside your scrotum. Haematomas are mostly small (pea-sized), but can occasionally be large (filling the scrotum) and, rarely, they can be very large. This can cause your scrotum to become very swollen and painful. In severe cases, you may need further surgery to treat the blood clot. Sperm granulomas When the tubes that carry sperm from your testicles are cut, sperm can sometimes leak from them. In rare cases, sperm can collect in the surrounding tissue, forming hard lumps that are known as sperm granulomas. Your groin or scrotum may become painful and swollen either immediately or a few months after the procedure. The lumps are not usually painful and can often be treated using anti-inflammatory medication, which your GP will prescribe. If the granulomas are particularly large or painful, they may have to be surgically removed. Infection After a vasectomy, you may be at risk of developing an infection as a result of bacteria entering through the cuts made in your scrotum. Therefore, after the operation, it is important to keep your genital area clean and dry to keep the risk of infection as low as you can. Long-term testicle pain Some men get pain in one or both of their testicles after a vasectomy. It can happen immediately, a few months or a few years after the operation. It may be occasional or quite frequent, and vary from a constant dull ache to episodes of sharp, intense pain. For most men, however, any pain is quite mild and they do not need further help for it. Long-term testicular pain affects around one in 10 men after vasectomy. The pain is usually the result of a pinched nerve or scarring that occurred during the operation. You may be advised to undergo further surgery to repair the damage and to help minimise further pain. Testicles feeling full After a vasectomy, some men may develop the sensation that their testicles are "fuller" than normal. This is usually caused by the epididymis becoming filled with stored sperm. The epididymis is the long, coiled tube that rests on the back of each testicle. It helps to transport and store sperm. Any such feelings should pass naturally within a few weeks. However, speak to your GP if you are still experiencing fullness after this time. Fertility In a very small number of vasectomy cases, the vas deferens reconnects over a period of time. This means that the vasectomy will no longer be an effective form of contraception. However, it is rare for this to happen. Common questions about vasectomy Can I have the operation if I am single? Yes, but if you are under 30 you will find that many surgeons are reluctant to do it, in case your circumstances change and you regret it later. Will it affect my sex drive? No. After a successful vasectomy, your testicles will continue to produce the male hormone (testosterone) just as they did before the procedure. Your sex drive, sensation and ability to have an erection won’t be affected. The only difference is that there will be no sperm in your semen. Your body still produces sperm, but they are absorbed without harm. Could being sterile affect me emotionally? It is a big decision to end the part of your life where you could father a child. This is another reason to think it over carefully. If you are sure about your decision to have a vasectomy, you may feel relieved that the worry of possible pregnancy is over and you do not need to think about contraception again. If you feel anxious or uncomfortable about the procedure, or if you think you would suffer mentally from being infertile, then it is not the best type of contraception for you. You can discuss alternatives with your GP or with a professional at a contraception clinic (sometimes called a family planning clinic). Is there any risk of vasectomy causing cancer? Although prostate cancer and testicular cancer can occur in men who have had a vasectomy, research suggests that vasectomy does not increase your risk of cancer. Can I use IVF to father a child? If you have a vasectomy, and then decide later that you want a child, there may be the option of doing so by IVF (in vitro fertilisation). To do this, a surgeon would retrieve sperm from your testicles and use this to fertilise your partner’s egg. However: IVF may not be available on the NHS IVF done privately can be expensive  IVF is not always successful Can I store sperm in a sperm bank, just in case? You could but, as with IVF, sperm stored in a sperm bank cannot be relied on to bring about a pregnancy. It can also be expensive. Where to get contraception Most types of contraception are available for free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. You can get contraception, and information and advice about contraception, at: most GP surgeries – talk to your GP or practice nurse  community contraception clinics  some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics  sexual health clinics – they also offer contraception and STI testing services  some young people’s services (call 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you''re under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won''t tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you''re given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They''ll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won''t make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you''re at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.  Page last reviewed: 13/01/2015 Next review due: 13/01/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Treatment is often recommended as it can help clear up the infection in around seven to 10 days and reduce the risk of the infection being passed on to others. If impetigo is confirmed, it can usually be effectively treated with antibiotics. If the infection is being caused by an underlying skin condition, such as eczema, this may also need to be treated. Antibiotic cream For mild cases of impetigo that cover a small area, antibiotic cream is often recommended. This usually needs to be applied three or four times a day for seven days. Before applying the cream, wash any affected areas of skin with warm, soapy water and try to clean off any crusts that have developed. To reduce the risk of spreading the infection, it''s also important that you wash your hands immediately after applying the cream or, if available, wear latex gloves while applying the cream. Side effects of antibiotic cream can include: irritation redness itchiness in the area where the cream is applied If symptoms haven''t improved after seven days of starting treatment, speak to your GP about other possible treatment options. Antibiotic tablets Antibiotic tablets may be prescribed if the infection is more severe and widespread, or if the symptoms don''t improve after using antibiotic cream. These usually need to be taken two to four times a day for seven days. If a course of oral antibiotics is prescribed for you or your child, it''s very important that the course is finished even if the symptoms clear up before you''ve taken all the tablets.  Common side effects of oral antibiotics include: feeling sick vomiting diarrhoea Speak to your GP if your symptoms haven''t improved after seven days of treatment with antibiotic tablets. Further testing and treatment Further tests are usually only required in cases where the infection is severe or widespread, doesn''t respond to treatment, or keeps recurring. In these circumstances, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) for further tests or they may take a swab of the affected skin themselves for testing. This can help to rule out or confirm other skin conditions that may be responsible for your symptoms and can detect whether you carry one of the types of bacteria responsible for the infection inside your nose. If your doctor thinks you may keep getting impetigo because you naturally have these bacteria inside your nose, they may prescribe you an antiseptic nasal cream to try to clear the bacteria.

"I think the kids got their flannels mixed up, because, by then, my ten-year-old daughter Sinead had caught it too. Then they passed it to their baby brother. "I had them all treated with antibiotics that Monday, and by Friday the spots had gone completely. "Luckily it was the holidays, so I didn''t need to keep them off school. For the first few days of treatment, when the spots were still weeping, I kept them inside and they played together in the house.

It''s one of a group of painkillers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and can be used to: ease mild to moderate pain – such as toothache, migraine and period pain control a high temperature (fever) – for example, when someone has the flu (influenza) ease pain and inflammation (redness and swelling) caused by conditions that affect the joints, bones and muscles – such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis ease pain and swelling caused by sprains and strains – such as sports injuries This topic covers: Types of ibuprofen Who can take ibuprofen How to take ibuprofen Interactions with medicines, food and alcohol Side effects of ibuprofen Overdoses of ibuprofen Types of ibuprofen You can buy most types of ibuprofen from supermarkets, general retail outlets or pharmacies. Some types and pack sizes are only available from pharmacy counters, and some only on prescription. Ibuprofen is available in many forms, including: tablets capsules liquids gels or creams sprays In some products ibuprofen is combined with other ingredients. For example, it''s sometimes combined with medicine for a blocked nose (a decongestant) and sold as a cold and flu remedy. Who can take ibuprofen Some people should avoid using ibuprofen and others should use it with caution. If you have any queries about using ibuprofen or any other medicines, speak to your GP or pharmacist, or call NHS 111. You shouldn''t take ibuprofen if you: have a history of a strong, unpleasant reaction (hypersensitivity) to aspirin or other NSAIDs currently have or recently had a stomach ulcer, or you have had one in the past have severe heart failure have severe liver disease are taking low-dose aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular disease You should use ibuprofen with caution if you''re aged 65 or over, breastfeeding, or have: asthma kidney or liver problems lupus Crohn''s disease or ulcerative colitis previously had any bleeding in your stomach high blood pressure (hypertension) narrowing of the arteries (peripheral arterial disease) any problems with your heart, such as angina, heart attacks, or mild or moderate heart failure had a stroke Ibuprofen and pregnancy Ideally, pregnant women shouldn''t take ibuprofen unless a doctor recommends and prescribes it. It''s best to tell your GP, pharmacist or health visitor about any medicines you''re taking. Paracetamol is recommended as an alternative to ease short-term pain or reduce a high temperature. Ibuprofen and breastfeeding Ibuprofen appears in breast milk in small amounts, so it''s unlikely to cause any harm to your baby while you''re breastfeeding. Ibuprofen and children Ibuprofen may be given to children aged three months or over who weigh at least 5kg (11lbs) to relieve pain, inflammation or fever. Your GP or another healthcare professional may recommend ibuprofen for younger children in certain cases – for example, this may be to control a fever after a vaccination if paracetamol is unsuitable. If your baby or child has a high temperature that doesn''t get better or they continue to experience pain, speak to your GP or call NHS 111. How to take ibuprofen Make sure you use ibuprofen as directed on the label or leaflet, or as instructed by a health professional. How much you can take depends on your age, the type of ibuprofen you''re taking and how strong it is. For example: adults – can usually take one or two 200mg tablets every four to six hours, but shouldn''t take more than 1,200mg (six 200mg) tablets in the space of 24 hours children under 16 – may need to take a lower dose depending on their age; check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice The painkilling effect of ibuprofen begins soon after a dose is taken, but the anti-inflammatory effect can sometimes take up to three weeks to get the best results. Ibuprofen shouldn''t be used to treat conditions that are mainly related to inflammation. Don''t take more than the recommended dose if it isn''t relieving your symptoms. Adults can take paracetamol at the same time as ibuprofen if necessary, but this isn''t recommended for children. For more details, see Can I take paracetamol and ibuprofen together?. Contact your GP or call NHS 111 if your symptoms get worse or last more than three days despite taking ibuprofen. Interactions with medicines, food and alcohol Ibuprofen can react unpredictably with certain other medicines. This can affect how well either medicine works and increase the risk of side effects. Check the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with ibuprofen. Ask your GP or local pharmacist if you''re not sure.  As ibuprofen is a type of NSAID, you shouldn''t take more than one of these at a time or you''ll have an increased risk of side effects.  NSAIDs can also interact with many other medicines, including: some types of antidepressants – used to treat depression beta-blockers – used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) diuretics – which reduce the amount of fluid in your body Read more about medicines that interact with NSAIDs. Ibuprofen can also interact with ginkgo biloba, a controversial dietary supplement some people claim can treat memory problems and dementia. There are no known problems caused by taking ibuprofen with any specific foods or by drinking a moderate amount of alcohol. Side effects of ibuprofen Ibuprofen can cause a number of side effects. You should take the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time needed to control your symptoms. See the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for a full list of side effects. Common side effects of ibuprofen include: nausea or vomiting constipation or diarrhoea indigestion (dyspepsia) or abdominal pain Less common side effects include: headache or dizziness bloating (fluid retention) raised blood pressure inflammation of the stomach (gastritis) a stomach ulcer allergic reactions – such as a rash worsening of asthma symptoms by causing narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) kidney failure black stools and blood in your vomit – this can indicate bleeding in your stomach If you feel unwell after taking ibuprofen or have concerns, speak to your GP or pharmacist, or call NHS 111. You can also report suspected side effects using the Yellow Card Scheme. High doses Taking high doses of ibuprofen over long periods of time can increase your risk of: stroke – when the blood supply to the brain is disturbed heart attacks – when the blood supply to the heart is blocked In women, long-term use of ibuprofen might be associated with reduced fertility. This is usually reversible when you stop taking ibuprofen. Overdoses of ibuprofen Taking too much ibuprofen, known as an overdose, can be very dangerous. If you''ve taken more than the recommended maximum dose, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible. It can be helpful to take any remaining medicine and the box or leaflet with you to A&E if you can. Some people feel sick, vomit, have abdominal pain or ringing in their ears (tinnitus) after taking too much ibuprofen, but often there are no symptoms at first. Go to A&E even if you''re feeling well. Page last reviewed: 17/05/2016 Next review due: 01/05/2019', 1681667131),
(316, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Mumps/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Mumps', 'Mumps - NHS Choices', 'Mumps  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Mumps is a contagious viral infection that used to be common in children before the introduction of the MMR vaccine. It’s most recognisable by the painful swellings at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), giving a person with mumps a distinctive "hamster face" appearance. Other symptoms of mumps include headaches, joint pain and a high temperature, which may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands. When to see your GP It''s important to contact your GP if you suspect mumps so a diagnosis can be made. While mumps isn''t usually serious, the condition has similar symptoms to more serious types of infection, such as glandular fever and tonsillitis. Your GP can usually make a diagnosis after seeing and feeling the swelling, looking at the position of the tonsils in the mouth and checking the person''s temperature to see if it''s higher than normal. Let your GP know in advance if you''re coming to the surgery, so they can take any necessary precautions to prevent the spread of infection. If your GP suspects mumps, they should notify your local health protection unit (HPU). The HPU will arrange for a sample of saliva to be tested to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. How mumps is spread Mumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu – through infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and transferred into the mouth or nose.   A person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards. During this time, it''s important to prevent the infection spreading to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who haven''t been vaccinated. If you have mumps, you can help prevent it spreading by: regularly washing your hands with soap using and disposing of tissues when you sneeze avoiding school or work for at least five days after your symptoms first develop Preventing mumps You can protect your child against mumps by making sure they''re given the combined MMR vaccine (for mumps, measles and rubella). The MMR vaccine is part of the routine NHS childhood immunisation schedule. Your child should be given one dose when they are around 12-13 months and a second booster dose before they start school. Once both doses are given, the vaccine provides 95% protection against mumps. Treatment for mumps There''s currently no cure for mumps, but the infection should pass within one or two weeks. Treatment is used to relieve symptoms and includes: getting plenty of bed rest and fluids using painkillers, such as ibuprofen and paracetamol – aspirin shouldn''t be given to children under 16 applying a warm or cool compress to the swollen glands to help relieve pain Read more about treating mumps. Complications Mumps usually passes without causing serious damage to a person''s health. Serious complications are rare. However, mumps can lead to viral meningitis if the virus moves into the outer layer of the brain. Other complications include swelling of the testicles in males or the ovaries in females (if the affected male or female has gone through puberty). Read more about the complications of mumps. Who is affected Most cases of mumps occur in young adults (usually born between 1980 and 1990) who didn’t receive the MMR vaccine as part of their childhood vaccination schedule or didn''t have mumps as a child. There were 2,224 confirmed cases of mumps in England and Wales during 2014. Once you''ve been infected by the mumps virus, you normally develop a life-long immunity to further infection. Page last reviewed: 07/08/2015 Next review due: 01/08/2018', 1875416256),

Stay away from work or school for at least four days from when the measles rash first appears to reduce the risk of spreading the infection. You should also try to avoid contact with people who are more vulnerable to the infection, such as young children and pregnant women. Relieving symptoms If the symptoms of measles are causing discomfort for you or your child, there are some things you can do to treat these while you wait for your body to fight off the virus. Controlling fever and relieving pain Paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to reduce a high temperature (fever) and relieve any aches or pains if your child is uncomfortable. Liquid infant paracetamol can be used for young children. Aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old. Speak to your pharmacist if you''re not sure which medications are suitable for your child. Drink plenty of fluids If your child has a high temperature, make sure they drink plenty of fluids as they may be at risk of dehydration. Keeping hydrated may also help reduce throat discomfort caused by coughing. Treating sore eyes You can gently clean away any crustiness from your child''s eyelids and lashes using cotton wool soaked in water. Closing curtains or dimming lights can help if bright light is hurting their eyes. Treating cold-like symptoms If your child has cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose or a cough, there are a number of things you can do to help them feel more comfortable. For example, it might help your child if they sit in a hot, steamy bathroom. Or you could put a wet towel on a warm radiator to moisten the air, which may help ease your child''s cough. Drinking warm drinks, particularly ones containing lemon or honey, may also help to relax the airways, loosen mucus, and soothe a cough. Honey should not be given to babies under 12 months. Spotting signs of serious illness If you or your child has measles, you should keep an eye out for any signs of the serious complications that can sometimes develop. Signs of a more serious problem include: shortness of breath a sharp chest pain that feels worse with breathing coughing up blood drowsiness confusion fits (convulsions) Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department or call 999 for an ambulance if you or your child develop any of these symptoms.

In children with ASD, the symptoms are present before three years of age, although a diagnosis can sometimes be made after the age of three. It''s estimated that about 1 in every 100 people in the UK has ASD. More boys are diagnosed with the condition than girls. There''s no "cure" for ASD, but speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, educational support, plus a number of other interventions are available to help children and parents. Read about help and support available for people with ASD. Signs and symptoms People with ASD tend to have problems with social interaction and communication. In early infancy, some children with ASD don’t babble or use other vocal sounds. Older children have problems using non-verbal behaviours to interact with others – for example, they have difficulty with eye contact, facial expressions, body language and gestures. They may give no or brief eye contact and ignore familiar or unfamiliar people. Children with ASD may also lack awareness of and interest in other children. They’ll often either gravitate to older or younger children, rather than interacting with children of the same age. They tend to play alone. They can find it hard to understand other people''s emotions and feelings, and have difficulty starting conversations or taking part in them properly. Language development may be delayed, and a child with ASD won’t compensate their lack of language or delayed language skills by using gestures (body language) or facial expressions. Children with ASD will tend to repeat words or phrases spoken by others (either immediately or later) without formulating their own language, or in parallel to developing their language skills. Some children don’t demonstrate imaginative or pretend play, while others will continually repeat the same pretend play. Some children with ASD like to stick to the same routine and little changes may trigger tantrums. Some children may flap their hand or twist or flick their fingers when they’re excited or upset. Others may engage in repetitive activity, such as turning light switches on and off, opening and closing doors, or lining things up. Children and young people with ASD frequently experience a range of cognitive (thinking), learning, emotional and behavioural problems. For example, they may also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, or depression. About 70% of children with ASD have a non-verbal IQ below 70. Of these, 50% have a non-verbal IQ below 50. Overall, up to 50% of people with "severe learning difficulties" have an ASD. Read more about the symptoms of ASD. Getting a diagnosis The main features of ASD – problems with social communication and interaction – can often be recognised during early childhood. Some features of ASD may not become noticeable until a change of situation, such as when the child starts nursery or school. See your GP or health visitor if you notice any of the signs and symptoms of ASD in your child, or if you''re concerned about your child''s development. It can also be helpful to discuss your concerns with your child''s nursery or school. Read more about diagnosing ASD. Caring for someone with ASD Being a carer isn''t an easy role. When you''re busy responding to the needs of others, it can affect your emotional and physical energy, and make it easy to forget your own health and mental wellbeing. If you''re caring for someone else, it''s important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It''s in your best interests and those of the person you care for. Read more about care and support, including information on: carers'' assessments support and the benefits carers are entitled to carers'' breaks and respite care You can also call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053. What causes ASD? The exact cause of ASD is unknown, but it''s thought that several complex genetic and environmental factors are involved. In the past, some people believed the MMR vaccine caused ASD, but this has been investigated extensively in a number of major studies around the world, involving millions of children, and researchers have found no evidence of a link between MMR and ASD. Read more about the causes of ASD. Autism in adults Some people with ASD had features of the condition as a child, but enter adulthood without ever being diagnosed. However, getting a diagnosis as an adult can often help a person with ASD and their families understand the condition, and work out what type of advice and support they need. For example, a number of autism-specific services are available that provide adults with ASD with the help and support they need to live independently and find a job that matches their skills and abilities.

It''s different to acute pancreatitis, where the inflammation is only short-term. The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of abdominal (tummy) pain, which can be severe. Other symptoms tend to develop as the damage to the pancreas progresses, such as producing greasy, foul-smelling stools. Read more about the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis and diagnosing chronic pancreatitis. When to seek medical advice Always visit your GP if you''re experiencing severe pain – it''s a warning sign that something is wrong. Why it happens Long-term alcohol misuse is responsible for around 7 out of every 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis. This is because heavy drinking over a number of years can repeatedly damage the pancreas. Less common causes include: smoking a problem with the immune system, causing it to attack the pancreas an inherited genetic mutation disrupting the functions of the pancreas In as many as 3 out of 10 people with the condition, the cause cannot be identified – this is known as "idiopathic" chronic pancreatitis. Read more about the causes of chronic pancreatitis. Who''s affected Chronic pancreatitis can affect people of any age, but is most common in middle-aged men aged between 45 and 54. Between 2012 and 2013, over 35,000 people visited hospitals in England with the condition. How it''s treated In most cases of chronic pancreatitis, there''s no specific treatment to reduce the inflammation and repair the damage to the pancreas. Treatment mainly focuses on lifestyle changes (see below) and medication to relieve the pain. Surgery is sometimes needed to treat severe chronic pain that doesn''t respond to painkillers. However, the pain can be difficult to treat and can seriously affect your quality of life. People who don''t smoke cigarettes and avoid drinking alcohol tend to experience less pain and live longer than those who continue to drink and smoke after receiving a diagnosis. Read more about treating chronic pancreatitis. Complications Living with chronic pain can cause mental as well as physical strain. It''s important to speak to your GP if you''re experiencing stress, anxiety or depression caused by chronic pancreatitis. Diabetes is a common complication of chronic pancreatitis and affects about a third of people with the condition. It occurs when the pancreas is damaged and unable to produce insulin. People with chronic pancreatitis also have an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Read more about the possible complications of chronic pancreatitis.

(322, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Painkillers-paracetamol/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'paracetamol', 'Paracetamol - NHS Choices', 'Paracetamol  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', '  Paracetamol is a commonly used medicine that can help treat pain and reduce a high temperature (fever). It''s typically used to relieve mild or moderate pain, such as headaches, toothache or sprains, and reduce fevers caused by illnesses such as colds and flu. Paracetamol is often recommended as one of the first treatments for pain, as it''s safe for most people to take and side effects are rare. This page covers: Types of paracetamol Who can take it How to take it Taking it with other medicines, food and alcohol Side effects Overdoses and extra doses Types of paracetamol You can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription. Paracetamol is available as: tablets or caplets capsules liquid – usually for children soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink) suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage) an injection given into a vein – normally only used in hospital In some products, such as cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. It may be sold under the name paracetamol, or under various brand names (which may also contain other ingredients). Who can take paracetamol Most people can take paracetamol safely, including: pregnant women breastfeeding women children over two months of age – lower doses are recommended for young children (see How to take paracetamol below) If you''re not sure whether you can take paracetamol, check the leaflet that comes with it or ask your pharmacist or doctor for advice. Always get advice before taking paracetamol if you: have liver or kidney problems have problems with alcohol, such as long-term alcohol misuse are very underweight are taking other medications (see Interactions with other medicines below) Don''t take paracetamol if you''ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past. How to take paracetamol Make sure you take paracetamol as directed on the label or leaflet, or as instructed by a health professional. How much you can take depends on your age, your weight, the type of paracetamol you''re taking and how strong it is. For example: Adults can usually take one or two 500mg tablets every 4-6 hours, but shouldn''t take more than 4g (eight 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Children under 16 need to take a lower dose, depending on their age or weight – check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice. For very young children, paracetamol liquid is given using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe. Paracetamol should start to work within an hour and the effect usually lasts several hours. Don''t take more than the recommended dose if it isn''t relieving your symptoms. Adults can take ibuprofen at the same time if necessary, but this isn''t usually recommended for children. For more details, see Can I take paracetamol and ibuprofen together? Contact your GP or call NHS 111 if your symptoms get worse or last more than three days despite taking paracetamol. Be careful not to use other medications that contain paracetamol as an ingredient (such as some cold and flu remedies) while you''re taking paracetamol. Taking paracetamol with other medicines, food and alcohol Paracetamol can react unpredictably with certain other medications. This can affect how well either medicine works and might increase the risk of side effects. It may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as: other products containing paracetamol – including combination products where paracetamol is one of the ingredients carbamazepine – used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain colestyramine – used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease) imatinib and busulfan – used to treat certain types of cancer ketoconazole – a type of antifungal medicine lixisenatide – used to treat type 2 diabetes metoclopramide – used to relieve nausea and vomiting phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone – used to control seizures warfarin – used to prevent blood clots Check the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you''re not sure. There are no known problems caused by taking paracetamol with any specific foods or by drinking moderate amounts of alcohol while taking paracetamol. Side effects of paracetamol Side effects from paracetamol are rare but can include: an allergic reaction, which can cause a rash and swelling flushing, low blood pressure and a fast heartbeat – this can sometimes happen when paracetamol is given in hospital into a vein in your arm blood disorders, such as thrombocytopenia (low number of platelet cells) and leukopenia (low number of white blood cells) liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) – this can be fatal in severe cases Speak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any troublesome side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol. You can also report suspected side effects using the Yellow Card Scheme. Overdoses of paracetamol Taking too much paracetamol, known as an overdose, can be very dangerous. If you''ve taken more than the recommended maximum dose, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible. It can be helpful to take any remaining medicine and the box or leaflet with you to A&E if you can. Some people feel sick, vomit or have abdominal (tummy) pain after taking too much paracetamol, but often there are no obvious symptoms at first. Go to A&E even if you''re feeling well.

(323, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/soothing-crying-baby.aspx', 'Crying baby', 'Soothing a crying baby - Pregnancy and baby guide - NHS Choices', '', 'All babies cry, and some cry a lot. Crying is your baby''s way of telling you they need comfort and care. Sometimes it''s easy to work out what they want, and sometimes it isn''t. The most common reasons for crying are: hunger a dirty or wet nappy tiredness wanting a cuddle wind being too hot or too cold boredom overstimulation There may be times of the day when your baby tends to cry a lot and can''t be comforted. Early evening is the most common time for this to happen. This can be hard for you, as it''s often the time when you''re most tired and least able to cope. The amount babies cry tends to peak at about seven weeks, then gradually tail off. How to calm a crying baby Crying during feeds If your baby cries constantly Getting help with a crying baby Never shake your baby How to calm a crying baby Try some of the following ways to comfort your baby. Some may work better than others: If you''re breastfeeding, let your baby suckle at your breast. If you''re bottle feeding, give your baby a dummy. Sterilise dummies as you would bottles. To avoid tooth decay, don''t dip them in anything sweet. Some babies use their thumb instead. Some older babies like to use a bit of cloth or a blanket as a comforter. Hold your baby or put them in a sling so they''re close to you. Move about gently, sway and dance, talk to them and sing. Rock your baby backwards and forwards in the pram, or go out for a walk or a drive. Lots of babies like to sleep in cars. Even if they wake up again when you stop, at least you''ll have had a break. Find something for them to listen to or look at. This could be music on the radio, a CD, a rattle, or a mobile above the cot. Try stroking your baby''s back firmly and rhythmically, holding them against you or lying face downwards on your lap. Undress your baby and massage them gently and firmly. Avoid using any oils or lotions until your baby is at least a month old. Talk soothingly as you do it and keep the room warm enough. Some health centres and clinics run baby massage courses. For information, ask your midwife or health visitor. Try a warm bath. This calms some babies instantly, but makes others cry even more. Sometimes too much rocking and singing can keep your baby awake. You might find lying them down after a feed will help. Ask your health visitor for advice. Crying during feeds Some babies cry and seem unsettled around the time of a feed. If you''re breastfeeding, you may find that improving your baby''s positioning and attachment helps them settle. You can go to a breastfeeding drop-in and ask for help, or talk to your health visitor. It may be that something you''re eating or drinking is affecting your baby. If you think this is happening, try keeping a diary of what you eat and when the crying happens. If you see any patterns, talk to your health visitor. Crying during feeds can sometimes be a symptom of reflux, a common condition where babies bring back milk after feeds. Speak to your health visitor or GP for more information and advice. If your baby cries constantly There are several reasons that can cause a baby to cry excessively. It can be exhausting if you''ve tried everything and nothing seems to comfort your baby. Colic Excessive crying could be a sign that your baby has colic. Everyone agrees that colic exists, but nobody knows what causes it. Some doctors think it''s a kind of stomach cramp. The crying sounds miserable and distressed, and stops for a moment or two, then starts up again, which suggests it could be caused by waves of stomach pain. The crying can go on for some hours. There may be little you can do except try to comfort your baby and wait for the crying to pass. See some tips for coping with colic. Crying and illness If your baby is crying constantly and you can''t console or distract them, or the cry doesn''t sound like their normal cry, it can be a sign they are ill. Or they may be ill if they are crying and have other symptoms, such as a high temperature. If this is the case, contact your health visitor or GP. Get medical attention as soon as you can if your baby:   has much drier nappies than usual has a high temperature, but their hands and feet feel cold has a fit (seizure or convulsion) has blue, mottled, ashen (grey) or very pale skin breathes rapidly or makes a throaty noise while breathing, or seems to be working hard to breathe, perhaps sucking in their stomach under their ribcage has a spotty purple-red rash anywhere on the body – this could be a sign of meningitis See more signs of serious illness. If you think there''s something wrong, always follow your instincts. During the day, Monday to Friday, contact your GP surgery. At evenings and weekends you can call NHS 111 or your GP''s out-of-hours number. Getting help with a crying baby You can talk to a friend, your health visitor or GP, or contact the Cry-sis helpline on 08451 228 669, open 9am to 10pm, 7 days a week. You will be charged for your call.  Cry-sis can put you in touch with other parents who have been in the same situation. You can also visit the Cry-sis website for information on coping with crying babies.   If you decide to talk to your health visitor or GP, it can help to keep a record of how often and when your baby cries. For example, this might be after every feed or during the evening. This can help your health visitor or GP to work out if there is a particular cause for the crying. Keeping a record can also help you identify the times when you need extra support. You could think about possible changes to your routine. There may be times when you''re so tired and angry you feel like you can''t take any more. This happens to a lot of parents, so don''t be ashamed to ask for help. If you don''t have anyone who can take care of your baby for a short time and the crying is making you stressed, put your baby in their cot or pram, make sure they''re safe, close the door, go into another room and try to calm yourself down. Set a time limit – for example, 10 minutes – then go back. Never shake your baby No matter how frustrated you feel, you must never shake your baby. Shaking moves their head violently and can cause brain damage. Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video. How do I calm my crying baby?

(324, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Depression/Pages/psychotic-depression.aspx', 'Psychotic depression', 'Clinical depression - psychotic depression - NHS Choices', 'Psychotic depression  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', '  Some people who have severe clinical depression will also experience hallucinations and delusional thinking, the symptoms of psychosis. Depression with psychosis is known as psychotic depression. Symptoms of severe depression Someone with severe clinical depression feels sad and hopeless for most of the day, practically every day, and has no interest in anything. Getting through the day feels almost impossible. Other typical symptoms of severe depression are: fatigue (exhaustion) loss of pleasure in things disturbed sleep changes in appetite feeling worthless and guilty being unable to concentrate or being indecisive thoughts of death or suicide Read more about the psychological, physical and social symptoms of clinical depression. Symptoms of psychosis Having moments of psychosis (psychotic episodes) means experiencing: delusions – thoughts or beliefs that are unlikely to be true  hallucinations – hearing and, in some cases, feeling, smelling, seeing or tasting things that aren''t there; hearing voices is a common hallucination The delusions and hallucinations almost always reflect the person''s deeply depressed mood – for example, they may become convinced they''re to blame for something, or that they''ve committed a crime. "Psychomotor agitation" is also common. This means not being able to relax or sit still, and constantly fidgeting. At the other extreme, a person with psychotic depression may have "psychomotor retardation", where both their thoughts and physical movements slow down. People with psychotic depression have an increased risk of thinking about suicide. What causes psychotic depression? The cause of psychotic depression isn''t fully understood. It''s known that there''s no single cause of depression and it has many different triggers. For some, stressful life events such as bereavement, divorce, serious illness or financial worries can be the cause. Genes probably play a part, as severe depression can run in families, although it''s not known why some people also develop psychosis. Many people with psychotic depression will have experienced adversity in childhood, such as a traumatic event. Read more about the causes of clinical depression. Treating psychotic depression Treatment for psychotic depression involves: medication – a combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants can help relieve the symptoms of psychosis psychological therapies – the one-to-one talking therapy cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has proved effective in helping some people with psychosis social support – support with social needs, such as education, employment or accommodation The person may need to stay in hospital for a short period of time while they''re receiving treatment. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may sometimes be recommended if the person has severe depression and other treatments, including antidepressants, haven''t worked. Treatment is usually effective, but follow-up appointments so that the person can be closely monitored are usually required. Getting help for others People with psychosis are often unaware that they''re thinking and acting strangely. As a result of this lack of insight, it''s often down to the person''s friends, relatives or carers to seek help for them. If you''re concerned about someone and think they may have psychosis, you could contact their social worker or community mental health nurse if they''ve previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition. Contact the person''s GP if this is the first time they''ve shown symptoms of psychosis. If you think the person''s symptoms are placing them or others at possible risk of harm you can: take them to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if they agree call their GP or local out-of-hours GP call 999 to ask for an ambulance Further information The following websites provide further information and support: SANE Mind: psychotic experiences Driving If you''ve been diagnosed with psychotic depression, it''s your legal obligation to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).

(325, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/cosmetic-treatments-guide/Pages/surgical-fat-transfer.aspx', 'Fat transfer (graft), cosmetic surgery', 'Surgical fat transfer', '', 'A surgical fat transfer is cosmetic surgery to move fat from one part of the body to another. It''s also known as a ''fat graft'' or ''lipomodelling''. The aim is to remove unwanted fat from one area (such as the tummy or thighs) and use it to smoothen or increase the size of another area (such as the breasts or face). Although it''s a relatively minor procedure, choosing to have it done is a big decision. It can be expensive, the results can’t be guaranteed, and there are risks to consider. It''s a good idea to explore the other options for losing fat before you go ahead. You may also want to read "Is cosmetic surgery right for me?" Read on to find out: How much does it cost?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems   More information  How much does it cost? In the UK, a surgical fat transfer usually costs between £2,000 and £6,500, depending on the size of the area being treated. There may be additional costs for consultations, aftercare and any further treatment sessions you need. Where do I go? If you''re looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform a surgical fat transfer. All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC, which publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care.  You should also research the surgeon who is going to carry out your surgery. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor’s fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many operations they''ve performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong their own patient satisfaction rates Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? A surgical fat transfer can be carried out under either general anaesthetic or local anaesthetic. It involves three main stages: Removing the fat. Small incisions (cuts) are made in the skin and a thin tube is used to suck out small amounts of fat (similar to liposuction). The incisions are then closed with stitches and a small dressing placed over them. Preparing the fat. Special equipment is used to quickly spin the fat, to separate it from any blood and other fluids. Injecting the fat. A needle and syringe are used to inject small amounts of fat into the treatment area. The injections are given through tiny holes in the skin, so stitches aren’t usually needed. The procedure usually lasts a couple of hours. You may be able to go home soon after the procedure is finished, or you may need to stay in hospital overnight. If a large area is being treated, your treatment may need to be carried out over two or more sessions. You shouldn’t feel much pain during the procedure, but you may have some for a few days or weeks afterwards. You’ll be given painkillers if you need them. Recovery You’ll need to arrange for someone to drive you home after the procedure. You can start driving again when you’re able to do so without experiencing any discomfort. The treated areas will probably be quite bruised and swollen for a week or two. You may want to take a couple of weeks off work. It can take up to six months for a surgical fat transfer to fully take effect, as some of the injected fat may be reabsorbed by your body during the first few months after the procedure. Side effects to expect It’s common after a surgical fat transfer to have: significant bruising and swelling temporary numbness small scars – these will fade, but won’t completely disappear loss of some of the fat from the injected area during the first few months What could go wrong A surgical fat transfer is generally a safe procedure, but it can occasionally result in: a collection of blood underneath the skin (haematoma) death of fat tissue (fat necrosis) a blockage in a blood vessel caused by a piece of fat (fat embolism) air leaking into the space between your lungs and chest wall (pneumothorax) thick, obvious scars – sometimes known as hypertrophic scars Any operation also carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding developing a blood clot in a vein infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, people find the desired effect wasn’t achieved and feel they need another operation. What to do if you have problems Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. If you notice any problems during your recovery, such as signs of a possible infection (increasing swelling, redness or pain), go back to the surgeon who treated you. If you are not happy with the results, or think the procedure wasn''t carried out properly, you should take up the matter with your surgeon through the hospital or clinic where you were treated. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the GMC.

(326, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Rubella/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Rubella', 'Rubella - NHS Choices', 'Rubella  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Rubella (german measles) is a viral infection that''s now rare in the UK. It''s usually a mild condition that gets better without treatment in 7 to 10 days. Symptoms of rubella include: a red-pink skin rash made up of small spots swollen glands around the head and neck a high temperature (fever) cold-like symptoms such as a cough and runny nose aching and painful joints – more common in adults The symptoms of rubella usually only last a few days, but your glands may be swollen for several weeks. Read more about the symptoms of rubella. When to see your GP You should always contact your GP or NHS 111 if you suspect rubella. Don''t visit your GP surgery without phoning first, as arrangements may need to be made to reduce the risk of infecting others. If you''re pregnant and develop a rash or come into contact with someone who has a rash, contact your GP or midwife immediately. Read more about diagnosing rubella. Rubella and pregnancy Rubella usually only becomes a serious concern if a pregnant woman catches the infection during the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy. This is because the rubella virus can disrupt the development of the baby and cause a wide range of health problems, including: eye problems – such as cataracts (cloudy patches on the lens of the eye) deafness heart abnormalities brain damage The birth defects caused by the rubella virus are known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Since the introduction of the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine, CRS is now very rare in the UK. Read more about the complications of rubella. How it spreads Rubella is caused by a type of virus called a togavirus. It''s spread in a similar way to a cold or flu, through droplets of moisture from the nose or throat of someone who''s infected. These droplets are released into the air when someone coughs, sneezes or talks. You can become infected if you come into contact with the droplets from an infected person, although it can take two to three weeks for symptoms to develop. If you have rubella, you''ll be infectious to other people from one week before symptoms develop, and for up to four days after the rash first appeared. You should stay away from school or work for four days after the rash starts to avoid infecting others, and try to avoid contact with pregnant women during this time. Who''s affected? Rubella is rare in the UK nowadays. Most cases occur in people who came to the UK from countries that don''t offer routine immunisation against rubella. However, there can occasionally be large outbreaks of rubella in the UK. One of these occurred in 1996, when there were almost 4,000 cases in England and Wales. There were 12 confirmed cases of rubella in England and Wales in 2013. Treating rubella There''s no specific treatment for rubella, but symptoms normally pass within 7 to 10 days. If you or your child are finding the symptoms uncomfortable, you can treat some of these at home while you wait for the infection to pass. For example, paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to reduce the fever and treat any aches or pains. Liquid infant paracetamol can be used for young children. Aspirin shouldn''t be given to children under the age of 16 years. Read more about treating rubella. Preventing rubella The best way to prevent rubella is to be immunised with the MMR vaccine. Children are offered this vaccine as part of the routine childhood immunisation programme. It''s given in two doses – the first when the child is one year old, followed by a second booster dose before they start school, at three years and four months. Routine vaccination is important because it reduces the risk of large outbreaks and helps protect pregnant women and their babies. The MMR vaccine can also be given to older children and adults who haven''t been fully immunised before. Contact your GP if you''re uncertain whether you or your child are up-to-date with vaccinations. If you''re thinking of getting pregnant and you''re not sure whether you''ve had two doses of the MMR vaccine, it''s a good idea to check with your GP practice. If your records show you haven''t had two doses of MMR or there''s no record, ask for the vaccinations. Read more about preventing rubella. Information about you If you or your child has rubella, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

(327, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/red-eye/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'red eyes', 'Red eye - NHS Choices', 'Red eye  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', '  A red eye can be alarming, but is often just a sign of a minor eye condition, such as conjunctivitis or a burst blood vessel. If it''s painful, there may be a more serious problem.  See your GP for advice if your red eye doesn''t start to improve after a few days. Contact your GP or NHS 111 immediately, or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if: you have a painful red eye you have other symptoms, including reduced vision, sensitivity to light, a severe headache and feeling sick you recently injured your eye – particularly if something has pierced your eye This page aims to give you a better idea of what might be causing your red eye. However, it shouldn''t be used to self-diagnose your condition. Always see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment. Common causes of a painless red eye The most likely causes of a painless red eye are minor problems such as conjunctivitis or a burst blood vessel. These conditions don''t tend to affect your vision and normally get better within a week or two. Conjunctivitis Conjunctivitis is inflammation (swelling and irritation) of the conjunctiva – the thin layer of tissue covering the eyeball and inner surfaces of the eyelids. This causes the blood vessels on the eye to swell, making one or both eyes look bloodshot and feel gritty. Other symptoms can include itchiness and watering of the eyes, and a sticky coating on the eyelashes. Conjunctivitis can be caused by an infection, an allergy (for example, to pollen), or an irritant, such as chlorine or dust. Treatment will depend on what is causing the condition. Sometimes no treatment is needed, because it may get better on its own.  Your doctor may recommend: regularly cleaning away any crusting or discharge not wearing contact lenses until the condition passes washing your hands regularly and avoiding sharing pillows or towels to help prevent the condition spreading to others (if it''s infectious) antibiotic eye drops for bacterial infections or medications, such as antihistamines for allergies Read more about treating conjunctivitis. Burst blood vessel in the eye Straining, coughing or injuring your eye can sometimes cause a blood vessel to burst on the eye surface, causing a bright red blotch. This is called a subconjunctival haemorrhage. It can look alarming, especially if you''re taking medication such as aspirin or warfarin (these reduce the blood''s ability to clot, which can exaggerate the redness), but it''s not usually serious and should clear up on its own within a few weeks. Common causes of a painful red eye If your red eye is painful or you have other symptoms such as reduced vision, the cause is likely to be one of the below conditions. These conditions can sometimes be serious and could threaten your sight, so they should be assessed by a doctor as soon as possible. Iritis  Iritis is inflammation of the iris (the coloured part of the eye). It''s also known as anterior uveitis. As well as a red eye, you may notice that your eye is sensitive to light, your vision is blurred and you have a headache. Often, no cause is identified, although iritis can sometimes be caused by an underlying problem with the immune system or an infection. Iritis usually responds quickly to treatment with steroid medication to reduce the inflammation. It rarely leads to severe problems. Acute glaucoma Acute glaucoma is a serious condition where there is a sudden increase in pressure inside your eye. Your eye will probably be severely red and painful, and you may feel sick and see halos around lights. Your vision may be blurred or cloudy. If your GP thinks you may have acute glaucoma, they will refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) immediately, because the condition could potentially lead to permanent loss of vision if it''s not treated quickly. Corneal ulcer (ulcer on the cornea) An ulcer on the cornea (the clear outer layer at the front of the eyeball) is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection. It can cause the eye to become red and sensitive to light, and it can feel like there''s something in your eye. Bacterial corneal ulcers are usually seen in people who wear contact lenses. Viral corneal ulcers are often seen in people who frequently get cold sores. If your GP thinks you have a corneal ulcer, they will refer you to an eye specialist for treatment. A scratch to the cornea or particle in the eye A red and painful eye can sometimes be caused by a particle, such as a piece of grit, getting in your eye. If there''s something in your eye, your GP or a hospital doctor at an accident and emergency (A&E) department will try to remove it. They will first put anaesthetic eye drops into your eye to numb it and reduce any pain. If the particle has scratched your eye, it may feel a bit uncomfortable when the anaesthetic eye drops have worn off. You may be given antibiotic eye drops or ointment to use for a few days to reduce the risk of infection while it heals. Read more about eye injuries.

The 4-in-1 pre-school booster vaccine increases their immunity even further. When should children have the 4-in-1 booster vaccine? The 4-in-1 booster vaccine is routinely offered to children at the age of three years and four months old.   How is the 4-in-1 vaccine given? It''s injected into the child''s upper arm. Can the 4-in-1 pre-school booster vaccine be given with other vaccines? The pre-school booster can be given at the same time as other vaccines. It''s usually given at the same time as the second dose of the MMR vaccine. This NHS leaflet tells you more about pre-school immunisations (PDF, 835kb). How well does the 4-in-1 pre-school booster work? Studies have shown that the pre-school booster is very effective. In clinical tests, more than 99% of children who had been given the 4-in-1 pre-school booster were protected against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and polio. The vaccine protects children from these infections until they receive their teenage 3-in-1 booster at the age of 14.  The 4-in-1 vaccine not only protects your child against these infections, but also stops them passing the germs on to babies who are too young to have had all of their vaccinations. How safe is the 4-in-1 booster vaccine? Before anyone can be given a vaccine, it has to go through many tests to check that it is safe and that it works. However, the 4-in-1 pre-school booster, like other vaccines, can have side effects in some children. Side effects of the 4-in-1 vaccine are usually mild. Your child may get a little redness, swelling or tenderness where the injection was given that will disappear on its own. This NHS leaflet tells you about common vaccination reactions in young children up to five years of age (PDF, 118kb). There are two different 4-in-1 vaccines that are used in the UK – Infanrix IPV and REPEVAX. Both vaccines provide good booster responses, so it doesn''t matter which one your child is given as their pre-school booster.  Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for Infanrix IPV (PDF, 68kb). Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for REPEVAX (PDF, 30kb). Read more about the 4-in-1 pre-school booster side effects. Which children can''t have the 4-in-1 booster vaccine? The vast majority of children can have the 4-in-1 booster vaccine, but there are a few children who shouldn''t have it. They include children who: are allergic to the vaccine have a fever at the time of the vaccination appointment The vaccine should not be given to children who have had an anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) to any part of the vaccine before. There is no need to postpone vaccination if your child has a minor illness, such as a cough or a cold with no fever. But if your baby is ill with a fever, it''s best to delay vaccination until they have recovered. Why is inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) used rather than oral polio vaccine (OPV), as in the past? Oral polio vaccine (OPV) was used from the 1960s because the live vaccine provided better community-wide protection against polio. Now that polio has been wiped out from large parts of the world, the risk of polio is so low that it is an appropriate time to switch to inactivated polio vaccine, which is given as an injection and does not carry the risk of paralytic polio. Can you get polio from the polio part of this vaccine? The 4-in-1 pre-school booster uses inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot cause polio.  Page last reviewed: 18/05/2016 Next review due: 18/05/2018 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

(329, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/dehydration/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'dehydration', 'Dehydration - NHS Choices', 'Dehydration  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid than you take in. When the normal water content of your body is reduced, it upsets the balance of minerals (salts and sugar) in your body, which affects the way it functions. Water makes up over two-thirds of the healthy human body. It lubricates the joints and eyes, aids digestion, flushes out waste and toxins, and keeps the skin healthy. Some of the early warning signs of dehydration include: feeling thirsty and lightheaded a dry mouth tiredness having dark coloured, strong-smelling urine passing urine less often than usual A baby may be dehydrated if they: have a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head have few or no tears when they cry have fewer wet nappies are drowsy The body is affected even when you lose a small amount of fluid. Read more about the symptoms of dehydration. What causes dehydration? Dehydration is usually caused by not drinking enough fluid to replace what we lose. The climate, the amount of physical exercise you are doing (particularly in hot weather) and your diet can contribute to dehydration. You can also become dehydrated as a result of an illness, such as persistent vomiting and diarrhoea, or sweating from a fever. Read more about the causes of dehydration. Who is at risk from dehydration? Anyone can become dehydrated, but certain groups are particularly at risk. These include: babies and infants – they have a low body weight and are sensitive to even small amounts of fluid loss older people – they may be less aware that they are becoming dehydrated and need to keep drinking fluids people with a long-term health condition – such as diabetes or alcoholism athletes – they can lose a large amount of body fluid through sweat when exercising for long periods  What to do If you''re dehydrated, drink plenty of fluids such as water, diluted squash or fruit juice. These are much more effective than large amounts of tea or coffee. Fizzy drinks may contain more sugar than you need and may be harder to take in large amounts. If you''re finding it difficult to keep water down because you''re vomiting, try drinking small amounts more frequently. Infants and small children who are dehydrated shouldn''t be given large amounts of water alone as the main replacement fluid. This is because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body too much and lead to other problems. Instead, they should be given diluted squash or a rehydration solution (available from pharmacies). You might find a teaspoon or syringe can be helpful for getting fluid into a young child. If left untreated, severe dehydration can be serious and cause fits (seizures), brain damage and death. Read more about treating dehydration. When to see your GP See your GP if your symptoms continue, despite drinking plenty of fluids, or if you think your baby or toddler is dehydrated. If your GP suspects dehydration, you may have a blood test or a urine test to check the balance of salts (sodium and potassium) in your body. Contact your GP, out-of-hours service or NHS 111 straight away if you have any of the following symptoms: extreme thirst feeling unusually tired (lethargic) or confused not passing urine for eight hours rapid heartbeat dizziness when you stand up that doesn''t go away after a few seconds You should also contact your GP if your baby has had six or more episodes of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours, or if they have vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours.  How much should I drink? Studies have tried to establish a recommended daily fluid intake, but it can vary depending on the individual and factors such as age, climate and physical activity. A good rule is to drink enough fluid so that you''re not thirsty for long periods, and to steadily increase your fluid intake when exercising and during hot weather. Passing clear urine (wee) is a good sign that you''re well hydrated. You should drink plenty of fluid if you have symptoms of dehydration, such as feeling thirsty and lightheaded, or passing dark-coloured urine. It is also important to replace fluid lost after an episode of diarrhoea.  Page last reviewed: 13/04/2015 Next review due: 01/04/2018', -290361331),
(330, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pneumonia/Pages/Introduction.aspx', '(pneumonia)', 'Pneumonia - NHS Choices', 'Pneumonia  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', '  Pneumonia is swelling (inflammation) of the tissue in one or both lungs. It''s usually caused by a bacterial infection. At the end of the breathing tubes in your lungs are clusters of tiny air sacs. If you have pneumonia, these tiny sacs become inflamed and fill up with fluid. Symptoms of pneumonia The symptoms of pneumonia can develop suddenly over 24 to 48 hours, or they may come on more slowly over several days. Common symptoms of pneumonia include: a cough – which may be dry, or produce thick yellow, green, brown or blood-stained mucus (phlegm) difficulty breathing – your breathing may be rapid and shallow, and you may feel breathless, even when resting rapid heartbeat fever feeling generally unwell sweating and shivering loss of appetite chest pain – which gets worse when breathing or coughing Less common symptoms include: coughing up blood (haemoptysis) headaches fatigue nausea or vomiting wheezing joint and muscle pain feeling confused and disorientated, particularly in elderly people When to see your GP See your GP if you feel unwell and you have typical symptoms of pneumonia. Seek urgent medical attention if you''re experiencing severe symptoms, such as rapid breathing, chest pain or confusion. Who''s affected? In the UK, pneumonia affects around 8 in 1,000 adults each year. It''s more widespread in autumn and winter. Pneumonia can affect people of any age, but it''s more common – and can be more serious – in certain groups of people, such as the very young or the elderly. People in these groups are more likely to need hospital treatment if they develop pneumonia. What causes pneumonia? Pneumonia is usually the result of a pneumococcal infection, caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. Many different types of bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, can also cause pneumonia, as well as viruses and, more rarely, fungi. As well as bacterial pneumonia, other types include: viral pneumonia – most commonly caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and sometimes influenza type A or B; viruses are a common cause of pneumonia in young children aspiration pneumonia – caused by breathing in vomit, a foreign object, such as a peanut, or a harmful substance, such as smoke or a chemical fungal pneumonia – rare in the UK and more likely to affect people with a weakened immune system hospital-acquired pneumonia – pneumonia that develops in hospital while being treated for another condition or having an operation; people in intensive care on breathing machines are particularly at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia Risk groups The following groups have an increased risk of developing pneumonia: babies and very young children elderly people people who smoke people with other health conditions, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, or a heart, kidney or liver condition people with a weakened immune system – for example, as a result of a recent illness, such as flu, having HIV or AIDS, having chemotherapy, or taking medication following an organ transplant Diagnosing pneumonia Your GP may be able to diagnose pneumonia by asking about your symptoms and examining your chest. Further tests may be needed in some cases. Pneumonia can be difficult to diagnose because it shares many symptoms with other conditions, such as the common cold, bronchitis and asthma. To help make a diagnosis, your GP may ask you: whether you feel breathless or you''re breathing faster than usual how long you''ve had your cough, and whether you''re coughing up mucus and what colour it is if the pain in your chest is worse when you breathe in or out Your GP may also take your temperature and listen to your chest and back with a stethoscope to check for any crackling or rattling sounds. They may also listen to your chest by tapping it. Lungs filled with fluid produce a different sound from normal healthy lungs. If you have mild pneumonia, you probably won''t need to have a chest X-ray or any other tests. You may need a chest X-ray or other tests, such as a sputum (mucus) test or blood tests, if your symptoms haven''t improved within 48 hours of starting treatment. Treating pneumonia Mild pneumonia can usually be treated at home by: getting plenty of rest taking antibiotics drinking plenty of fluids If you don''t have any other health problems, you should respond well to treatment and soon recover, although your cough may last for some time. As pneumonia isn''t usually passed from one person to another, it''s safe to be around others, including family members. However, people with a weakened immune system should avoid close contact with a person with pneumonia until they start to get better. For at-risk groups, pneumonia can be severe and may need to be treated in hospital. This is because it can lead to serious complications, which in some cases can be fatal, depending on a person''s health and age. Read more about treating pneumonia. Complications of pneumonia Complications of pneumonia are more common in young children, the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions, such as diabetes. Possible complications of pneumonia include: pleurisy – where the thin linings between your lungs and ribcage (pleura) become inflamed, which can lead to respiratory failure a lung abscess – a rare complication that''s mostly seen in people with a serious pre-existing illness or a history of severe alcohol misuse blood poisoning (septicaemia) – also a rare but serious complication You''ll be admitted to hospital for treatment if you develop one of these complications. Preventing pneumonia Although most cases of pneumonia are bacterial and aren''t passed on from one person to another, ensuring good standards of hygiene will help prevent germs spreading. For example, you should: cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or tissue when you cough or sneeze  throw away used tissues immediately – germs can live for several hours after they leave your nose or mouth wash your hands regularly to avoid transferring germs to other people or objects A healthy lifestyle can also help prevent pneumonia. For example, you should avoid smoking as it damages your lungs and increases the chance of infection. Find out how to stop smoking. Excessive and prolonged alcohol misuse also weakens your lungs'' natural defences against infections, making you more vulnerable to pneumonia. People at high risk of pneumonia should be offered the pneumococcal vaccine and flu vaccine. Page last reviewed: 11/05/2016 Next review due: 01/05/2019', 567003918),

How often should my unborn baby move? Media last reviewed: 20/03/2014 Next review due: 20/03/2017 Contacting your midwife or GP When you first learn that you''re pregnant, get in touch with a midwife or GP as soon as possible. Ideally this should be by 10 weeks of your pregnancy. Telling your GP and/or midwife promptly will help to make sure you receive maternity healthcare that takes into account all your health needs and preferences. Find maternity units in your area. You can read all the information on this page, or click on the links below to go straight to the relevant section: What is antenatal care? Starting your antenatal care How many appointments you''ll have Your first visit and booking appointment Later visits Checking your baby''s development and wellbeing Your maternity notes What is antenatal care? Antenatal care is the care you receive from healthcare professionals during your pregnancy. You''ll be offered a series of appointments with a midwife, or sometimes with a doctor who specialises in pregnancy and birth (an obstetrician). They will check that you and your baby are well, give you useful information to help you have a healthy pregnancy (including healthy eating and exercise advice) and answer any questions you may have. You will also be offered antenatal classes, including breastfeeding workshops. You need to book antenatal classes in advance, so ask your midwife about when you should book classes in your area. Starting antenatal care You can book an appointment with your GP or directly with your midwife as soon as you know that you''re pregnant. Your GP surgery or a Children’s Centre can put you in touch with your nearest midwifery service.  It''s best to see them as early as possible to obtain the information you need to have a healthy pregnancy, and because some tests, such as screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia should be done before you''re 10 weeks'' pregnant. If you have special health needs, your midwife, GP or obstetrician may take shared responsibility for your maternity care. This means they will all see you during your pregnancy. Let your midwife know if you have a disability that means you have special requirements for your antenatal appointments or for labour. If you don''t speak English, let your midwife know and arrangements will be made. Antenatal appointments If you''re expecting your first child, you''ll have up to 10 antenatal appointments. If you''ve had a baby before, you''ll have around seven antenatal appointments. Under certain circumstances, for example if you develop a medical condition, you may have more. Early in your pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will give you written information about how many appointments you''re likely to have and when they''ll happen. You should have a chance to discuss the schedule with them. If you can''t keep an antenatal appointment, let the clinic or midwife know and make another appointment. Your appointments can take place at your home, in a Children''s Centre, in your GP surgery or in hospital. You will usually go to the hospital for your scans. Your antenatal appointments should take place in a setting where you feel able to discuss sensitive issues that may affect you, such as domestic violence, sexual abuse, mental illness or drugs. To give you the best pregnancy care, your midwife will ask you many questions about your health, your family''s health and your preferences. Your midwife will do some checks and tests, some of which will be done throughout your pregnancy. The results of these tests may affect your choices later in pregnancy, so it’s important not to miss them. Your midwife will also ask about any other social care support you may have or need, such as support from social workers or family liaison officers. Your first visit Your first visit with your midwife or GP is the appointment when you tell them that you''re pregnant. At this first visit, you will be given information about:  folic acid and vitamin D supplements nutrition, diet and food hygiene lifestyle factors that may affect your health or the health of your baby, such as smoking, recreational drug use and drinking alcohol  antenatal screening tests, including screening for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia, infectious diseases and screening for Down''s syndrome. You should be offered screening for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia before 10 weeks. This is so you and your partner can find out about all your options and make an informed decision if your baby is at risk of inheriting one of these conditions. They will give you information on keeping healthy, and ask whether you have had any previous health or pregnancy issues, such as complications in pregnancy. It''s important to tell your midwife or doctor if: you''ve had any complications or infections in a previous pregnancy or delivery, such as pre-eclampsia or premature birth  you''re being treated for a chronic disease, such as diabetes or high blood pressure  you or anyone in your family have previously had a baby with an abnormality, such as spina bifida  there''s a family history of an inherited disease, such as sickle cell or cystic fibrosis you know that you are a genetic carrier for an inherited condition such as sickle cell or thalassaemia. You should also tell the midwife if you know the baby''s biological father is a genetic carrier for one of these conditions you have had fertility treatment and either a donor egg or donor sperm An important part of antenatal care is getting information that will help you to make informed choices about your pregnancy. Your midwife or doctor will give you information in writing or some other form that you can easily use and understand. They can provide you with information in an appropriate format if you:  have a physical, learning or sensory disability do not speak English The booking appointment Your next appointment should happen when you are 8-12 weeks pregnant. This is called the booking appointment. It will last for up to two hours, and could take place either at a hospital or in the community, for example in a clinic at a health centre, in a GP surgery or at home. You''ll see a midwife and sometimes a doctor. You may also be offered an ultrasound scan. You will be given information about: how the baby develops during pregnancy (see the pregnancy development slideshow) nutrition and diet general exercise and pelvic floor exercises antenatal screening tests your antenatal care and antenatal classes breastfeeding workshops  maternity and paternity benefits  planning your labour and where to have your baby  The midwife or doctor will ask questions to build up a picture of you and your pregnancy. This is to make sure you''re given the support you need, and so that any risks are spotted early. You will probably want to ask a lot of questions. It often helps to write down what you want to say in advance, as it’s easy to forget once you''re there. It’s important to find out what you want to know and to talk about your own feelings and preferences. Several antenatal screening tests are performed on a sample of your blood which is usually taken at your booking appointment.  Questions you might be asked The midwife or doctor might ask about: the date of the first day of your last period  your health any previous illnesses and operations any previous pregnancies and miscarriages  ethnic origins of you and your partner, to find out whether your baby is at risk of certain inherited conditions, or other relevant factors, such as whether your family has a history of twins your job or your partner''s job, and what kind of accommodation you live in to see whether your circumstances might affect your pregnancy how you''re feeling and whether you''ve been feeling depressed Your booking appointment is an opportunity to tell your midwife or doctor if you''re in a vulnerable situation or if you need extra support. This could be due to domestic abuse or violence, sexual abuse or female genital mutilation. Later antenatal visits From around 24 weeks, your antenatal appointments will usually become more frequent. However, if your pregnancy is uncomplicated and you are in good health, you may not be seen as often as someone who needs to be more closely monitored. Later visits are usually quite short. Your midwife or doctor will:  check your urine and blood pressure feel your abdomen (tummy) to check the baby''s position measure your uterus (womb) to check your baby''s growth listen to your baby''s heartbeat if you want them to You can also ask questions or talk about anything that''s worrying you. Talking about your feelings is as important as all the antenatal tests and examinations. You should be given information about: your birth plan  preparing for labour and birth how to tell if you''re in active labour induction of labour if your baby is overdue (after your expected date of delivery)  the "baby blues" and postnatal depression feeding your baby vitamin K (which is given to prevent bleeding caused by vitamin K deficiency in your baby) screening tests for newborn babies looking after yourself and your new baby The NICE antenatal care guidelines (from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) give useful information on the timing of visits during pregnancy and a description of what will happen each time. Checking your baby''s development and wellbeing At each antenatal appointment from 24 weeks of pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will check your baby''s growth. To do this, they''ll measure the distance from the top of your womb to your pubic bone. The measurement will be recorded in your notes. In the last weeks of pregnancy, you may also be asked to keep track of your baby''s movements. If your baby''s movements become less frequent, slow down or stop, contact your midwife or doctor immediately. You''ll be offered an ultrasound scan if they have any concerns about how your baby is growing and developing. Your maternity notes At your booking appointment, your midwife will enter your details in a record book and will add to them at each visit. These are your maternity notes, sometimes called handheld notes. You’ll be asked to keep your maternity notes at home and to bring them along to all your antenatal appointments. Take your notes with you wherever you go in case you need medical attention while you''re away from home. Always ask your maternity team to explain anything in your notes that you don''t understand. Waiting times in clinics can vary, and having to wait a long time for an appointment can be particularly difficult if you have young children with you. Planning ahead can make your visits easier, so here are some suggestions:  Write a list of any questions you want to ask and take it with you. Make sure you get answers to your questions or the opportunity to discuss any worries. If your partner is free, they may be able to go with you. This can make them feel more involved in the pregnancy. In some clinics you can buy refreshments. If not, take a snack with you if you''re likely to get hungry. Find out about your schedule of antenatal appointments and what to expect at each one. Page last reviewed: 08/01/2015 Next review due: 08/01/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

They can include: a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above extreme tiredness sore throat  swollen glands muscle and joint pain loss of appetite hepatitis (inflammation of the liver)  These symptoms will usually last for a couple of weeks. If CMV recurs in someone who''s otherwise healthy, including during pregnancy, it will cause few, if any, symptoms. Weakened immune system Active CMV infection in someone with a weakened immune system can cause a wide range of symptoms, including: a high temperature diarrhoea  shortness of breath  visual problems – such as blind spots, blurring and floaters pneumonia (lung infection) retinitis – inflammation of the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye) hepatitis  These symptoms occur because the virus can quickly spread throughout the body, damaging one or more organs, particularly the digestive system, lungs and eyes. Contact your GP or treatment team immediately if you have one or more of the above symptoms and your immune system is weakened by HIV or organ transplantation. Congenital CMV Around 13% of babies born with congenital CMV will have symptoms at birth. A similar number of babies who don''t have symptoms at birth will develop problems at a later stage. Symptoms at birth Symptoms of congenital CMV at birth can include: jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) pneumonia a rash consisting of small, purplish spots an enlarged liver and spleen low birth weight seizures (fits) small head  Some of these symptoms can be treated, but some babies will develop long-term conditions as a result of the infection. Long-term problems A small proportion of babies with congenital CMV (including those with no symptoms at birth) will develop one or more physical or mental problems at a later stage. These can include: hearing loss (see below) visual impairment or blindness learning difficulties dyspraxia (lack of physical co-ordination) epilepsy CMV infection is responsible for around 25% of cases of hearing loss during childhood. Hearing loss caused by congenital CMV may develop during the first few years of life. This usually gets worse over time. It can also be permanent and range from mild to total. The hearing problems can affect either one or both ears. Children with hearing loss in both ears are also likely to experience difficulties with speech and communication as they get older.

(333, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/cosmetic-treatments-guide/Pages/dermal-fillers.aspx', 'Dermal fillers', 'Dermal fillers', '', 'Dermal fillers are injections used to fill out wrinkles and creases in the skin. They can also be used to increase the volume and definition of the lips and cheeks. The fillers are made from a variety of materials and the effects can be either temporary or permanent, depending on the type of filler: collagen – effects last three to four months hyaluronic acid – lasts about four to six months calcium hydroxylapatite – lasts about 18 months poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) – effects of injections given over several months may last up to two years polymethylmethacrylate beads (PMMA) – permanent, but most risky Before you go ahead If you''re considering dermal fillers, be certain about why you want to have them.  The procedure can be expensive and has its limitations. Cost: In the UK, facial fillers cost about £150 to £300 per session, depending on the amount of product used. Limitations: Most fillers aren''t permanent. There''s no guarantee the desired effect will be achieved. The ageing process will still happen elsewhere – fillers will not, for example, fix a sagging jawline. Safety: Take time to find a reputable practitioner who is properly qualified and practises in a clean, safe and appropriate environment. Ask the practitioner what you should do if something were to go wrong. What it involves You may be offered a local anaesthetic cream or injection. The practitioner injects the filler in a series of small injections and may massage the area. The treatment time can vary from 30 minutes to an hour. It may be uncomfortable, but should not be very painful. Afterwards The area may be a little swollen, tender and red for 24 hours. During that time you may be advised to avoid coffee, alcohol, hot drinks and the sun. Risks The risks of dermal fillers depend on whether the procedure was done correctly and the type of filler used. Permanent fillers have the highest risk of problems and some practitioners feel they are best avoided. General risks of dermal fillers include: rashes, swelling, itching and bruising an infection the filler moving away from the intended treatment area over time (in rare cases) the filler forming lumps under the skin – this may need to be treated with surgery or medication (in rare cases) the filler blocking a blood vessel – this can lead to tissue death, permanent blindness or a pulmonary embolism What to do if you have problems If you''ve had fillers and are not happy with the results or are experiencing problems such as lumpiness, take up the matter with your practitioner through the clinic where you were treated. If there are any complications that require medical attention, it is best that you go back to the practitioner who treated you. If this is not possible, you can go to your GP or local accident and emergency (A&E) department. You can also report any side effects directly through the Yellow Card Scheme website. By reporting side effects, you are helping to provide more information on the safety of this medicine.

There are two types:  the emergency contraceptive pill (sometimes called the morning after pill) the IUD (intrauterine device, or coil) At a glance: emergency contraception   The emergency pill    The IUD as emergency contraception   Where to get emergency contraception   Contraception for the future There are two kinds of emergency contraceptive pill. Levonelle has to be taken within 72 hours (three days) of sex, and ellaOne has to be taken within 120 hours (five days) of sex. Both work by preventing or delaying ovulation (release of an egg). The IUD can be inserted into your uterus up to five days after unprotected sex, or up to five days after the earliest time you could have ovulated. It may stop an egg from being fertilised or implanting in your womb. Emergency contraception does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). At a glance: facts about emergency contraception Both types of emergency contraception are effective at preventing pregnancy if they are used soon after unprotected sex. Less than 1% of women who use the IUD get pregnant, whereas pregnancies after the emergency contraceptive pill are not as rare. It’s thought that ellaOne is more effective than Levonelle. The sooner you take Levonelle or ellaOne, the more effective it will be. Levonelle or ellaOne can make you feel sick, dizzy or tired, or give you a headache, tender breasts or abdominal pain. Levonelle or ellaOne can make your period earlier or later than usual. If you’re sick (vomit) within two hours of taking Levonelle, or three hours of taking ellaOne, seek medical advice as you will need to take another dose or have an IUD fitted. If you use the IUD as emergency contraception, it can be left in as your regular contraceptive method. If you use the IUD as a regular method of contraception, it can make your periods longer, heavier or more painful. You may feel some discomfort when the IUD is put in – painkillers can help to relieve this. There are no serious side effects of using emergency contraception. Emergency contraception does not cause an abortion. The emergency pill How the emergency pill works How effective the emergency pill is at preventing pregnancy How it affects your period  Who can use the emergency pill  During breastfeeding If you''re already using the pill, patch, vaginal ring or injection Side effects of the emergency pill The emergency pill and other medicines Can I get the emergency pill in advance? How the emergency pill works Levonelle Levonelle contains levonorgestrel, a synthetic version of the natural hormone progesterone. In a woman’s body, progesterone plays a role in ovulation and preparing the uterus for accepting a fertilised egg. It’s not known exactly how Levonelle works, but it’s thought to work primarily by preventing or delaying ovulation. It does not interfere with your regular method of contraception. ellaOne ellaOne contains ulipristal acetate, which stops progesterone working normally. It prevents pregnancy mainly by preventing or delaying ovulation.` Levonelle and ellaOne do not continue to protect you against pregnancy. This means that if you have unprotected sex at any time after taking the emergency pill you can become pregnant. Even if you are starting or continuing another method of hormonal contraception, it may not be effective immediately. You will need to use condoms or avoid sex until the contraception is working effectively. The time it takes for contraception to become effective depends on the emergency contraceptive pill and the method of hormonal contraception being started. Your doctor or nurse will tell you when you can start hormonal contraception and how long you will need to take additional precautions to prevent an unintended pregnancy. Levonelle and ellaOne are not intended to be used as a regular form of contraception. However, you can use emergency contraception more than once in a menstrual cycle if necessary. How effective is the emergency pill at preventing pregnancy? You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people''s services some pharmacies  Find a clinic near you It can be difficult to know how many pregnancies the emergency pill prevents, because there is no way to know for sure how many women would have got pregnant if they did not take it. A study published in 2010 showed that of 1,696 women who received the emergency pill within 72 hours of sex, 37 became pregnant (1,659 did not). Of 203 women who took the emergency pill between 72 and 120 hours after unprotected sex, there were three pregnancies. Find out more about the research on the effectiveness of both emergency contraception pills. However, it''s important to remember that the sooner you take emergency contraception after sex, the more effective it will be. How it affects your period After taking the emergency contraceptive pill, most women will have a normal period at the expected time. However, you may have your period later or earlier than normal. If your period is more than seven days late, or is unusually light or short, contact your GP as soon as possible to check for pregnancy. Who can use the emergency pill? Most women can use the emergency contraceptive pill. This includes women who cannot usually use hormonal contraception, such as the combined pill and contraceptive patch. Girls aged under 16 years old can also use the emergency contraceptive pill. Levonelle The WHO does not identify any medical condition that would mean a woman shouldn’t use Levonelle. ellaOne The manufacturer of ellaOne advises that it should not be used by women who:  are allergic to any of the components of the drug have severe asthma that is treated with glucocorticoids (steroid) tablets have certain rare hereditary problems with lactose metabolism ellaOne may not be effective in women who are taking liver enzyme-inducing medication. For more information, read The emergency pill and other medicines. Breastfeeding Levonelle Levonelle can be taken while breastfeeding. Although small amounts of the hormones contained in the pill may pass into your breast milk, it is not thought to be harmful to your baby. ellaOne The safety of ellaOne during breastfeeding is not yet known. The manufacturer recommends that you do not breastfeed for one week after taking this pill. If you are already using the pill, patch, vaginal ring or contraceptive injection You may need to take the emergency pill if you: forgot to take some of your regular contraceptive pills, or did not use your contraceptive patch or vaginal ring correctly, or were late having your contraceptive implant or contraceptive injection If you have taken Levonelle, then you should:  take your next contraceptive pill, apply a new patch or insert a new ring within 12 hours of taking the emergency pill You should then continue taking your regular contraceptive pill as normal. You will need to use additional contraception, such as condoms, for: the next seven days if you use the patch, ring, combined pill (except Qlaira), implant or injection nine days for the combined pill Qlaira  the next two days if you use the progestogen-only pill If you have taken ellaOne, you will need to wait at least five days before taking your next contraceptive pill, applying a new patch or inserting a new ring. You should then use additional contraception, such as condoms, while waiting to restart your contraceptive method and then for: the next seven days if you use the patch, ring, combined pill (except Qlaira), implant or injection nine days for the combined pill Qlaira  the next two days if you use the progestogen-only pill What are the side effects of using the emergency pill? Taking the emergency contraceptive pill has not been shown to cause any serious or long-term health problems. However, it can sometimes have side effects. Common side effects include:  abdominal (tummy) pain headache irregular menstrual bleeding (spotting or heavy bleeding) before your next period is due feeling sick tiredness Less common side effects include: breast tenderness dizziness headache vomiting (seek medical advice if you vomit within two hours of taking Levonelle, or three hours of taking ellaOne, as you will need to take another dose or have an IUD fitted) If you are concerned about any symptoms after taking the emergency contraceptive pill, contact your GP or speak to a nurse at a sexual health clinic. You should talk to a doctor or nurse if:  you think you might be pregnant your next period is more than seven days late your period is shorter or lighter than usual you have any sudden or unusual pain in your lower abdomen (this could be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy, where a fertilised egg implants outside the womb – this is rare but serious, and needs immediate medical attention)  The emergency pill and other medicines The emergency contraceptive pill may interact with other medicines. These include:  the herbal medicine St John’s Wort some medicines used to treat epilepsy some medicines used to treat HIV some medicines used to treat tuberculosis (TB) medication such as omeprazole (an antacid) to make your stomach less acidic ellaOne cannot be used if you are already taking one of these medicines, as it may not be effective. Levonelle may still be used, but the dose may need to be increased – your doctor or pharmacist can advise on this. There should be no interaction between the emergency pill and most antibiotics. Two enzyme-inducing antibiotics (called rifampicin and rifabutin), used to treat or prevent meningitis or TB, may affect ellaOne while they’re being taken and for 28 days afterwards. If you want to check that your medicines are safe to take with the emergency contraceptive pill, ask your GP or a pharmacist. You should also read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicines.  Can I get the emergency contraceptive pill in advance? You may be able to get the emergency contraceptive pill in advance of having unprotected sex if: you are worried about your contraceptive method failing you are going on holiday you cannot get hold of emergency contraception easily Ask your GP or nurse for further information on getting advance emergency contraception. The IUD as emergency contraception An intrauterine device (IUD) How the IUD works How effective the IUD is at preventing pregnancy Who can use the IUD During pregnancy and breastfeeding Side effects of using the IUD  The IUD and other medicines How the IUD works The intrauterine device (IUD) is a small, T-shaped contraceptive device made from plastic and copper. It’s inserted into the uterus by a trained health professional. It may prevent an egg from implanting in your womb or being fertilised. If you’ve had unprotected sex, the IUD can be inserted up to five days afterwards, or up to five days after the earliest time you could have ovulated, to prevent pregnancy. It’s more effective at preventing pregnancy than the emergency pill, and it does not interact with any other medication. You can also choose to have the IUD left in as an ongoing method of contraception. How effective is the IUD at preventing pregnancy? There are several types of IUD. Newer ones have more copper and are more than 99% effective. Fewer than two women in 100 who use a newer IUD over five years will get pregnant. IUDs with less copper in them are less effective than this, but are still effective. The IUD is more effective than the emergency pill at preventing pregnancy after unprotected sex. Who can use the IUD? Most women can use an IUD, including women who have never been pregnant and those who are HIV positive. Your GP or clinician will ask about your medical history to check if an IUD is suitable for you. You should not use an IUD if you have: an untreated STI or a pelvic infection certain abnormalities of the womb or cervix any unexplained bleeding from your vagina – for example, between periods or after sex Women who have a heart condition should consult their GP or cardiologist before having an IUD fitted. Pregnancy and breastfeeding The IUD should not be inserted if there is a risk that you may already be pregnant. The IUD can be used safely if you’re breastfeeding, but the risk of complications during insertion is slightly higher. What are the side effects of the IUD Complications after having an IUD fitted are rare, but can include pain, infection, damage to the womb or expulsion (the IUD coming out of your womb). If you use the IUD as an ongoing method of regular contraception, it may make your periods longer, heavier or more painful. The IUD and other medicines The emergency IUD will not react with any other medication. Where can I get emergency contraception? You can get the emergency contraceptive pill and the IUD for free from: a GP surgery that provides contraception (some GP surgeries may not provide the IUD) a contraception clinic  a sexual health clinic (find sexual health services near you) some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics some young people''s clinics (call 0300 123 7123) You can also get the emergency contraceptive pill free from: most pharmacies (find pharmacies near you)  some NHS walk-in centres and minor injuries units some Accident & Emergency departments The doctor or nurse you see may ask for the following information: when you have had unprotected sex in your current menstrual cycle the date of the first day of your last period and the usual length of your cycle details of any contraceptive failure (such as how many pills you may have missed, and when) if you''ve used any medications that may affect your contraception You can buy the emergency contraceptive pill from most pharmacies if you''re aged 16 or over and from some organisations such as bpas or Marie Stopes. The cost varies, but it will be around £30 to £35. Contraception for the future If you''re not using a regular method of contraception, you might consider doing so in order to lower the risk of unintended pregnancy. Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) offers the most reliable protection against pregnancy, and you don''t have to think about it every day or each time you have sex. LARC methods are the: injection implant IUS IUD     Page last reviewed: 13/01/2015 Next review due: 13/01/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

This page runs through all the things you''ll need to do and the questions you should ask to make sure the surgeon is suitably qualified and experienced. You should: Talk to your GP Check the surgeon and hospital are registered  Visit cosmetic surgery clinics and hospitals  Talk with the surgeon Ask the surgeon about the procedure Look out for the new certification system  Talk to your GP When looking for a surgeon to carry out a cosmetic surgical procedure, your GP may be the best person to contact first.  It''s a good idea to talk to them about any health issues you have and whether these might affect or be affected by surgery. Your GP may also know who is an appropriately trained and experienced surgeon in the local area. Check the surgeon and hospital are registered The surgeon must, as a minimum, be registered with the GMC and be fully insured to carry out the procedure in the UK. The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) recommend choosing a surgeon who is on the GMC''s specialist register in the area of practice relevant to this procedure. Check that the person who advises you about the surgery is the surgeon who will actually perform or supervise the procedure. You should also check that the provider – the hospital, company or clinic – is registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which is the independent regulator of health services in England. You can ask the provider to show you their registration certificate, or you can look it up on the CQC database of registered providers. The CQC advises that you do not sign up for cosmetic surgery at a hospital or clinic that can''t provide evidence that it''s registered with them. Researching how good they are Once you''ve confirmed that the provider is registered with the CQC, research the quality of their service. You can do this by looking at the latest CQC inspection report, which appears when you search for the provider on the CQC website. Visit cosmetic surgery clinics Next, gather as much information as you can about the procedure, the places that offer it (clinics and hospitals), and the surgeons who carry it out.   Visit clinics and hospitals, and don''t be afraid to ask questions. Reputable services will be happy to discuss everything with you. Write down any questions you want to ask so you don''t forget them. The list could include the following questions: What level of care can I can expect after the operation? Who will look after me? What happens if something goes wrong? What if I''m not satisfied with the result? How much will it cost, including my aftercare? Will it cost extra to have further treatment if something goes wrong? Don''t choose a clinic or hospital far from where you live – you won''t want to travel far after an operation. Talk with the surgeon The clinic or hospital you choose should offer you a consultation appointment with the surgeon who will perform or supervise the procedure. Ask them if they are on the GMC''s specialist register in the area of practice relevant to the procedure you have chosen. Also, ask if they''re insured to perform cosmetic surgery in the UK. Talk to the surgeon about what you want to change and why, the options available, and the likely results of a surgical procedure. Tell the surgeon about any medical conditions you have and all the medications you''re taking. Consider getting a second opinion, if necessary. Ask the surgeon about the procedure The surgeon should give you details of exactly what''s involved in the procedure, including: how long it will take how it will be carried out the anaesthetic you''ll need what pain you can expect afterwards how long the recovery should be the potential risks and complications specific to the procedure how long the results will last Ask the surgeon about their personal complication rate and the most common complications for their patients for this procedure. The surgeon or clinic should not put pressure on you to have the surgery or to make a fast decision. It''s normal to have at least two weeks after the consultation to decide whether to go ahead with the procedure. Don''t be pressured by talk of special offers that are for a limited time only. If you feel any pressure at all from the clinic or surgeon, go somewhere else. Everyone considering cosmetic surgery should ask themselves these three questions:  Do I understand clearly what''s going to be done to me? Are my expectations of the results of the surgery realistic – not of perfection, but reasonable improvement? Do I understand what could go wrong and, if so, could I cope if it did go wrong? The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) website has some answers to common questions about surgery. Look out for the new certification system  At the moment, doctors who provide cosmetic surgery independently in the private sector only need to be registered with and licensed by the General Medical Council (GMC) as a doctor. There is no legal requirement for the doctor to be a specialist surgeon on the GMC''s specialist register. So to make cosmetic surgery as safe as possible, the Department of Health asked the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) to develop a certification system. This certification system, being introduced in 2016, would enable surgeons who perform cosmetic surgery to demonstrate that they have the appropriate skills and experience to perform cosmetic surgical procedures. Any surgeon who has been certified will have demonstrated that they have the appropriate training, skills and experience to perform the procedure. You''ll simply be able to visit the RCS website to look for a certified surgeon, for that extra peace of mind. Certification will be voluntary, but it is expected that all surgeons who want to carry out cosmetic surgery in the private sector will certify.

Known as gynaecomastia, this condition can result from a hormone imbalance or from being very overweight, which can increase levels of oestrogen and cause breast tissue to grow. Breast reduction surgery is an option for men with this condition. It may also be used to tighten the breast area after dramatic weight loss that has caused the skin to sag. However, it is not suitable for men whose large breasts are simply excess fat from being overweight. Normally, you''ll need to pay for breast reduction surgery privately. But the NHS may provide this for you if you''ve had gynecomastia for a long time, it has not responded to other treatments, and it''s causing you a lot of distress or pain. Read on to find out: How much does it cost to have privately?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems  More information  How much does it cost to have privately? In the UK, breast reduction surgery for men costs £3,500-£5,500, plus the cost of any consultations or follow-up care that may not be included in the price. Where do I go? If you''re looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for providers that can perform breast reductions for men.  All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC. The CQC publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. Also, research the surgeon who is going to carry out the operation. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor''s fitness to practise history.

What does it involve? Breast reduction surgery is usually carried out under general anaesthetic.  There are several techniques the surgeon could use, but generally the operation involves: making a cut (incision) around the nipple using liposuction to suck out excess fatty tissue extending the cuts and repositioning the nipples if there is a lot of tissue to remove The operation takes about 90 minutes. You usually need to stay in hospital overnight. Recovery It can take a few weeks to fully recover from breast reduction surgery. You may need to take a few days off work. It can take up to six months to see the full results. You will need to wear an elastic garment day and night for a few weeks after the operation. The length of time you need to keep the dressings on depends on how quickly your wounds heal. After one or two weeks, your stitches will either dissolve or be removed at an outpatient clinic. You should avoid stretching, strenuous exercise and heavy lifting for up to six weeks after the operation. You can drive again when it''s no longer painful to wear a seatbelt, which may be several weeks. Side effects to expect It''s typical after breast reduction surgery to have: sore breasts for a few weeks scars – these may take several months to fade Most men are just left with a scar around the nipple. But a large breast reduction operation may also result in a scar that runs down vertically and horizontally across the breast crease. What could go wrong Breast reduction surgery can occasionally result in problems, including: thick, obvious scarring unevenly shaped breasts or nipples wound healing problems  loss of nipple sensation bleeding inside the breast tissue (haematoma) – this generally occurs within the first 24 hours after the operation developing lumps, bruising or swelling Also, any type of operation carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic a blood clot forming in the deep veins The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. What to do if you have problems Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong, and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms, such as redness of your breast skin, a burning sensation or unusual swelling. If you have breast reduction surgery and are not happy with the results or think the procedure wasn''t carried out properly, you should take up the matter with your surgeon through the hospital or clinic where you were treated. If you have concerns about your care, you can contact the CQC. If you have any concerns about your surgeon, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC).

Some women consider having a labiaplasty because they don''t like the look of their labia, or because the labia cause discomfort. This is a major decision you should weigh up carefully. It''s natural and normal for a woman to have noticeable skin folds around her vaginal opening and, in most cases, this shouldn''t cause any problems.  A labiaplasty can be expensive and the operation carries a number of risks. There''s also no guarantee you''ll get the result you expected, and it won''t necessarily make you feel better about your body. If you’re thinking of going ahead, it’s a good idea to discuss your plans with your GP first. There might be a medical condition causing your labial discomfort, or a reason why the operation isn''t appropriate for you. If your GP feels that your labia are perfectly normal after examining them, they may want to have a chat with you about your reasons for wanting surgery. You may be advised to speak to a counsellor or psychologist before you commit to any surgery. You can also read "Is cosmetic surgery right for me?". Read on to find out the following: How much does a labiaplasty cost?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems   Who shouldn''t have it? How is it different to female genital mutilation? More information  How much does it cost? In the UK, a labiaplasty costs about £1,000-£3,000, plus the cost of any consultations or follow-up care that may not be included in the price. Occasionally, a labiaplasty may be carried out on the NHS if the vaginal lips are obviously abnormal and causing the woman distress or harming her health. However, the NHS doesn''t routinely provide this operation.  Where do I go? If you''re looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform a labiaplasty. All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC, which publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. You should also research the surgeon who is going to carry out the operation. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor’s fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many operations they''ve performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong the doctor''s patient satisfaction rates Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? A labiaplasty can be carried out using either a general anaesthetic or a local anaesthetic with sedation. The procedure involves shortening or reshaping the vaginal lips. The unwanted tissue is cut away with a scalpel or possibly a laser, and the loose edge may be stitched up with fine, dissolvable stitches. The whole procedure takes about one to two hours. Some patients are able to go home the same day. Recovery You may need to take some time off work to recover. It can take a couple of months for the skin to fully heal. During this time you need to: keep the area clean and free from infection wear loose underwear and clothes to prevent rubbing avoid sex for a few weeks use sanitary towels instead of tampons for a few weeks Your surgeon would give you more specific advice that you should also follow. Side effects to expect It’s typical after a labiaplasty to have soreness, bruising and swelling for up to two weeks. Peeing and sitting during this period would probably be uncomfortable, although you''d be given painkillers to help with this. What could go wrong A labiaplasty can occasionally result in: bleeding infection scarring of tissue reduced sensitivity of the genitals Any type of operation also carries a small risk of: developing a blood clot in a vein an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, patients find the desired effect wasn’t achieved and feel they need another operation. What to do if you have a problem Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. If you have a labiaplasty and you experience complications or are unhappy with the results, you should take up the matter with the surgeon who treated you. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the GMC. For more information, read the Royal College of Surgeon''s advice on What if things go wrong? Who shouldn''t have it? A labiaplasty should not be performed on girls younger than 18. Their labia may continue to grow and develop well beyond puberty, into early adulthood. How is it different to female genital mutilation? A labiaplasty is offered as cosmetic surgery or as treatment for a medical problem, with the full consent of the patient. Female genital mutilation (FGM) refers to procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is nearly always carried out on children without their consent, and in these cases is ethically and morally wrong. FGM is illegal in the UK.

It involves sucking out small areas of fat that are hard to lose through exercise and a healthy diet. It''s carried out on areas of the body where deposits of fat tend to collect, such as the buttocks, hips, thighs and tummy. The aim is to alter body shape, and the results are generally long-lasting, providing you maintain a healthy weight. It works best in people who are a normal weight and in areas where the skin is tight. Liposuction carried out for cosmetic reasons is not normally available on the NHS. However, liposuction can sometimes be used by the NHS to treat certain health conditions (read more about this in "More information"). If you''re thinking of having liposuction for cosmetic reasons, think very carefully before you go ahead. It can be expensive, the results can''t be guaranteed, and there are risks to consider. It’s a good idea to tell your GP first. Be sure that cosmetic surgery is right for you. Read on to find out: How much does it cost?

What does it involve?  Liposuction is usually carried out under general anaesthetic, although an epidural anaesthetic may be used for liposuction on lower parts of the body. The surgeon would mark on your body the area where fat is to be removed. He or she would then:  inject this area with a solution containing anaesthetic and medication, to reduce blood loss, bruising and swelling break up the fat cells using high-frequency vibrations, a weak laser pulse or a high-pressure water jet make a small incision (cut) and insert a suction tube attached to a vacuum machine (several cuts may need to be made if the area is large) move the suction tube back and forth to loosen the fat and suck it out drain any excess fluid and blood stitch up and bandage the treated area It usually takes one to three hours. Most people need to stay in hospital overnight. Afterwards After the procedure, you''d be fitted with an elasticated support corset or compression bandages. This helps to reduce swelling and bruising, and should be worn constantly for several weeks after the operation. You may need to take antibiotics straight after the procedure to reduce the risk of infection. Most people also take mild painkillers to ease any pain and swelling. Recovery  It usually takes about two weeks to make a full recovery. If you had a general anaesthetic, someone would need to drive you home and stay with you for the first 24 hours. You wouldn''t be able to drive for a few days. If a small area was treated, you may be able to return to work within a few days. If it was a large area, you may need up to 10 days off work to recover. The bandage or corset can be taken off while you shower. You''d need to avoid strenuous activity for up to four weeks (but walking and general movement should be fine). The results of the procedure aren''t always noticeable until the swelling has gone down. It can take up to six months for the area to settle completely. After about a week: Stitches would be removed (unless you had dissolvable stitches). At four to six weeks: You should be able to resume any contact sports or strenuous activities you''d normally do. Side effects to expect  It’s common after liposuction to have: bruising and swelling, which may last up to six months numbness, which should go away in six to eight weeks scars inflammation of the treated area, or the veins underneath fluid coming from the cuts swollen ankles (if the legs or ankles are treated) What could go wrong  Liposuction can occasionally result in: lumpy and uneven results bleeding under the skin (haematoma) persistent numbness that lasts for months changes in skin colour in the treated area a build-up of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) from the fluid injected into the body a blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism) damage to internal organs during the procedure Any type of operation also carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding developing a blood clot in a vein infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, people find the desired effect wasn’t achieved and feel they need another operation. What to do if you have problems   Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms. If you have liposuction and are not happy with the results, or you think the procedure wasn''t carried out properly, you should take up the matter with your surgeon through the hospital or clinic where you were treated. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the GMC. For more information, read the Royal College of Surgeon''s advice on What if things go wrong? Who shouldn''t have it Liposuction isn''t a treatment for obesity, and it won''t remove cellulite or stretch marks.

The aim of this cosmetic procedure is to improve the appearance of the facial skin – for example, by reducing age spots and evening out skin tone. There are three types of peel: superficial, medium and deep. See What it involves for more information. Superficial and medium peels are usually safe, provided they''re administered correctly. Deeper peels are more risky. Before you go ahead Chemical peels can be expensive and have their limitations. Cost: In the UK, chemical peels cost about £60-£100 for mild peels. Deeper peels may cost over £500. Limitations: The effects of a superficial or medium peel aren''t permanent. The effects of a deeper peel are long-lasting, but this is much more expensive, painful and risky. Safety: Take time to find a reputable practitioner who is properly qualified and practises in a clean, safe and appropriate environment. Ask the practitioner what you should do if something were to go wrong.  What it involves Superficial peels: skin cells removed from the top layer of skin (epidermis) left on the skin for a few minutes skin may feel tight for a couple of hours afterwards regular treatment needed to maintain the effects Medium peels: skin cells removed from the top and middle layers of skin left on the skin for a few minutes a burning or stinging sensation may be felt when the peel is applied skin may go brown or red in the days afterwards it can take up to six weeks for the skin to return to normal treatment is needed every 6 to 12 months to maintain the effects Deep peels: affect deeper layers of skin  a local anaesthetic and sedative may be needed a freezing sensation may be felt when the peel is applied can be left on the face for 30 minutes or more, depending on the desired effect your heart and blood pressure need to be monitored as phenol, the chemical used, can cause dangerous effects on the heart and kidneys expect some peeling, redness and discomfort for a few days swelling can last up to two weeks skin redness can last up to three months often results in lightening of the skin, so it''s not really suitable for darker skin it''s a one-off treatment with lasting effects, so doesn''t usually need to be repeated Risks Possible risks include: darkening or lightening of the skin – this can be permanent cold sores returning if you''ve had these before scarring or an infection – although this is rare As it heals, your skin would also be more sensitive to the sun, so you need to use sunscreen for at least a month after treatment. The practitioner carrying out the procedure should advise how you can reduce your risk of side effects and complications. What to do if you have problems If you''re not happy with the results or are experiencing problems, take up the matter with your practitioner through the clinic where you were treated. If there are any complications that require medical attention, it is best that you go back to the practitioner who treated you.

What does it involve? An otoplasty for an older child or adult can be done under local anaesthetic by either a plastic surgeon or an ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon. It generally involves: making one small cut (incision) behind the ear to expose the ear cartilage removing small pieces of cartilage if necessary  scoring and stitching the remaining structure into the desired shape and position Or, you may be offered a newer technique that involves scoring the cartilage through the ear skin using a needle. No incision is made, but there''s not much good evidence about the long-term quality or safety of this method.  Read the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on incisionless otoplasty. An otoplasty usually takes one to two hours. If local anaesthetic is used, you are able to go home the same day. Recovery During the first few days after surgery, your ears may be sore and tender or numb. You may have a slight tingling sensation for a few weeks. You may need to wear a bandage around your head for the first few days to protect your ears from infection. You won''t be able to wash your hair during this time. Some surgeons recommend wearing a head band at night for several weeks to protect the ears while you sleep. There may be some slight bruising, which can last about two weeks. You may want to delay returning to work or school until the bruising has disappeared.  Sometimes the stitches may come to the surface of the skin or cause the ear to feel tender. Pain and discomfort can be treated with over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. You need to avoid swimming and activities that put your ears at risk of injury – such as judo or rugby – for several weeks. Within 5 to 10 days: Stitches are removed (unless they were dissolvable stitches) and any bandage would probably come off. After a week or two: Most children would be able to return to school.  After eight weeks: Swimming should be OK. After 12 weeks: Contact sports should be OK. Side effects to expect After ear correction surgery, it''s common to have: a small scar behind each ear slight bruising around the ears soreness, numbness or tingling in the ears These symptoms should fade over time. What could go wrong Ear correction surgery can occasionally result in: inflammation of the ear cartilage a blood clot forming in the skin of the ear stiff ears – it can take several months for them to become flexible again the ears no longer being symmetrical the surgery not being successful and the ears starting to protrude again Any type of operation also carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding infection where the cut was made an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are and how they would be treated if they occurred.

(342, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/iud-coil.aspx', 'Coil', 'IUD coil - Contraception guide - NHS Choices', '', 'A woman can get pregnant if a man’s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping eggs being produced. One method of contraception is the intrauterine device, or IUD (sometimes called a coil). At a glance: facts about the IUD   How the IUD works   Who can use the IUD   Advantages and disadvantages of the IUD   Risks of the IUD   Where you can get an IUD An IUD is a small T-shaped plastic and copper device that’s inserted into your womb (uterus) by a specially trained doctor or nurse.  The IUD works by stopping the sperm and egg from surviving in the womb or fallopian tubes. It may also prevent a fertilised egg from implanting in the womb. The IUD is a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method. This means that once it''s in place, you don''t have to think about it each day or each time you have sex. There are several types and sizes of IUD. You can use an IUD whether or not you''ve had children.   At a glance: facts about the IUD There are different types of IUD, some with more copper than others. IUDs with more copper are more than 99% effective. This means that fewer than one in 100 women who use an IUD will get pregnant in one year. IUDs with less copper will be less effective.  An IUD works as soon as it''s put in, and lasts for five to 10 years, depending on the type. It can be put in at any time during your menstrual cycle, as long as you''re not pregnant. It can be removed at any time by a specially trained doctor or nurse and you''ll quickly return to normal levels of fertility. Changes to your periods (for example, being heavier, longer or more painful) are common in the first three to six months after an IUD is put in, but they''re likely to settle down after this. You might get spotting or bleeding between periods.  There''s a very small chance of infection within 20 days of the IUD being fitted.  There''s a risk that your body may expel the IUD. If you get pregnant, there''s an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy (when the egg implants outside the womb). But because you''re unlikely to get pregnant, the overall risk of ectopic pregnancy is lower than in women who don''t use contraception.  Having the IUD put in can be uncomfortable. Ask the doctor or nurse about pain relief. An IUD may not be suitable for you if you''ve had previous pelvic infections. The IUD does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the IUD, you''ll help to protect yourself against STIs. How the IUD works How it prevents pregnancy Having an IUD fitted How to tell whether an IUD is still in place Removing an IUD How it prevents pregnancy The IUD is similar to the IUS (intrauterine system) but works in a different way. Instead of releasing the hormone progestogen like the IUS, the IUD releases copper. Copper changes the make-up of the fluids in the womb and fallopian tubes, stopping sperm surviving there. IUDs may also stop fertilised eggs from implanting in the womb. There are types and sizes of IUD to suit different women. IUDs need to be fitted by a trained doctor or nurse at your GP surgery, local contraception clinic or sexual health clinic. An IUD can stay in the womb for five to 10 years, depending on the type. If you''re 40 or over when you have an IUD fitted, it can be left in until you reach the menopause or until you no longer need contraception. Having an IUD fitted An IUD can be fitted at any time during your menstrual cycle, as long as you are not pregnant. You''ll be protected against pregnancy straight away. Before you have an IUD fitted, you will have an internal examination to find out the size and position of your womb. This is to make sure that the IUD can be put in the correct place. You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people''s services Find a clinic near you You may also be tested for infections, such as STIs. It''s best to do this before an IUD is fitted so that you can have treatment (if you need it) before the IUD is put in. Sometimes, you may be given antibiotics at the same time as the IUD is fitted. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to insert an IUD. The vagina is held open, like it is during a cervical screening (smear) test, and the IUD is inserted through the cervix and into the womb. The fitting process can be uncomfortable and sometimes painful. You may get cramps afterwards. You can ask for a local anaesthetic or painkillers before having the IUD fitted. An anaesthetic injection itself can be painful, so many women have the procedure without. You may get pain and bleeding for a few days after having an IUD fitted. Discuss this with your GP or nurse beforehand.   The IUD needs to be checked by a doctor after three to six weeks. Speak to your doctor or nurse if you have any problems before or after this first check or if you want the IUD removed. Speak to your doctor or nurse if you or your partner are at risk of getting an STI. This is because STIs can lead to an infection in the pelvis. See your GP or go back to the clinic where your IUD was fitted as soon as you can if you: have pain in your lower abdomen have a high temperature have a smelly discharge These may mean you have an infection. How to tell whether an IUD is still in place An IUD has two thin threads that hang down a little way from your womb into the top of your vagina. The doctor or nurse who fits your IUD will teach you how to feel for these threads and check that it is still in place. Check your IUD is in place a few times in the first month, and then after each period or at regular intervals.  It''s very unlikely that your IUD will come out, but if you can''t feel the threads, or if you think the IUD has moved, you may not be fully protected against getting pregnant. See your doctor or nurse straight away and use an extra method of contraception, such as condoms, until your IUD has been checked. If you''ve had sex recently, you may need to use emergency contraception. Your partner shouldn''t be able to feel your IUD during sex. If he can feel the threads, get your doctor or nurse to check that your IUD is in place. They may be able to cut the threads to a shorter length. If you feel any pain during sex, go for a check-up. Removing an IUD An IUD can be removed at any time by a trained doctor or nurse. If you''re not going to have another IUD put in and you don''t want to get pregnant, use another method (such as condoms) for seven days before you have the IUD removed. This is to stop sperm getting into your body. Sperm can live for up to seven days in the body and could make you pregnant once the IUD is removed. As soon as an IUD is taken out, your normal fertility should return.  Who can use an IUD Most women can use an IUD. This includes women who have never been pregnant and those who are HIV positive. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your medical history to check if an IUD is the most suitable form of contraception for you. You should not use an IUD if you have: an untreated STI or a pelvic infection  problems with your womb or cervix  any unexplained bleeding from your vagina – for example, between periods or after sex Women who have had an ectopic pregnancy or recent abortion, or who have an artificial heart valve, must consult their GP or clinician before having an IUD fitted. You should not be fitted with an IUD if there''s a chance that you are already pregnant or if you or your partner are at risk of catching STIs. If you or your partner are unsure, go to your GP or a sexual health clinic to be tested. Using an IUD after giving birth An IUD can usually be fitted four to six weeks after giving birth (vaginal or caesarean). You''ll need to use alternative contraception from three weeks (21 days) after the birth until the IUD is fitted. In some cases, an IUD can be fitted within 48 hours of giving birth. An IUD is safe to use when you''re breastfeeding and it won''t affect your milk supply. Using an IUD after a miscarriage or abortion An IUD can be fitted straight away or within 48 hours after an abortion or miscarriage by an experienced doctor or nurse, as long as you were pregnant for less than 24 weeks. If you were pregnant for more than 24 weeks, you may have to wait a few weeks before having an IUD fitted.  Advantages and disadvantages of the IUD Although an IUD is an effective method of contraception, there are some things to consider before having one fitted. Advantages of the IUD Most women can use an IUD, including women who have never been pregnant. Once an IUD is fitted, it works straight away and lasts for up to 10 years or until it''s removed. It doesn''t interrupt sex. It can be used if you''re breastfeeding. Your normal fertility returns as soon as the IUD is taken out It''s not affected by other medicines. There''s no evidence that having an IUD fitted will increase the risk of cancer of the cervix, endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the womb) or ovarian cancer. Some women experience changes in mood and libido, but these changes are very small. There is no evidence that the IUD affects weight. Disadvantages of the IUD Your periods may become heavier, longer or more painful, though this may improve after a few months.  An IUD doesn''t protect against STIs, so you may have to use condoms as well. If you get an STI while you have an IUD, it could lead to a pelvic infection if not treated. The most common reasons that women stop using an IUD are vaginal bleeding and pain. Risks of the IUD Complications after having an IUD fitted are rare. Most will appear within the first year after fitting. Damage to the womb In fewer than one in 1,000 cases, an IUD can perforate (make a hole in) the womb or neck of the womb (cervix) when it''s put in. This can cause pain in the lower abdomen, but doesn''t usually cause any other symptoms. If the doctor or nurse fitting your IUD is experienced, the risk of this is very low. If perforation occurs, you may need surgery to remove the IUD. Contact your GP straight away if you feel a lot of pain after having an IUD fitted as perforations should be treated immediately. Pelvic infections Pelvic infections can occur in the first 20 days after the IUD is fitted. The risk of infection is very small. Fewer than one in 100 women who are at low risk of STIs will get a pelvic infection. Rejection Occasionally, the IUD is rejected (expelled) by the womb or can move (this is called displacement). This is more likely to happen soon after it has been fitted, although this is uncommon. Your doctor or nurse will teach you how to check that your IUD is in place. Ectopic pregnancy If the IUD fails and you become pregnant, your IUD should be removed as soon as possible if you''re going to continue with the pregnancy. There''s a small increased risk of ectopic pregnancy if a woman becomes pregnant while using an IUD. Where to get an IUD Most types of contraception are available free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries – talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics sexual health clinics – these offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people’s services (call the sexual health line on 0300 123 7123 for details) Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching your postcode or town. If you''re under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacists won''t tell your parents or carer, as long as they believe you fully understand the information you''re given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They''ll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won''t make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you''re at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.   Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 12/01/2015 Next review due: 12/01/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

(343, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/cosmetic-treatments-guide/Pages/nose-job.aspx', 'Nose job', 'Nose job', '', 'Nose reshaping (rhinoplasty, or a ''nose job'') is an operation to change the shape or size of the nose. It''s not usually available on the NHS if done for cosmetic reasons, but may be provided on the NHS if it''s needed to help you breathe. Nose reshaping surgery is a delicate, complex operation. The results can’t be guaranteed, there are risks to consider, and it can be expensive. Be sure about your reasons for having it before you go ahead. It''s a good idea to discuss your plans with your GP first. You can also read "Is cosmetic surgery right for me?" Read on to find out: How much does it cost?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems  More information  How much does it cost? The cost of nose reshaping in the UK ranges from £4,500 to £7,000. You should also factor in the cost of any consultations, further surgery or follow-up care that may be needed. Where do I go? If you''re looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform a rhinoplasty. All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC, which publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. You should also research the surgeon who is going to carry out the rhinoplasty. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor’s fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many operations they''ve performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong their own patient satisfaction rates Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? Nose reshaping is usually carried out under general anaesthetic. The surgeon may do any of the following: make the nose smaller (nose reduction), by removing some of the cartilage and bone make the nose larger (nose augmentation), by taking cartilage from the ears and bone from the hips, elbow or skull, and using this to build up the nose (known as a "graft") change the nose''s shape (including the nostrils), by breaking the nose bone and rearranging the cartilage change the angle between the nose and top lip The skin over the nose should just shrink or expand to its new shape. The operation involves either making one cut across the skin between the nostrils ("open rhinoplasty"), or tiny cuts inside the nostrils ("closed rhinoplasty").  A closed rhinoplasty leaves no visible scars and causes less swelling, but isn’t always possible or available. Either way, the procedure can take from an hour and a half to three hours. Most people would need to stay in hospital for one or two nights. You’d probably leave hospital with dressings ("packs") in each nostril, and a splint held over your nose with tape. You wouldn''t be able to breathe through your nose. Painkillers would be given to control any mild pain. Recovery You may need to take up to two weeks off work to recover. It might be several months before you see the full effect of the nose operation, and up to six months for all of the swelling to completely go. You wouldn''t be able to drive for a few days after the operation – your surgeon would advise about this. After about a week: Stitches would be removed (unless you had dissolvable stitches). The splint may be able to come off. At three weeks: Bruises, swelling and redness may have faded. You may be able to swim. At four to six weeks: You may be able to resume contact sports. You’d probably be advised to: prop your head up with pillows for a couple of days when resting, to reduce the swelling avoid hot baths and getting the splint wet avoid blowing your nose or removing any crusts until your appointment to have the splint removed  sneeze through your mouth, to avoid pressure on your nose avoid dusty or smoky places avoid strenuous exercise or contact sports for four to six weeks take paracetamol or another prescribed painkiller to relieve any mild pain Side effects to expect It’s common after nose reshaping to have: a blocked nose – you’d need to breathe through your mouth for a week or so stiffness and numbness of the nose soreness, swelling and bruising around the eyes, which can last three weeks light nosebleeds for the first few days What could go wrong Nose reshaping surgery can occasionally result in: permanent breathing difficulty damage to the cartilage wall between your nostrils an altered sense of smell heavy nosebleeds Any type of operation also carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding developing a blood clot in a vein infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, patients find the desired effect wasn’t achieved and feel they need another operation. What to do if you have problems  Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms. If you have a rhinoplasty and are not happy with the results, or you think the procedure wasn''t carried out properly, you should take up the matter with your surgeon through the hospital or clinic where you were treated. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC).

Inflammation is your immune system''s natural response to injury or infection. It causes swelling, and can help the body deal with invading germs. But in vasculitis, for some reason the immune system attacks healthy blood vessels, causing them to become swollen and narrow. This may be triggered by an infection or medication, although often the cause is unknown. Vasculitis can range from a minor problem that just affects the skin, to a more serious illness that causes problems with organs such as the heart or kidneys. There are many types of vasculitis. This page covers: Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome) Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener''s granulomatosis)  Henoch-Schönlein purpura  Kawasaki disease Microscopic polyangiitis Polyarteritis nodosa  Polymyalgia rheumatica  Takayasu arteritis  Other types of vasculitis  Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome) Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, also called Churg-Strauss syndrome, is a type of vasculitis that mainly affects adults aged 30 to 45. It can cause: asthma allergic rhinitis (cold-like symptoms caused by allergies) a high temperature (fever) muscle and joint pain tiredness loss of appetite and weight loss It can also affect the nerves, causing weakness, pins and needles or numbness, and it sometimes damages the kidneys or heart muscle. It''s usually treated with steroid medication. The Vasculitis UK website has more information about eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) Giant cell arteritis is a type of vasculitis that often affects the arteries in the head and neck. It mostly occurs in adults over the age of 50. It''s sometimes called temporal arteritis because the arteries around the temples are often affected. It can cause: aching and soreness around the temples jaw muscle pain while eating headaches double vision or vision loss It also commonly occurs alongside polymyalgia rheumatica (see below). The main treatment is steroid medication.  Read more about giant cell arteritis. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener''s granulomatosis)  Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, also called Wegener''s granulomatosis, is a type of vasculitis that mainly affects blood vessels in the nose, sinuses, ears, lungs and kidneys. It mainly affects middle-aged or elderly people. It can cause: a high temperature (fever) night sweats inflammation of the sinuses (sinusitis) nosebleeds and crusting of the nose shortness of breath and coughing up blood kidney problems It''s a serious condition that can be fatal if left untreated, as it can lead to organ failure. It''s usually treated with steroid medication or other medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system. Read more about granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Henoch-Schönlein purpura Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a rare type of vasculitis that usually occurs in children and can affect the skin, kidneys or bowel. It''s thought to be triggered by the body reacting to an infection. It can cause: a rash that looks like small bruises or reddish-purple spots joint pain tummy (abdominal) pain diarrhoea and vomiting blood in urine or poo It''s not usually serious and tends to get better without treatment. Read more about Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Kawasaki disease Kawasaki disease is a rare condition that can occur in children under five. The trigger is thought to be an infection, although the exact cause is not fully understood. It can cause: a high temperature (fever) that lasts for more than five days a rash swollen glands in the neck red fingers or toes, red eyes, and redness of the lips, tongue or mouth Kawasaki disease can affect the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart, so some children experience heart problems. It usually needs to be treated in hospital with aspirin and a treatment called immunoglobulin. Read more about Kawasaki disease. Microscopic polyangiitis Microscopic polyangiitis is a rare and potentially serious long-term type of vasculitis that most often develops in middle-aged people. It can affect any organ, but particularly affects the lungs, kidneys and nerves. It can cause: a rash shortness of breath and coughing up blood red and sore eyes pins and needles or numbness kidney problems It''s usually treated with steroid medication or other medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system. The Vasculitis UK website has more information about microscopic polyangiitis. Polyarteritis nodosa Polyarteritis nodosa is a rare type of vasculitis that particularly affects the arteries supplying the gut, kidneys and nerves. It tends to develop in childhood or in middle-aged people. It can sometimes be triggered by an infection, such as hepatitis B, but the exact cause is uncertain. It can cause: muscle and joint pain tummy (abdominal) pain, particularly after eating a rash pins and needles or numbness bleeding and ulcers in the gut It can be very serious if not treated. The main treatment is steroid medication, and sometimes other medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system. The Vasculitis UK website has more information about polyarteritis nodosa. Polymyalgia rheumatica  Polymyalgia rheumatica is a type of vasculitis that''s closely related to giant cell arteritis (see above). It mostly occurs in adults over 50 and is more common in women than men. It can cause: pain and stiffness in the shoulders, neck and hips, which is often worse after waking up a high temperature (fever) extreme tiredness loss of appetite and weight loss depression The main treatment is steroid medication, which is usually used in lower doses than for giant cell arteritis.  Read more about polymyalgia rheumatica. Takayasu arteritis Takayasu arteritis is a type of vasculitis that mainly affects young women. It''s very rare in the UK. It affects the main artery from the heart, as well as the major arteries branching off it. It can cause: extreme tiredness a high temperature (fever) weight loss muscle and joint pain dizziness shortness of breath painful, numb or cold limbs Treatment is usually with steroid medication. The Vasculitis UK website has more information about Takayasu arteritis. Other types of vasculitis  Other types of vasculitis include: Behçet''s disease – typically causes mouth ulcers and genital ulcers, and is more common in people from Greece, Turkey, the Middle East, China and Japan Buerger''s disease – affects blood vessels in the legs and arms, leading to reduced blood flow to the hands and feet; it''s closely linked to smoking Cogan''s syndrome – inflammation of the blood vessels in the inner ears and eyes cryoglobulin-associated vasculitis – associated with proteins in the blood called cryoglobulins and can occur after a hepatitis C infection; it causes a rash on the lower limbs, joint pain, nerve damage, tummy (abdominal) pain and kidney problems hypersensitivity vasculitis – usually caused by a reaction to a medication, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or certain antibiotics, and results in a temporary rash primary angiitis of the central nervous system – inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain rheumatoid vasculitis – vasculitis associated with rheumatoid arthritis Click on the links above for more information on these types of vasculitis.

(345, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/ius-intrauterine-system.aspx', 'Intrauterine system (IUS)', 'IUS (intrauterine system) or hormonal coil - Contraception guide - NHS Choices', '', 'A woman can get pregnant if a man’s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the IUS, or intrauterine system (sometimes called the hormonal coil). At a glance: facts about the IUS   How the IUS works   Who can use the IUS   Advantages and disadvantages of the IUS   Risks of the IUS   Where to get the IUS An IUS is a small, T-shaped plastic device that is inserted into your womb (uterus) by a specially trained doctor or nurse. The IUS releases a progestogen hormone into the womb. This thickens the mucus from your cervix, making it difficult for sperm to move through and reach an egg. It also thins the womb lining so that it''s less likely to accept a fertilised egg. It may also stop ovulation (the release of an egg) in some women. The IUS is a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method. It works for five years or three years, depending on the type, so you don''t have to think about contraception every day or each time you have sex. Two brands of IUS are used in the UK – Mirena and Jaydess.  You can use an IUS whether or not you''ve had children. At a glance: facts about the IUS   It''s more than 99% effective. Less than one in every 100 women who use Mirena will get pregnant in five years, and less than one in 100 who use Jaydess will get pregnant in three years. It can be taken out at any time by a specially trained doctor or nurse and your fertility quickly returns to normal. The IUS can make your periods lighter, shorter or stop altogether, so it may help women who have heavy periods or painful periods. Jaydess is less likely than Mirena to make your periods stop altogether. It can be used by women who can''t use combined contraception (such as the combined pill) – for example, those who have migraines. Once the IUS is in place, you don''t have to think about contraception every day or each time you have sex. Some women may experience mood swings, skin problems or breast tenderness.   There''s a small risk of getting an infection after it''s inserted. It can be uncomfortable when the IUS is put in, although painkillers can help with this. The IUS can be fitted at any time during your monthly menstrual cycle, as long as you''re definitely not pregnant. Ideally, it should be fitted within seven days of the start of your period, because this will protect against pregnancy straight away. You should use condoms for seven days if the IUS is fitted at any other time. The IUS does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the IUS, you''ll help to protect yourself against STIs.   How the IUS works How it prevents pregnancy  Having an IUS fitted How to tell whether an IUS is still in place Removing an IUS How it prevents pregnancy The IUS is similar to the IUD (intrauterine device), but works in a slightly different way. Rather than releasing copper like the IUD, the IUS releases a progestogen hormone, which is similar to the natural hormone progesterone that''s produced in a woman''s ovaries. Progestogen thickens the mucus from the cervix (opening of the womb), making it harder for sperm to move through it and reach an egg. It also causes the womb lining to become thinner and less likely to accept a fertilised egg. In some women, the IUS also stops the ovaries from releasing an egg (ovulation), but most women will continue to ovulate. If you''re 45 or older when you have the IUS fitted, it can be left until you reach menopause or you no longer need contraception. Having an IUS fitted You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people''s services Find a clinic near you An IUS can be fitted at any stage of your menstrual cycle, as long as you are not pregnant. If it''s fitted in the first seven days of your cycle, you will be protected against pregnancy straight away. If it''s fitted at any other time, you need to use another method of contraception (such as condoms) for seven days after it''s fitted. Before you have an IUS fitted, you will have an internal examination to determine the size and position of your womb. This is to make sure that the IUS can be positioned in the correct place. You may also be tested for any existing infections, such as STIs. It is best to do this before an IUS is fitted so that any infections can be treated. You may be given antibiotics at the same time as an IUS is fitted. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to insert an IUS: the vagina is held open, like it is during a cervical screening (smear) test the IUS is inserted through the cervix and into the womb The fitting process can be uncomfortable or painful for some women, and you may also experience cramps afterwards. You can ask for a local anaesthetic or painkillers before having the IUS fitted. Discuss this with your GP or nurse beforehand. An anaesthetic injection itself can be painful, so many women have the procedure without one. Once an IUS is fitted, it will need to be checked by a doctor after three to six weeks to make sure everything is fine. Speak to your GP or clinician if you have any problems after this initial check or if you want the IUS removed. Also speak to your GP if you or your partner are at risk of getting an STI, as this can lead to infection in the pelvis. See your GP or go back to the clinic if you: have pain in your lower abdomen have a high temperature have smelly discharge This may mean you have an infection. How to tell if an IUS is still in place An IUS has two thin threads that hang down a little way from your womb into the top of your vagina. The GP or clinician that fits your IUS will teach you how to feel for these threads and check that the IUS is still in place. Check your IUS is in place a few times in the first month and then after each period at regular intervals. It is highly unlikely that your IUS will come out, but if you can''t feel the threads or if you think the IUS has moved, you may not be fully protected against pregnancy. See your doctor or nurse straight away and use extra contraception, such as condoms, until your IUS has been checked. If you''ve had sex recently, you may need to use emergency contraception. Your partner shouldn''t be able to feel your IUS during sex. If he can feel the threads, get your GP or clinician to check that your IUS is in place. They may be able to cut the threads a little. If you feel any pain during sex, go for a check-up with your GP or clinician. Removing an IUS Your IUS can be removed at any time by a trained doctor or nurse. If you''re not going to have another IUS put in and you don''t want to become pregnant, use another contraceptive method (such as condoms) for seven days before you have the IUS removed. Sperm can live for seven days in the body and could fertilise an egg once the IUS is removed. As soon as an IUS is taken out, your normal fertility should return. Who can use an IUS Most women can use an IUS, including women who have never been pregnant and those who are HIV positive. Your GP or clinician will ask about your medical history to check if an IUS is the most suitable form of contraception for you. Your family and medical history will determine whether or not you can use an IUS. For example, this method of contraception may not be suitable for you if you have: breast cancer, or have had it in the past five years cervical cancer  liver disease unexplained vaginal bleeding between periods or after sex arterial disease or history of serious heart disease or stroke an untreated STI or pelvic infection problems with your womb or cervix An IUS may not be suitable for women who have untreated STIs. A doctor will usually give you a check-up to make sure you don''t have any existing infections. Using an IUS after giving birth An IUS can usually be fitted four to six weeks after giving birth (vaginal or caesarean). You''ll need to use alternative contraception from three weeks (21 days) after the birth until the IUS is put in. In some cases, an IUS can be fitted within 48 hours of giving birth. It is safe to use an IUS when you''re breastfeeding, and it won''t affect your milk supply. Using an IUS after a miscarriage or abortion An IUS can be fitted by an experienced doctor or nurse straight after an abortion or miscarriage, as long as you were pregnant for less than 24 weeks. If you were pregnant for more than 24 weeks, you may have to wait a few weeks before an IUS can be fitted. Advantages and disadvantages of the IUS Although an IUS is an effective method of contraception, there are several things to consider before having an IUS fitted. Advantages of the IUS It works for five years (Mirena) or three years (Jaydess).  It''s one of the most effective forms of contraception available in the UK. It doesn''t interrupt sex. An IUS may be useful if you have heavy or painful periods because your periods usually become much lighter and shorter, and sometimes less painful – they may stop completely after the first year of use. It can be used safely if you''re breastfeeding.  It''s not affected by other medicines. It may be a good option if you can''t take the hormone oestrogen, which is used in the combined contraceptive pill.  Your fertility will return to normal when the IUS is removed. There''s no evidence that an IUS will affect your weight or that having an IUS fitted will increase the risk of cervical cancer, cancer of the uterus or ovarian cancer. Some women experience changes in mood and libido, but these changes are very small. Disadvantages of the IUS Some women won''t be happy with the way that their periods may change. For example, periods may become lighter and more irregular or, in some cases, stop completely. Your periods are more likely to stop completely with Mirena than with Jaydess. Irregular bleeding and spotting are common in the first six months after having an IUS fitted. This is not harmful and usually decreases with time. Some women experience headaches, acne and breast tenderness after having the IUS fitted. An uncommon side effect of the IUS is the appearance of small fluid-filled cysts on the ovaries – these usually disappear without treatment. An IUS doesn''t protect you against STIs, so you may also have to use condoms when having sex. If you get an STI while you have an IUS fitted, it could lead to pelvic infection if it''s not treated. Most women who stop using an IUS do so because of vaginal bleeding and pain, although this is uncommon. Hormonal problems can also occur, but these are even less common. Risks of the IUS Complications caused by an IUS are rare and usually happen in the first six months after it has been fitted. These include: Damage to the womb In rare cases (fewer than one in 1,000 insertions) an IUS can perforate (make a hole in) the womb or neck of the womb (cervix) when it is put in. This can cause pain in the lower abdomen, but doesn''t usually cause any other symptoms. If the doctor or nurse fitting your IUS is experienced, the risk of perforation is extremely low. If perforation occurs, you may need surgery to remove the IUS. Contact your GP straight away if you feel a lot of pain after having an IUS fitted. Perforations should be treated immediately. Pelvic infections Pelvic infections may occur in the first 20 days after the IUS has been inserted. The risk of infection from an IUS is extremely small (fewer than one in 100 women who are at low risk of STIs will get an infection). A GP or clinician will usually recommend an internal examination before fitting an IUS to be sure that there are no existing infections. Rejection Occasionally, the IUS is rejected (expelled) by the womb or it can move (this is called displacement). This is not common and is more likely to happen soon after it has been fitted. Your doctor or nurse will teach you how to check that your IUS is in place. Ectopic pregnancy If the IUS fails and you become pregnant, your IUS should be removed as soon as possible if you are continuing with the pregnancy. There''s a small increased risk of ectopic pregnancy if a woman becomes pregnant while using an IUS. Where to get the IUS Most types of contraception are available for free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries – talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics sexual health clinics – they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people’s services (call 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find sexual health services near you, including contraception clinics. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you''re under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won''t tell your parents or carer as long as they believe you fully understand the information you''re given and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They''ll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won''t make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you''re at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.

(346, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/soothing-crying-baby.aspx', 'Babies, crying', 'Soothing a crying baby - Pregnancy and baby guide - NHS Choices', '', 'All babies cry, and some cry a lot. Crying is your baby''s way of telling you they need comfort and care. Sometimes it''s easy to work out what they want, and sometimes it isn''t. The most common reasons for crying are: hunger a dirty or wet nappy tiredness wanting a cuddle wind being too hot or too cold boredom overstimulation There may be times of the day when your baby tends to cry a lot and can''t be comforted. Early evening is the most common time for this to happen. This can be hard for you, as it''s often the time when you''re most tired and least able to cope. The amount babies cry tends to peak at about seven weeks, then gradually tail off. How to calm a crying baby Crying during feeds If your baby cries constantly Getting help with a crying baby Never shake your baby How to calm a crying baby Try some of the following ways to comfort your baby. Some may work better than others: If you''re breastfeeding, let your baby suckle at your breast. If you''re bottle feeding, give your baby a dummy. Sterilise dummies as you would bottles. To avoid tooth decay, don''t dip them in anything sweet. Some babies use their thumb instead. Some older babies like to use a bit of cloth or a blanket as a comforter. Hold your baby or put them in a sling so they''re close to you. Move about gently, sway and dance, talk to them and sing. Rock your baby backwards and forwards in the pram, or go out for a walk or a drive. Lots of babies like to sleep in cars. Even if they wake up again when you stop, at least you''ll have had a break. Find something for them to listen to or look at. This could be music on the radio, a CD, a rattle, or a mobile above the cot. Try stroking your baby''s back firmly and rhythmically, holding them against you or lying face downwards on your lap. Undress your baby and massage them gently and firmly. Avoid using any oils or lotions until your baby is at least a month old. Talk soothingly as you do it and keep the room warm enough. Some health centres and clinics run baby massage courses. For information, ask your midwife or health visitor. Try a warm bath. This calms some babies instantly, but makes others cry even more. Sometimes too much rocking and singing can keep your baby awake. You might find lying them down after a feed will help. Ask your health visitor for advice. Crying during feeds Some babies cry and seem unsettled around the time of a feed. If you''re breastfeeding, you may find that improving your baby''s positioning and attachment helps them settle. You can go to a breastfeeding drop-in and ask for help, or talk to your health visitor. It may be that something you''re eating or drinking is affecting your baby. If you think this is happening, try keeping a diary of what you eat and when the crying happens. If you see any patterns, talk to your health visitor. Crying during feeds can sometimes be a symptom of reflux, a common condition where babies bring back milk after feeds. Speak to your health visitor or GP for more information and advice. If your baby cries constantly There are several reasons that can cause a baby to cry excessively. It can be exhausting if you''ve tried everything and nothing seems to comfort your baby. Colic Excessive crying could be a sign that your baby has colic. Everyone agrees that colic exists, but nobody knows what causes it. Some doctors think it''s a kind of stomach cramp. The crying sounds miserable and distressed, and stops for a moment or two, then starts up again, which suggests it could be caused by waves of stomach pain. The crying can go on for some hours. There may be little you can do except try to comfort your baby and wait for the crying to pass. See some tips for coping with colic. Crying and illness If your baby is crying constantly and you can''t console or distract them, or the cry doesn''t sound like their normal cry, it can be a sign they are ill. Or they may be ill if they are crying and have other symptoms, such as a high temperature. If this is the case, contact your health visitor or GP. Get medical attention as soon as you can if your baby:   has much drier nappies than usual has a high temperature, but their hands and feet feel cold has a fit (seizure or convulsion) has blue, mottled, ashen (grey) or very pale skin breathes rapidly or makes a throaty noise while breathing, or seems to be working hard to breathe, perhaps sucking in their stomach under their ribcage has a spotty purple-red rash anywhere on the body – this could be a sign of meningitis See more signs of serious illness. If you think there''s something wrong, always follow your instincts. During the day, Monday to Friday, contact your GP surgery. At evenings and weekends you can call NHS 111 or your GP''s out-of-hours number. Getting help with a crying baby You can talk to a friend, your health visitor or GP, or contact the Cry-sis helpline on 08451 228 669, open 9am to 10pm, 7 days a week. You will be charged for your call.  Cry-sis can put you in touch with other parents who have been in the same situation. You can also visit the Cry-sis website for information on coping with crying babies.   If you decide to talk to your health visitor or GP, it can help to keep a record of how often and when your baby cries. For example, this might be after every feed or during the evening. This can help your health visitor or GP to work out if there is a particular cause for the crying. Keeping a record can also help you identify the times when you need extra support. You could think about possible changes to your routine. There may be times when you''re so tired and angry you feel like you can''t take any more. This happens to a lot of parents, so don''t be ashamed to ask for help. If you don''t have anyone who can take care of your baby for a short time and the crying is making you stressed, put your baby in their cot or pram, make sure they''re safe, close the door, go into another room and try to calm yourself down. Set a time limit – for example, 10 minutes – then go back. Never shake your baby No matter how frustrated you feel, you must never shake your baby. Shaking moves their head violently and can cause brain damage. Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video. How do I calm my crying baby?

(347, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/breastfeeding-first-days.aspx', 'Breastfeeding', 'Breastfeeding: the first few days - Pregnancy and baby guide - NHS Choices', '', 'In the first few days, you and your baby will be getting to know each other. It may take time for both of you to get the hang of breastfeeding. This happens more quickly for some women than others. But nearly all women produce enough milk for their baby. Preparing to breastfeed before the birth Skin-to-skin contact Colostrum: your first milk Your let-down reflex How often should I feed my baby? Building up your milk supply Dealing with leaking breasts Help and support for breastfeeding Preparing to breastfeed before the birth It''s good to find out as much as you can about breastfeeding before you have your baby. It will help you feel more confident when you start breastfeeding your baby. Antenatal classes usually cover the most important aspects of breastfeeding, such as positioning and attachment, expressing, common breastfeeding problems and how to tackle them. Find antenatal classes near you. You can find out about breastfeeding from your midwife, from family and friends, and useful helplines and websites. There are lots of groups and drop-ins, some specially designed for pregnant women who want to know more about breastfeeding. You can find out more by asking your midwife, health visitor, local peer supporter or GP. Or visit your local Children''s Centre. Skin-to-skin contact Having skin-to-skin contact with your baby straight after the birth will help to keep them warm and calm, and steady their breathing.  Skin to skin means holding your baby naked or dressed only in a nappy against your skin, usually under your top or under a blanket. Skin-to-skin time can be a bonding experience for you and your baby. It''s also a great time to have your first breastfeed. If you need any help, your midwife will support you with positioning and attachment. Skin-to-skin contact is good at any time. It will help to comfort you and your baby over the first few days and weeks as you get to know each other. It also helps your baby attach to your breast using their natural crawling and latching on reflexes. If skin-to-skin contact is delayed for some reason – for example, if your baby needs to spend some time in special care – it doesn''t mean you won''t be able to bond with or breastfeed your baby. If necessary, your midwife will show you how to express your breast milk until your baby is ready to breastfeed. They will also help you have skin-to-skin contact with your baby as soon as it''s possible. Skin-to-skin after a caesarean If your baby is born by caesarean, you should still be able to have skin-to-skin contact with your baby straight after the birth. Colostrum: your first milk The fluid your breasts produce in the first few days after birth is called colostrum. It''s usually a golden yellow colour. It''s a very concentrated food, so your baby will only need about a teaspoonful at each feed. Your baby may want to feed quite often, perhaps every hour to begin with. They''ll begin to have fewer, longer feeds once your breasts start to produce more "mature" milk after a few days. The more you breastfeed, the more your baby''s sucking will stimulate your supply and the more milk you''ll make. Your let-down reflex Your baby''s sucking causes milk stored in your breasts to be squeezed down ducts towards your nipples. This is called the let-down reflex. Some women get a tingling feeling, which can be quite strong. Others feel nothing at all. You''ll see your baby respond when your milk lets down. Their quick sucks will change to deep rhythmic swallows as the milk begins to flow. Babies often pause after the initial quick sucks while they wait for more milk to be delivered. Occasionally this let-down reflex can be so strong that your baby coughs and splutters. Your midwife, health visitor or breastfeeding supporter can help with this, or see some tips for when you have too much breast milk. If your baby seems to be falling asleep before the deep swallowing stage of feeds, they may not be properly attached to the breast. Ask your midwife, health visitor or breastfeeding supporter to check your baby''s positioning and attachment. Sometimes you''ll notice your milk letting down in response to your baby crying or when you have a warm bath or shower. This is normal. How often should I feed my baby? How often babies feed varies. As a very rough guide, your baby should feed at least eight times or more every 24 hours during the first few weeks. It''s fine to feed your baby whenever they are hungry, when your breasts feel full or if you just want to have a cuddle. It''s not possible to overfeed a breastfed baby. When your baby is hungry they may: get restless suck their fist or fingers make murmuring sounds turn their head and open their mouth (rooting) It''s best to try and feed your baby during these early feeding cues as a crying baby is difficult to feed. Building up your milk supply Around two to four days after birth you may notice that your breasts become fuller and warmer. This is often referred to as your milk "coming in". Your milk will vary according to your baby''s needs. Each time your baby feeds, your body knows to make more milk for the next feed. The amount of milk you make will increase or decrease depending on how often your baby feeds. In the early weeks, "topping up" with formula milk or giving your baby a dummy can lower your milk supply. Feed your baby as often as they want and for as long as they want. This is called responsive feeding. In other words, responding to your baby''s needs. It''s also known as on-demand or baby-led feeding. In the beginning, it can feel like you''re doing nothing but feeding. But gradually you and your baby will get into a pattern, and the amount of milk you produce will settle down. It''s important to breastfeed at night because this is when you produce more hormones (prolactin) to build up your milk supply. See how to tell if your baby is getting enough milk. Dealing with leaking breasts Sometimes, breast milk may leak unexpectedly from your nipples. Press the heel of your hand gently but firmly on your breast when this happens. Wearing breast pads will stop your clothes becoming wet with breast milk. Remember to change them frequently to prevent any infection. Expressing some milk may also help. Only express enough to feel comfortable as you don''t want to overstimulate your supply. If your baby hasn''t fed recently you could offer them a feed as breastfeeding is also about you being comfortable. Help and support for breastfeeding For more information on how to get comfortable and make sure your baby is properly attached, see Positioning and attachment. If you are having difficulties with breastfeeding, take a look at Breastfeeding problems. Ask your midwife or health visitor for help. They can also tell you about other breastfeeding support available near you. Search online for breastfeeding support in your area.

(349, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/male-condoms.aspx', 'Condoms (male and female)', 'Male condoms - Contraception guide - NHS Choices', '', 'A woman can get pregnant if a man’s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the condom. At a glance: condoms   How a condom works   Who can use condoms   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks of condoms    Where to get condoms There are two types of condoms: male condoms, which are worn on the penis, and female condoms, which are worn inside the vagina. This page is about male condoms, where you can get them and how they work. Male condoms are made from very thin latex (rubber), polyisoprene or polyurethane, and are designed to stop a man''s semen from coming into contact with his sexual partner. When condoms are used correctly during vaginal sex, they help to protect against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). When used correctly during anal and oral sex, they help to protect against STIs. Condoms are the only contraception that protect against pregnancy and STIs. At a glance: condoms If used correctly every time you have sex, male condoms are 98% effective. This means that two out of 100 women using male condoms as contraception will become pregnant in one year. You can get free condoms from contraception clinics, sexual health clinics and some GP surgeries. Oil-based products, such as moisturiser, lotion and Vaseline, can make latex and polyisoprene condoms less effective, but they are safe to use with condoms made from polyurethane. Water-based lubricant, available in pharmacies and sexual health clinics, is safe to use with all condoms. It''s possible for a condom to slip off during sex. If this happens, you may need emergency contraception, and to get checked for STIs. Condoms need to be stored in places that aren''t too hot or cold, and away from sharp or rough surfaces that could tear them or wear them away. Putting on a condom can be an enjoyable part of sex, and doesn''t have to feel like an interruption. If you''re sensitive to latex, you can use polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms instead.  A condom must not be used more than once. Use a new one each time you have sex. Condoms have a use-by date on the packaging. Don''t use out-of-date condoms. Always buy condoms that have the BSI kite mark and the CE mark on the packet. This means that they''ve been tested to high safety standards. Condoms that don''t have the BSI kite mark and CE mark won''t meet these standards, so don''t use them. How a condom works Condoms are a barrier method of contraception. They stop sperm from reaching an egg by creating a physical barrier between them. Condoms can also protect against STIs if used correctly during vaginal, anal and oral sex. It''s important that the man''s penis does not make contact with the woman''s vagina before a condom has been put on. This is because semen can come out of the penis before a man has fully ejaculated (come). If this happens, or if semen leaks into the vagina while using a condom, seek advice about emergency contraception from your GP or contraception clinic. You should also consider having an STI test. How to use a condom  Take the condom out of the packet, taking care not to tear it with jewellery or fingernails – do not open the packet with your teeth. Place the condom over the tip of the erect penis. If there''s a teat on the end of the condom, use your thumb and forefinger to squeeze the air out of it. Gently roll the condom down to the base of the penis. If the condom won''t roll down, you''re probably holding it the wrong way round – if this happens, throw the condom away because it may have sperm on it, and try again with a new one. After sex, withdraw the penis while it''s still erect – hold the condom onto the base of the penis while you do this.  Remove the condom from the penis, being careful not to spill any semen. Throw the condom away in a bin, not down the toilet. Make sure the man''s penis does not touch his partner''s genital area again. If you have sex again, use a new condom. Condoms with spermicide Some male condoms come with spermicide on them. Spermicide is a chemical that kills sperm. These condoms are slowly being phased out, as research has found that a spermicide called nonoxynol 9 does not protect against STIs such as chlamydia and HIV, and may even increase the risk of infection. It is best to avoid using spermicide-lubricated condoms, or spermicide as an additional lubricant. Who can use condoms Most people can safely use condoms. There are many different varieties and brands of male condom, and it''s up to you and your partner which type of condom you use. However, condoms may not be the most suitable method of contraception for everyone. Some men and women are sensitive to the chemicals in latex condoms. If this is a problem, polyurethane or polyisoprene condoms have a lower risk of causing an allergic reaction. Men who have difficulty keeping an erection may not be able to use male condoms, as the penis must be erect to prevent semen leaking from the condom, or the condom slipping off.  Advantages and disadvantages of condoms It is important to consider which form of contraception is right for you and your partner. Take care to use condoms correctly, and consider using other forms of contraception for extra protection. Advantages When used correctly and consistently, condoms are a reliable method of preventing pregnancy.  They help to protect both partners from STIs, including chlamydia, gonorrhoea and HIV. You only need to use them when you have sex – they do not need advance preparation and are suitable for unplanned sex. In most cases, there are no medical side effects from using condoms. Male condoms are easy to get hold of and come in a variety of shapes, sizes and flavours. Disadvantages Some couples find that using condoms interrupts sex – to get around this, try to make using a condom part of foreplay.  Condoms are very strong, but may split or tear if not used properly. Some people may be allergic to latex, plastic or spermicides – you can get condoms that are less likely to cause an allergic reaction. When using a male condom, the man has to pull out after he has ejaculated and before the penis goes soft, holding the condom firmly in place. If male condoms aren''t used properly, they can slip off or split. If this happens, practise putting them on so that you get used to using them properly.   Can anything make condoms less effective? Sperm can sometimes get into the vagina during sex, even when using a condom. This may happen if: the penis touches the area around the vagina before a condom is put on the condom splits or comes off the condom gets damaged by sharp fingernails or jewellery you use oil-based lubricants, such as lotion, baby oil or petroleum jelly, with latex or polyisoprene condoms – this damages the condom  you are using medication for conditions like thrush, such as creams, pessaries or suppositories – this can damage latex and polyisoprene condoms and stop them working properly If you think that sperm has entered the vagina, talk to your GP or staff at a contraception clinic about emergency contraception and the risk of STIs. As well as condoms, you can use other forms of contraception, such as the contraceptive pill, for extra protection against pregnancy. However, other forms of contraception will not protect you against STIs. You will still be at risk of STIs if the condom breaks. Using lubricant Condoms come ready lubricated to make them easier to use, but you may also like to use additional lubricant, or lube. This is particularly advised for anal sex, to reduce the chance of the condom splitting. Any kind of lubricant can be used with condoms that are not made of latex. However, if you are using latex or polyisoprene condoms, do not use oil-based lubricants, such as: body oil or lotion petroleum jelly or creams (such as Vaseline) This is because they can damage the condom and make it more likely to split. If a condom splits or comes off If the condom splits or comes off, you can use emergency contraception to help prevent pregnancy. This is for emergencies only and shouldn''t be used as a regular form of contraception. Depending on the type of pill, you need to take the emergency contraceptive pill up to 72 hours or up to 120 hours (five days) after unprotected sex. The intrauterine device (IUD) can be used as emergency contraception up to five days after sex. If you have been at risk of pregnancy, you have also been at risk of STIs. You should have a check-up at: a GP surgery a contraception clinic a sexual health clinic or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic a young person''s clinic Risks For most people, there are no serious risks associated with using condoms, although some people are allergic to latex condoms. You can get condoms that are less likely to cause an allergic reaction. Where to get condoms Everyone can get condoms for free, even if they are under 16. They are available from: contraception clinics sexual health or GUM (genitourinary medicine) clinics some GP surgeries  some young people''s services Find sexual health services near you You can also buy condoms from: pharmacies supermarkets websites mail-order catalogues vending machines in some public toilets some petrol stations If you buy condoms online, make sure that you buy them from a pharmacist or other legitimate retailer. Always choose condoms that carry the BSI kite mark and the European CE mark as a sign of quality assurance. This means they have been tested to the required safety standards. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you''re under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won''t tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you''re given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with young people under 16. They''ll encourage you to consider telling your parents but they won''t make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you''re at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.

Bile ducts are small tubes that connect the liver and small intestine. They allow fluid called bile to flow from the liver, through the pancreas, to the gut, where it helps with digestion. Cancer can affect any part of these ducts. Bile duct cancer can sometimes be cured if caught very early on, but it''s not usually picked up until a later stage, when a cure isn''t possible. This page covers: Symptoms Causes Tests Treatments Outlook Symptoms of bile duct cancer There aren''t usually any symptoms of bile duct cancer until it grows large enough to block the bile ducts. This can cause: yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) itchy skin pale stools and dark urine loss of appetite and weight loss  persistent tiredness and feeling unwell tummy (abdominal) pain and swelling – some people feel a dull ache in the upper right hand side of their tummy high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above chills and shivering See your GP if you have persistent symptoms that you''re worried about – particularly if you have jaundice. These symptoms can have a number of causes, so it''s important to get a proper diagnosis. Causes of bile duct cancer The exact cause of bile duct cancer is unknown. Most occur without a clear cause, although some things can increase your risk of getting it. These include: primary sclerosing cholangitis – a rare type of liver disease that causes long-term inflammation of the liver bile duct abnormalities – such as cysts (fluid-filled sacs) in the bile ducts that are present from birth biliary stones within the liver – hard stones, similar to gallstones, that form in the bile duct infection with a liver fluke parasite (mostly a problem in Asia) exposure to certain chemicals and toxins, including thorotrast (a special dye that used to be used in medical scans) There may also be a link with long-term hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections, liver scarring (cirrhosis), diabetes, obesity, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Tests for bile duct cancer Several tests may be needed to help diagnose bile duct cancer. These will usually be carried out in hospital. Tests you may have include:  blood tests to check for signs of cancer or a problem with your liver scans, such as an ultrasound scan, computerised tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan detailed X-rays taken after a special dye has been injected into your bile ducts to make them show up more clearly a biopsy – where a small sample of tissue is removed so it can be looked at under a microscope for signs of cancer Read more about how bile duct cancer is diagnosed. Treatments for bile duct cancer It''s not usually possible to cure bile duct cancer because it''s often only diagnosed after it has grown and spread. But even in these cases, treatment can help control the symptoms for months or possibly years. The main treatments for bile duct cancer are: surgery to remove the affected area – this is only suitable for a small number of people, but could get rid of the cancer completely inserting a hollow tube (stent) into the bile duct to stop it becoming blocked – this can help relieve symptoms such as jaundice chemotherapy – where medication is given to stop the cancer cells growing and to relieve your symptoms radiotherapy – where a beam of radiation is carefully aimed at the cancer cells to stop them growing and to relieve your symptoms Read more about how bile duct cancer is treated.   Outlook for bile duct cancer The outlook for bile duct cancer depends on which part of the bile duct is affected and how far the cancer has grown. Even if it''s possible to remove the cancer, there''s a chance it could come back later.  Overall: one in every two to five people (20-50%) will live at least five years if bile duct cancer is caught early on and surgery is carried out to try to remove it one in every 50 people (2%) will live at least five years if it''s caught at a later stage and surgery to remove it isn''t possible Cancer Research UK has more information about survival statistics for bile duct cancer. Bile duct cancer support group The Alan Morement Memorial Fund (AMMF) is the main UK charity that provides support for people affected by bile duct cancer.

What does it involve? There are two types of tummy tuck, and both are usually carried out under a general anaesthetic. A partial tummy tuck involves: making a large incision (cut) across the lower tummy separating the skin from the abdominal wall below the tummy button removing excess fat cutting away excess skin pulling together the remaining skin and stitching it in place A full tummy tuck involves: making a large incision across the lower tummy, from hip to hip, just above the pubic area making a second incision to free the belly button from the tissue that surrounds it separating the skin from the abdominal wall realigning the abdominal muscles removing excess fat and skin cutting a new hole for the belly button, and stitching this back in place pulling together the remaining skin and stitching it in place The operation can take between two and five hours. Most people need to stay in hospital for a few nights. A tummy tuck may be quite painful, although pain relief would be provided. You would leave hospital with dressings and a pressure garment (corset) on your tummy, or tummy control pants. Someone would need to drive you home and stay with you for the following 24 hours. Recovery You would need to take about four to six weeks off work and exercise. You wouldn''t be able to drive for a few weeks after the operation (your surgeon and insurance company would advise about this). It takes about six weeks to fully recover, and it may be several weeks before you see the full effects of the tummy tuck. You’d need to wear a special type of corset or tummy control pants to encourage your skin to heal properly and reduce any swelling. Generally, you''d need to take it easy for a few weeks and keep your knees bent while in bed, to avoid putting strain on your stitches. After a week or two: A wound check would be carried out At six weeks: Your corset should be able to come off and you''d usually be able to return to most of your normal activities. Side effects to expect You would be left with a scar running across your lower tummy and, if you had a full abdominoplasty, a scar around your belly button. It’s also common after a tummy tuck to: find it difficult to stand up straight – it will feel like your tummy is being pulled (this will improve over time) have pain and bruises feel numbness in your tummy for a few months to years  have a temporary fluid-filled swelling above the scar have red, raised scars in the first six weeks – which eventually fade to white What could go wrong A tummy tuck can occasionally result in: thick, obvious scars developing bulges under the skin ''dog ears'' (extra skin) at the edges of the scar wounds failing to heal a collection of fluid in the area that was operated on a collection of blood underneath the skin (haematoma) numbness or pain in the tummy or down the leg tummy cramps or pain breathing problems Any type of operation also carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding developing a blood clot in a vein infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic (very rare) The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, people find the desired effect wasn’t achieved and feel they need another operation. What to do if you have problems  Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms. If you have a tummy tuck and are not happy with the results, or you think the procedure wasn''t carried out properly, you should take up the matter with the surgeon who treated you. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC).

Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the progestogen-only pill (POP). At a glance: the progestogen-only pill   How it works   Who can use it What to do if you miss a pill   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks It contains the hormone progestogen, but doesn''t contain oestrogen. You need to take the progestogen-only pill at or around the same time every day. The progestogen-only pill thickens the mucus in the cervix, which stops sperm reaching an egg. In can also stop ovulation, depending on the type of progestogen-only pill you take.  Newer progestogen-only pills contain desogestrel. At a glance: facts about the progestogen-only pill If taken correctly, it can be more than 99% effective. This means that fewer than 1 woman in 100 who uses the progestogen-only pill as contraception will get pregnant in one year. You take a pill every day, with no break between packs of pills. The progestogen-only pill can be used by women who can''t use contraception that contains oestrogen – for example, because they have high blood pressure, previous blood clots or are overweight.  You can take the progestogen-only pill if you''re over 35 and you smoke. You must take the progestogen-only pill at the same time each day. If you take it more than three hours late – or 12 hours late if you take a desogestrel pill, such as Cerazette – it may not be effective.  If you''re sick (vomit) or have severe diarrhoea, the progestogen-only pill may not work.  Some medicines may affect the progestogen-only pill''s effectiveness – ask your doctor for details.  Your periods may stop or become lighter, irregular or more frequent.  Side effects may include spotty skin and breast tenderness – these should clear up within a few months.  The progestogen-only pill doesn''t protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the progestogen-only pill, you''ll help protect yourself against STIs. How the progestogen-only pill works How it prevents pregnancy Using the progestogen-only pill Starting the first pack of pills How it prevents pregnancy The progestogen-only pill works by thickening the mucus in the neck of the womb, so it''s harder for sperm to penetrate into the womb and reach an egg. Sometimes, depending on the type of progestogen-only pill, it may also prevent ovulation, where an egg is released from your ovaries each month. The desogestrel pill (a 12-hour pill, such as Cerazette) stops ovulation in 97% of menstrual cycles. This means that if you''re using a 12-hour progestogen-only pill, you won''t release an egg in 97 cycles out of 100. Using the progestogen-only pill There are two different types of progestogen-only pill: three-hour progestogen-only pill – must be taken within three hours of the same time each day; examples are Femulen, Micronor, Norgeston and Noriday 12-hour progestogen-only pill (desogestrel pill, such as Cerazette) – must be taken within 12 hours of the same time each day It''s important to follow the instructions that come with your pill packet – missing pills or taking the pill alongside other medicines can reduce its effectiveness. There are 28 pills in a pack of progestogen-only pills. You need to take one pill every day within either three or 12 hours of the same time each day, depending on which type you are taking. There''s no break between packs of pills – when you finish one pack, you start the next one the next day. Starting the first pack of pills Choose a convenient time in the day to take your first pill. Continue to take a pill at the same time each day until the pack is finished.  Start your next pack of pills the following day. There is no break between packs of pills. You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people''s services Find a clinic near you You can start the progestogen-only pill at any time in your menstrual cycle. If you start it on day one of your menstrual cycle (the first day of your period), it will work straight away and you will be protected against pregnancy. You won''t need additional contraception. If you start the progestogen-only pill on day five of your menstrual cycle or earlier (the fifth day after the start of your period or before), you will be protected from pregnancy straight away unless you have a short menstrual cycle (your period is every 23 days or less). If you have a short menstrual cycle, you will need additional contraception, such as condoms, until you have taken the pill for two days. If you start the progestogen-only pill on any other day of your cycle, you will not be protected from pregnancy straight away and will need additional contraception until you have taken the pill for two days. After having a baby If you have just had a baby, you can start the progestogen-only pill on day 21 after the birth. You will be protected against pregnancy straight away. If you start the progestogen-only pill more than 21 days after giving birth, you will need additional contraception such as condoms until you have taken the pill for two days. After a miscarriage or abortion If you have had a miscarriage or abortion, you can start the progestogen-only pill up to five days afterwards and will be protected from pregnancy straight away. If you start the pill more than five days after a miscarriage or abortion, use additional contraception until you have taken the pill for two days. What to do if you miss a pill If you forget to take a progestogen-only pill, what you should do depends on:  the type of pill you are taking  how long ago you missed the pill and how many pills you have forgotten to take whether you have had sex without using another form of contraception in the previous seven days If you are less than three or less than 12 hours late taking the pill If you are taking a three-hour progestogen-only pill and are less than three hours late taking it, or if you are taking the 12-hour progestogen-only pill and are less than 12 hours late: take the late pill as soon as you remember, and  take the remaining pills as normal, even if that means taking two pills on the same day The pill will still work, and you''ll be protected against pregnancy – you do not need to use additional contraception. Don''t worry if you have had sex without using another form of contraception. You do not need emergency contraception. If you are more than three or more than 12 hours late taking the pill If you are taking a three-hour progestogen-only pill and are more than three hours late taking it, or are taking the 12-hour progestogen-only pill and are more than 12 hours late, you will not be protected against pregnancy. What you should do: take a pill as soon as you remember – only take one, even if you''ve missed more than one pill take the next pill at the usual time – this may mean taking two pills on the same day (one when you remember and one at the usual time); this is not harmful carry on taking your remaining pills each day at the usual time use extra contraception such as condoms for the next two days (48 hours) after you remember to take your missed pill, or don''t have sex if you have unprotected sex during the two days after you miss your pill, you may need emergency contraception – get advice from your contraception clinic or GP It takes two days for the progestogen-only pill to thicken cervical mucus so sperm cannot get through or survive. The Faculty of Sexual Health and Reproductive Healthcare advises using extra contraception for two days after you remember to take your pill. The patient information leaflet that comes with your pill might say to use condoms for the next seven days after you remember to take your pill. This is because it takes seven days for the pill to suppress ovulation. Emergency contraception If you have recently had unprotected sex, you may need emergency contraception. Seek advice from your GP or local sexual health clinic straight away. You can also call NHS 111 or the Sexual Health Line on 0300 123 7123. Vomiting and diarrhoea If you vomit within two hours of taking a progestogen-only pill, it may not have been fully absorbed into your bloodstream. Take another pill straight away and the next pill at your usual time. If you don''t take the replacement within three hours (or 12 hours for the 12-hour pill) of your normal time, use additional contraception, such as condoms, for two days (seven days for the 12-hour pill). If you continue to be sick, keep using another form of contraception while you''re ill and for two days after recovering. Very severe diarrhoea – six to eight watery stools in 24 hours – may also mean that the pill doesn''t work properly. Keep taking your pill as normal, but use additional contraception, such as condoms, while you have diarrhoea and for two days after recovering, or seven days if you''re taking a 12-hour pill. Speak to your GP or contraception nurse or call NHS 111 or the Sexual Health Line on 0300 123 7123 if you''re unsure whether you''re protected against pregnancy, or if your sickness or diarrhoea continues. Who can use the progestogen-only pill? Most women can use the progestogen-only pill. You may not be able to use it if you''ve had: heart disease  liver disease  breast cancer  cysts on your ovaries unexplained vaginal bleeding If you''re healthy and there are no medical reasons why you should not take the progestogen-only pill, you can take it until your menopause or until you are 55. Breastfeeding The progestogen-only pill is safe to use if you are breastfeeding. Small amounts of progestogen may pass into your breast milk, but this is not harmful to your baby. The progestogen-only pill does not affect the way your breast milk is produced. Pregnancy Although it''s very unlikely, there is a very small chance that you could become pregnant while taking the progestogen-only pill. If this happens, there is no evidence that the pill will harm your unborn baby. If you think you may be pregnant, speak to your GP or visit your local contraception clinic. Get medical advice if you have a sudden or unusual pain in your tummy (abdomen), or if your period is much shorter or lighter than usual. It''s possible that these are warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy, although this is rare. Advantages and disadvantages Some advantages of the progestogen-only pill include: it does not interrupt sex  you can use it when breastfeeding  it''s useful if you cannot take the hormone oestrogen, which is in the combined pill, contraceptive patch and vaginal ring you can use it at any age – even if you smoke and are over 35 it can reduce the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and painful periods Some disadvantages of the progestogen-only pill include: you may not have regular periods while taking it – your periods may be lighter, more frequent, or may stop altogether, and you may get spotting between periods it does not protect you against STIs you need to remember to take it at or around the same time every day  some medications, including certain types of antibiotic, can make it less effective The progestogen-only pill is generally well tolerated and side effects are rare. Some side effects can include:  acne  breast tenderness and breast enlargement  an increased or decreased sex drive  mood changes  headache and migraine nausea or vomiting  small fluid-filled sacs called cysts on your ovaries – these are usually harmless and disappear without treatment stomach upset  weight gain These side effects are most likely to occur during the first few months of taking the progestogen-only pill, but they generally improve over time and should stop within a few months. If you have any concerns about your contraceptive pill, see your GP or practice nurse. They may advise you to change to another pill or a different form of contraception. The progestogen-only pill with other medicines When you take two or more medicines at the same time, the effects of one medicine can be changed by the other. This is known as an interaction. Some medicines interact with the progestogen-only pill and it doesn''t work properly. Some interactions are listed on this page, but it is not a complete list. If you want to check whether your medicines are safe to take with the progestogen-only pill, you can:  ask your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine Antibiotics The antibiotics rifampicin and rifabutin, which can be used to treat illnesses including tuberculosis and meningitis, can reduce the effectiveness of the progestogen-only pill. Other antibiotics do not have this effect. If you are prescribed rifampicin or rifabutin, you may need additional contraception such as condoms while taking the antibiotic and for 28 days after. Speak to your doctor or nurse for advice. Epilepsy and HIV medicines, and St John''s wort The progestogen-only pill can interact with medicines called enzyme inducers. These speed up the breakdown of progestogen by your liver, reducing the effectiveness of the progestogen-only pill. Examples of enzyme inducers are: the epilepsy drugs carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone and topiramate  St John''s wort, a herbal remedy some antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV – research suggests interactions between these medicines and the progestogen-only pill can affect the safety and effectiveness of both Your GP or nurse may advise you to use an alternative or additional form of contraception while taking any of these medicines. Risks of taking the progestogen-only pill The progestogen-only pill is very safe to take. However, as with the combined contraceptive pill, there are certain risks. These risks are small. For most women, benefits of the progestogen-only pill outweigh the risks. Ovarian cysts Some women can develop fluid-filled cysts on their ovaries. These are not dangerous and don''t usually need to be removed. The cysts usually disappear without treatment. In many cases, the cysts do not cause symptoms, although some women experience pelvic pain. Breast cancer Research is continuing into the link between breast cancer and the progestogen-only pill. Research suggests women who use any type of hormonal contraception have a slightly higher chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer compared with people who don''t use hormonal contraception. However, 10 years after you stop taking the pill, your risk of breast cancer goes back to normal. If you have a family history of breast cancer, you may feel that this increase in risk, however small it is, is not worth taking. However, doctors do not think using the contraceptive pill is likely to increase the risk in women who already have close relatives with breast cancer. Where you can get the progestogen-only pill Most types of contraception are available for free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries – talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics  some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics  sexual health clinics – they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services  some young people''s services – call 0300 123 7123 for more information Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching by postcode or town. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you''re under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won''t tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you''re given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They''ll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won''t make you. The only time a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you''re at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.  Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 29/12/2014 Next review due: 29/12/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

(354, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/cosmetic-treatments-guide/Pages/laser-hair-removal.aspx', 'Hair removal, laser', 'Laser hair removal', '', 'Laser hair removal is a cosmetic procedure that uses a powerful laser or ''intense pulsed light'' (IPL) to remove unwanted hair. This light source heats and destroys hair follicles in the skin, which disrupts hair growth. Common areas to treat are the face, legs, arms, underarms and bikini line. It can be helpful for women with hirsutism (excessive hair growth). Generally, it''s most effective on women with pale skin and dark hair, and doesn''t work so well on women with dark skin.  Before you go ahead… Laser hair removal can be expensive, and has its limitations. Cost: In the UK, laser hair removal costs between £40 and £400, depending on the area of skin and number of sessions included. You may be recommended four to six sessions, spaced about four to six weeks apart. Limitations: The results of laser hair removal are not permanent. They usually last from weeks to months, and regular sessions may be needed to achieve and maintain the desired effect. There''s no guarantee it will clear all the hair. Safety: Take time to find a reputable practitioner who is properly qualified and practises in a clean, safe and appropriate environment. Ask the practitioner what you should do if something were to go wrong. What it involves You’ll need to shave the area of skin the day before your appointment. On the day, you’ll wear specially designed goggles to protect your eyes during the procedure. Local anaesthetic isn’t necessary. The practitioner usually applies a cool gel or cooling air spray to the area of skin. They then press a hand-held device to your skin and trigger the laser. This may feel like an elastic band snapping at your skin. Each session may take between 15 minutes to over an hour. The number of sessions needed depends on the area to be lasered and the system used.  Afterwards The area may be red with a raised rash for up to 24 hours afterwards. Holding an ice pack to the skin may help (try a pack of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel). Your skin will be more sensitive to the sun after laser hair removal. Avoid sun exposure and tanning beds for at least a week after treatment, and use sunscreen. On rare occasions, laser hair removal can result in: a crust or blister on your skin, which may take up to 10 days to heal  lightening or darkening of the skin for several months afterwards scarring excessive swelling, which may last up to seven days bruising, which may last up to 15 days burns a rare condition called livedo reticularis, where skin becomes mottled a skin reaction called erythema ab igne, caused by prolonged or repeated exposure to the laser or IPL What to do if you have problems If you''re not happy with the results or are experiencing problems, take up the matter with your practitioner through the clinic where you were treated. If there are any complications that require medical attention, it is best that you go back to the practitioner who treated you. If this is not possible, you can go to your GP or local accident and emergency (A&E) department.

(355, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/male-pill.aspx', 'Male contraceptive pill', 'What is the male pill?', '', 'In the past 50 years, there have been few changes in male contraception compared with the range of options available to women. Today, the only contraceptive methods available to men are: condoms – a barrier form of contraception that stops sperm reaching and fertilising an egg vasectomy – a minor surgical procedure that stops sperm being ejaculated from the penis during sex (it is usually permanent)  Some men use withdrawal to try to prevent pregnancy, when they pull their penis out of their partner''s vagina before ejaculating. However, this is not a recommended method of contraception. Sperm can be released from the penis before ejaculation. Ongoing research There are many ongoing research projects into different methods of male contraception. Researchers are optimistic that a safe, effective and reversible method of male contraception will eventually become a reality, although this is still several years away.  Types of research There are two main areas of research into male contraception: hormonal contraception – where synthetic (man-made) hormones are used to temporarily stop the development of healthy sperm non-hormonal methods – where other techniques are used to prevent healthy sperm from entering a woman''s vagina Hormonal contraception In fertile men, new sperm cells are constantly created in the testicles. This process is triggered by the hormone testosterone. The goal of hormonal contraception research is to find a way of temporarily blocking the effects of testosterone so testicles stop producing healthy sperm cells. However, this needs to be achieved without lowering testosterone levels to such an extent that it triggers side effects, such as a loss of sexual desire. Synthetic testosterone and other steroid combinations One way of doing this is by giving men a synthetic version of testosterone, together with a hormone called progestogen. Progestogens are synthetic versions of a female sex hormone often found in female hormonal contraceptives, such as the progestogen-only pill.  This approach stops the testes producing testosterone which, in most cases, prevents normal sperm production. However, at the same time it keeps the amount of testosterone in the blood normal, preventing side effects. This is a very effective approach, but some men still carry on producing enough sperm to cause a pregnancy. The reason why this happens is unknown, but it may be that some men carry on producing enough testosterone to continue to stimulate some sperm production. Research is now focusing on different combinations of synthetic testosterone and progestogens. Several trials in different countries are looking at the effectiveness and long-term safety of hormonal contraceptives for men, including some phase III trials. Phase III trials are the last clinical trials carried out before a medicine is given a marketing licence. An important disadvantage of using synthetic testosterone is that sperm production is suppressed at different rates in men of different ethnic origins. These differences may be due to genetic, dietary or environmental factors, but the exact reasons are unknown. Understanding the reasons may lead to new ways of providing effective contraception for all men of diverse ethnic backgrounds. Non-hormonal contraception Many of the non-hormonal methods of contraception currently being studied involve the vas deferens. The vas deferens is the tube that sperm pass through on their way to the penis. This tube is cut during a vasectomy. RISUG and the IVD   One promising avenue of research is a technique called reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG). During this technique, a non-toxic synthetic chemical is injected into the vas deferens. The chemical reacts and blocks the vas deferens. It also kills sperm when they come into contact with it. The chemical is effective almost immediately after it is injected. The chemical stays in place until a man decides that he wants to have children. It can then be washed out using another injection which dissolves and flushes it out of the vas deferens. A variation of this technique is the intra-vas device (IVD). It involves injecting a "plug" into the vas deferens which can be removed later. The IVD filters out the sperm as it passes through the vas deferens.  Initial results of RISUG and IVD are promising, but further research is needed to assess the long-term effectiveness and safety of both techniques. Reasearch published in 2013 found that blocking certain proteins in the bodies of male mice rendered them infertile, but did not affect their sexual behaviour or the quality of their sperm. It prevented the sperm cells from being launched during ejaculation. When the mice''s sperm was used to artificially inseminate female mice, it resulted in pregnancies and healthy baby mice. If a way can be found to block these proteins in human males, this may take research a step closer to producing a male contraceptive pill. However, the research is in the very early stages and a male pill has not been developed. You can find out more about the research into proteins, mice and sperm.   Epididymis Other research is focusing on the epididymis. This is a long, coiled tube behind the testicles that allows sperm to mature normally, which is essential for normal fertility.

The aim is to improve hooded or droopy eyelids or eye bags. Before you go ahead, be sure about your reasons for wanting eyelid surgery. Bear in mind the cost, the risks, and the fact the results can''t be guaranteed.  It''s a good idea to discuss your plans with your GP first. There might be a medical condition affecting your eyelids or a reason why the operation isn''t appropriate for you.

Read on to find out: How much does eyelid surgery cost?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems  More information  How much does it cost?  In the UK, a blepharoplasty may cost anywhere between £2,000 and £6,000. You should also factor in the cost of any consultations, further surgery or follow-up care that may be needed. Where do I go? If you''re looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform eyelid surgery.  All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC. The CQC publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. Also, research the surgeon or ophthalmologist who is going to carry out the surgery. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor''s fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many operations they''ve performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? A blepharoplasty can be done under local anaesthetic with sedation or under general anaesthetic. The surgeon would need to know about any medicine you may be taking to reduce your risk of blood clots, such as aspirin or warfarin. Surgery on the upper eyelids generally involves: making a cut (incision) along the eyelid crease in the natural skin fold of the eyelid removing excess skin, fat or muscle closing up the incision – the scar will be hidden in the natural fold of the eyelid Surgery on the lower eyelids generally involves: making an incision either just below the lower lashes or on the inside of the eyelid moving or removing fat from the bags under the eyes, and sometimes also a small amount of skin supporting the muscles and tendon of the eyelid if necessary The surgeon will normally apply thin, sticky strips called suture strips to support the eyelids after surgery. These are usually removed up to a week later. An upper blepharoplasty may take about one hour. Surgery on the lower lid may take up to two hours. Most patients can go home the same day. Recovery It''s advisable to take about a week off work to recover from eyelid surgery. It may be obvious for a little longer than a week that you''ve just had eyelid surgery. You won''t be able to drive for a number of days after the operation. Bruises, scars and redness may take several weeks to fade. You probably need to: prop your head up with pillows for a couple of days when resting to reduce the swelling gently clean your eyelids using prescribed ointment or eyedrops hold a cold pack to your eye for a few days – try a pack of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from the sun and wind take paracetamol or another prescribed painkiller to relieve any mild pain You should avoid: strenuous activity and swimming for a few days smoking contact lenses and rubbing the eyes Side effects to expect It''s common after eyelid surgery to temporarily have: puffy, numb eyelids that are difficult to close at night irritated, sensitive or watery eyes – this may last a few weeks bruising that looks like a black eye pink scars – these eventually fade to almost be invisible What could go wrong Eyelid surgery can occasionally result in:  temporary blurred or double vision your eyes looking slightly asymmetrical a pool of blood collecting under the skin (haematoma) – this usually disappears on its own after a few weeks noticeable scarring Rarely, it can result in more serious problems, including:  injury to eye muscles the lower eyelid drooping away from the eye and turning outwards (ectropion) the lower eyelid becoming pulled down and showing the white of the eye below the iris (eyelid retraction) blindness – this is extremely rare Also, any type of operation carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding developing a blood clot in a vein infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, patients find the desired effect wasn''t achieved and feel they need another operation. What to do if you have problems  Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong, and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms. If you''re not happy with the results, or you think the procedure wasn''t carried out properly, you should take up the matter with the surgeon who treated you. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC).

It can be expensive, the results aren''t guaranteed, and there are risks to weigh up. It involves inserting breast implants to increase the size of the breasts, change their shape, or make them more even. But before you go ahead, be absolutely sure about why you want them. Take time to reflect on your decision. It may help to read our article Is cosmetic surgery right for me? and to discuss it with your GP first. Read on to find out: How much does it cost? Where do I go? What does it involve? Choosing your implants  How long do breast implants last? Recovery Side effects to expect What could go wrong What to do if you have problems   More information How much does it cost? In the UK, breast implant surgery costs around £3,500-£7,000, plus the cost of any consultations or follow-up care that may not be included in the price. If there is a problem with the implant and it has to be removed, you''ll usually need to pay for any replacement and further surgery yourself. Where do I go? If you''re looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform the operation.  All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC. The CQC publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care.

You may also want to find out: how many operations they''ve performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong their own patient satisfaction rates Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? Breast implant surgery is carried out under general anaesthetic. The operation involves: making a cut (incision) in the skin next to or below the breast positioning the implant – either between your breast tissue and chest muscle, or behind your chest muscle stitching the incision and covering it with a dressing The operation takes between 60 and 90 minutes. You may be able to go home the same day, but may need to stay in hospital overnight if the operation was scheduled late in the day. Pain relief is provided if you experience any discomfort afterwards. Choosing your implants The type of implants most commonly used in the UK are silicone gel, but saline implants are also available. Your surgeon should discuss with you what shape and type of implant is best for you, but below is a rough guide. Silicone gel implants These are filled with either soft or firm silicone gel. Implants filled with the firmer gel are called cohesive gel implants. Some have a polyurethane coating.  Pros: Generally less likely to wrinkle than saline implants. The soft type can give a natural feel. Polyurethane-coated ones are claimed to reduce the risk of capsular contracture and the implant rotating – see What could go wrong. Cons: If a soft gel implant ruptures, silicone could spread into your breast and cause siliconomas – see What could go wrong. This is much less of an issue if cohesive implants are used, but this firmer gel may not feel as natural. Polyurethane-coated ones may cause a temporary skin reaction. Saline solution implants  Pros: If the implant were to rupture, the saline solution would be safely absorbed or passed out of your body.   Cons: More likely to rupture or deflate earlier than silicone, as they tend to slowly deflate over time. More prone to wrinkling or folding. May feel less natural than soft silicone. Where to place them The implants can either be placed between the breast and the chest muscle or behind the muscle. You''ll need to decide with your surgeon where is best for you, but here''s a rough guide. Between the breast and the muscle: most natural location less discomfort immediately after the operation chest muscle is not damaged Under the muscle: extra tissue coverage less risk of rippling and capsular contracture – see What could go wrong How long do breast implants last? Breast implants will not last a lifetime. They are likely to need replacing at some point. Some women may need further surgery after about 10 years, either because of problems with the implants or because their breasts have changed around the implants. Recovery It can take a few weeks to fully recover from breast implant surgery. You may need to take a week or two off work and shouldn''t drive for at least one week. Some surgeons recommend wearing a sports bra 24 hours a day for up to three months after breast surgery. You''d need to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous exercise for at least a month, and keep your breast scars out of direct sunlight for about a year. After a week or two: Stitches would be removed (unless you had dissolvable stitches). Within six weeks: You''d usually be able to return to most of your normal activities. After a few months: Your breasts would usually start to look and feel more natural. You may be able to stop wearing your sports bra. Side effects to expect It''s fairly common after breast implant surgery to have:  temporary pain, swelling and bruising a tight feeling in your chest for a few weeks   What could go wrong Breast implants can occasionally result in problems, including: thick, obvious scarring the breast tissue feeling hard because scar tissue has shrunk around the implant (capsular contracture) a ruptured implant – this may cause small tender lumps (siliconomas) only detectable on breast scans, and the implant will need to be removed creases or folds in the implant the implant rotating within the breast, which may lead to an abnormal shape ''rippling'' of the implant – this occurs when the implant is covered by only a thin layer of tissue, which sticks to the implant surface and is very difficult to treat nerve problems in the nipples – they may become more sensitive, less sensitive, or completely desensitised; this can be temporary or permanent not being able to breastfeed or producing slightly less breast milk than you would without implants – your baby won''t be harmed if you breastfeed with implants Also, any type of operation carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding infection – this is rare, but may mean the implant needs to be removed an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic a blood clot forming in the deep veins You should also be aware of a possible link between breast implants and a rare type of immune system cell cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). ALCL has been reported in a very small number of women who have had breast implants. So far, it has only been found in scar tissue that develops around textured breast implants. The surgeon should explain how likely all these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, people find the desired effect wasn''t achieved and feel they need another operation. Mammograms after implants Mammograms for breast cancer screening are less accurate if you have implants, so it''s important you tell the radiographer about them. It''s safe to have mammograms and they do not cause implants to rupture. They may reveal an implant that has ruptured. What to do if you have problems Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms, such as redness of your breast skin, a burning sensation or unusual swelling. If you experience a problem with your breast implants, you can report this through the government''s Yellow Card Scheme. By reporting any issues, you are helping to provide more information on the safety of the implants. If you are not happy with the results or think the procedure wasn''t carried out properly, you should take up the matter with your surgeon through the hospital or clinic where you were treated. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC). For more information, read the Royal College of Surgeon''s advice on What if things go wrong? Breast implant registry From 10 October 2016, everyone who has a breast enlargement operation in England will be able to have their breast implants recorded on a national registry.  This measure has been introduced following the 2010 PIP implant scandal, when many women were unable to find out whether they had been given the faulty implants. This registry is designed to capture all breast implant surgery carried out both privately and by the NHS, so patients can be easily traced if implants ever need to be recalled and removed. Talk to your surgeon if you want data about your implants to be stored. Find out more about the registry.

(358, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Accidents-and-first-aid/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Bleeding (haemorrhage)', 'First aid - NHS Choices', 'First aid  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Every year in the UK, thousands of people die or are seriously injured in incidents. Many deaths could be prevented if first aid is given before emergency services arrive. What to do If someone is injured you should: first check that you and the casualty aren''t in any danger, and, if possible, make the situation safe if necessary, dial 999 or 112 for an ambulance when it''s safe to do so carry out basic first aid Read more about what to do after an incident. If someone is unconscious and breathing If a person is unconscious but breathing, and has no other injuries that would stop them being moved, place them in the recovery position until help arrives. Keep them under observation to ensure they continue to breathe normally, and don''t obstruct their airway. If someone is unconscious and not breathing If a person isn''t breathing normally after an incident, call an ambulance and start CPR straight away. Use hands-only CPR if you aren''t trained to perform rescue breaths. Read more about CPR, including instructions and a video about hands-only CPR. Common accidents and emergencies Below, in alphabetical order, are some of the most common injuries that need emergency treatment in the UK and information about how to deal with them: anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) bleeding burns and scalds   choking  drowning  electric shock (domestic)  fractures  heart attack  poisoning  shock  stroke Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) is a severe allergic reaction that can occur after an insect sting or after eating certain foods. The adverse reaction can be very fast, occurring within seconds or minutes of coming into contact with the substance the person is allergic to (allergen). During anaphylactic shock, it may be difficult for the person to breathe, as their tongue and throat may swell, obstructing their airway. Call 999 or 112 immediately if you think someone is experiencing anaphylactic shock. Check if the person is carrying any medication. Some people who know they have severe allergies may carry an adrenaline self-injector, which is a type of pre-loaded syringe. You can either help the person administer their medication or, if you''re trained to do so, give it to them yourself. After the injection, continue to look after the person until medical help arrives. All casualties who have had an intramuscular or subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of adrenaline must be seen and medically checked by a healthcare professional as soon as possible after the injection has been given. Make sure they''re comfortable and can breathe as best they can while waiting for medical help to arrive. If they''re conscious, sitting upright is normally the best position for them. Read more about treating anaphylaxis. Bleeding If someone is bleeding heavily, the main aim is to prevent further blood loss and minimise the effects of shock (see below). First, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible. If you have disposable gloves, use them to reduce the risk of any infection being passed on. Check that there''s nothing embedded in the wound. If there is, take care not to press down on the object. Instead, press firmly on either side of the object and build up padding around it before bandaging, to avoid putting pressure on the object itself. If nothing is embedded: apply and maintain pressure to the wound with your gloved hand, using a clean pad or dressing if possible; continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops  use a clean dressing to bandage the wound firmly if bleeding continues through the pad, apply pressure to the wound  until the bleeding stops and then apply another pad over the top and bandage it in place; don''t remove the original pad or dressing, but continue to check that the bleeding has stopped  If a body part, such as a finger, has been severed, place it in a plastic bag or wrap it in cling film and make sure it goes with the casualty to hospital. Always seek medical help for bleeding unless it''s minor. If someone has a nosebleed that hasn''t stopped after 20 minutes, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Read more about how to treat minor bleeding from cuts and grazes and how to treat nosebleeds. Haemostatic dressings and tourniquets In certain situations, where bleeding is very severe and from the body’s extremities, such as the head, neck and torso, it may be appropriate to use haemostatic dressings or a tourniquet. Haemostatic dressings contain properties that help the blood to clot (thicken) quicker. A tourniquet is a band that''s wrapped tightly around a limb to stop blood loss. Haemostatic dressings and tourniquets should only be used by people who have been trained to apply them. Burns and scalds If someone has a burn or scald: cool the burn as quickly as possible with cool running water for at least 20 minutes, or until the pain is relieved call 999 or seek medical help, if needed while cooling the burn, carefully remove any clothing or jewellery, unless it''s attached to the skin if you''re cooling a large burnt area, particularly in babies, children and elderly people, be aware that it may cause hypothermia (it may be necessary to stop cooling the burn to avoid hypothermia)  cover the burn loosely with cling film; if cling film isn''t available, use a clean, dry dressing or non-fluffy material; don''t wrap the burn tightly, because swelling may lead to further injury don''t apply creams, lotions or sprays to the burn For chemical burns, wear protective gloves, remove any affected clothing, and rinse the burn with cool running water for at least 20 minutes to wash out the chemical. If possible, determine the cause of the injury. In certain situations where a chemical is regularly handled, a specific chemical antidote may be available to use. Be careful not to contaminate and injure yourself with the chemical, and wear protective clothing if necessary. Call 999 or 112 for immediate medical help. Read more about how to treat burns and scalds. Choking The information below is for choking in adults and children over one year old. Read what to do if a baby under one year old is choking. Mild choking If the airway is only partly blocked, the person will usually be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe. In situations like this, a person will usually be able to clear the blockage themselves. If choking is mild: encourage the person to cough to try to clear the blockage ask them to try to spit out the object if it’s in their mouth don''t put your fingers in their mouth to help them because they may accidentally bite you If coughing doesn’t work, start back blows (see below). Severe choking  If choking is severe, the person won’t be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe, and without help they’ll eventually become unconscious. To help an adult or child over one year old: Stand behind the person and slightly to one side. Support their chest with one hand. Lean the person forward so that the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down. Give up to five sharp blows between the person’s shoulder blades with the heel of your hand (the heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist). Check if the blockage has cleared. If not, give up to five abdominal thrusts (see below). Abdominal thrusts shouldn''t be used on babies under one year old, pregnant women or obese people. To perform abdominal thrusts on a person who is severely choking and isn’t in one of the above groups: Stand behind the person who is choking. Place your arms around their waist and bend them well forward. Clench one fist and place it just above the person''s belly button. Place your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards. Repeat this up to five times. The aim is to get the obstruction out with each chest thrust, rather than necessarily doing all five. If the obstruction doesn''t clear after three cycles of back blows and chest thrusts, dial 999 or 112 to ask for an ambulance, and continue until help arrives. The person choking should always be seen by a healthcare professional afterwards to check for any injuries or small pieces of the obstruction that remain. Drowning If someone is in difficulty in water, don''t enter the water to help unless it''s absolutely essential. Once the person is on land, if they''re not breathing, open the airway and give five initial rescue breaths before starting CPR. If you''re alone, perform CPR for one minute before calling for emergency help. Find out how to give CPR, including rescue breaths. If the person is unconscious but still breathing, put them into the recovery position with their head lower than their body and call an ambulance immediately. Continue to observe the casualty to ensure they don''t stop breathing or that their airway becomes obstructed. Electric shock (domestic) If someone has had an electric shock, switch off the electrical current at the mains to break the contact between the person and the electrical supply. If you can''t reach the mains supply: don''t go near or touch the person until you''re sure the electrical supply has been switched off   once the power supply has been switched off, and if the person isn''t breathing, dial 999 or 112 to for an ambulance Afterwards, seek medical help - unless the electric shock is very minor. Fractures It can be difficult to tell if a person has a broken bone or a joint, as opposed to a simple muscular injury. If you''re in any doubt, treat the injury as a broken bone. If the person is unconscious, has difficulty breathing or is bleeding severely, these must be dealt with first, by controlling the bleeding with direct pressure and performing CPR. If the person is conscious, prevent any further pain or damage by keeping the fracture as still as possible until you get them safely to hospital. Assess the injury and decide whether the best way to get them to hospital is by ambulance or car. For example, if the pain isn’t too severe, you could transport them to hospital by car. It''s always best to get someone else to drive, so that you can deal with the casualty if they deteriorate – for example, if they lose consciousness as a result of the pain or start to vomit. However, if: they’re in a lot of pain and in need of strong painkilling medication, don''t move them and call an ambulance it''s obvious they have a broken leg, don''t move them, but keep them in the position you found them in and call an ambulance you suspect they have injured or broken their back, don''t move them and call an ambulance Don''t give the casualty anything to eat or drink, because they may need an anaesthetic (numbing medication) when they reach hospital. You can read more about specific broken bones in the following pages:  broken ankle broken arm or wrist broken collarbone broken nose broken toe fractured ribs hip fracture Heart attack A heart attack is one of the most common life-threatening heart conditions in the UK. If you think a person is having, or has had, a heart attack, sit them down and make them as comfortable as possible, and call 999 or 112 for an ambulance. Symptoms of a heart attack include: chest pain – the pain is usually located in the centre or left side of the chest and can feel like a sensation of pressure, tightness or squeezing pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is travelling from the chest down one or both arms, or into the jaw, neck, back or abdomen (tummy)  Sit the person down and make them comfortable. If they''re conscious, reassure them and ask them to take a 300mg aspirin tablet to chew slowly (unless you know they shouldn''t take aspirin – for example, if they''re under 16 or allergic to it). If the person has any medication for angina, such as a spray or tablets, help them to take it. Monitor their vital signs, such as breathing, until help arrives. If the person deteriorates and becomes unconscious, open their airway, check their breathing and, if necessary, start CPR. Re-alert the emergency services that the casualty is now in cardiac arrest. Poisoning Poisoning is potentially life-threatening. Most cases of poisoning in the UK happen when a person has swallowed a toxic substance, such as bleach, taken an overdose of a prescription medication, or eaten wild plants and fungi. Alcohol poisoning can cause similar symptoms. If you think someone has swallowed a poisonous substance, call 999 or 112 to get immediate medical help and advice. The effects of poisoning depend on the substance swallowed, but can include vomiting, loss of consciousness, pain or a burning sensation. The following advice is important: Find out what''s been swallowed, so you can tell the paramedic or doctor. Do not give the person anything to eat or drink unless a healthcare professional advises you to. Do not try to cause vomiting. Stay with the person, because their condition may get worse and they could become unconscious. If the person becomes unconscious while you''re waiting for help to arrive, check for breathing and, if necessary, perform CPR. Don''t perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the casualty''s mouth or airway is contaminated with the poison. Don''t leave them if they''re unconscious because they may roll onto their back, which could cause them to vomit. The vomit could then enter their lungs and make them choke. If the casualty is conscious and breathing normally, put them into the recovery position and continue to monitor their conscious state and breathing. Read more about treating someone who''s been poisoned and treating alcohol poisoning. Shock In the case of a serious injury or illness, it''s important to look out for signs of shock (see below). Shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the circulatory system fails to provide enough oxygenated blood to the body and, as a result, deprives the vital organs of oxygen. This is usually due to severe blood loss, but it can also occur after severe burns, severe vomiting, a heart attack, bacterial infection or a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). The type of shock described here isn''t the same as the emotional response of feeling shocked, which can also occur after an accident. Signs of shock include: pale, cold, clammy skin sweating rapid, shallow breathing weakness and dizziness feeling sick and possibly vomiting thirst yawning sighing Seek medical help immediately if you notice that someone has any of the above signs of shock. If they do, you should: dial 999 or 112 as soon as possible and ask for an ambulance treat any obvious injuries lie the person down if their injuries allow you to and, if possible, raise and support their legs use a coat or blanket to keep them warm don''t give them anything to eat or drink give them lots of comfort and reassurance monitor the person – if they stop breathing, start CPR and re-alert the emergency services Stroke The FAST guide is the most important thing to remember when dealing with people who have had a stroke. The earlier they receive treatment, the better. Call for emergency medical help straight away. If you think a person has had a stroke, use the FAST guide: Facial weakness – is the person unable to smile evenly, or are their eyes or mouth droopy? Arm weakness – is the person only able to raise one arm? Speech problems – is the person unable to speak clearly or understand you? Time to call 999 or 112 – for emergency help if a person has any of these symptoms Read more about the symptoms of a stroke. Getting help in an emergency In the UK, 999 has been the emergency services number for many years. However, you can now also call 112 to get help, which is the single emergency telephone number for the EU. This number will give you access to the emergency services wherever you are in the EU. When you call 999 or 112, you''ll be asked what service you need, as well as: your telephone number the address you''re calling from  a brief description of what''s wrong with the casualty and whether they''re bleeding, unconscious or not breathing The call handler may advise you on how to assist the casualty until help arrives.

(359, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/breastfeeding-diet.aspx', 'Breastfeeding and diet', 'Breastfeeding and diet - Pregnancy and baby guide - NHS Choices', '', 'You don''t need to eat anything special while you''re breastfeeding. But it''s a good idea for you, just like everyone else, to eat a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes: at least five portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables a day, including fresh, frozen, tinned and dried fruit and vegetables, and no more than one 150ml glass of 100% unsweetened juice starchy foods, such as wholemeal bread, pasta, rice and potatoes plenty of fibre from wholemeal bread and pasta, breakfast cereals, rice, pulses such as beans and lentils, and fruit and vegetables – after birth, some women have bowel problems and constipation, and fibre helps with both of these protein, such as lean meat and chicken, fish, eggs, nuts, seeds, soya foods and pulses – at least two portions of fish a week is recommended, including some oily fish dairy foods, such as milk, cheese and yoghurt – these contain calcium and are a source of protein drinking plenty of fluids – have a drink beside you when you settle down to breastfeed: water and skimmed or semi-skimmed milk are all good choices See more detailed advice about healthy eating. Small amounts of what you''re eating and drinking can pass to your baby through your breast milk. If you think a food you''re eating is affecting your baby and they''re unsettled, talk to your GP or health visitor, or contact the National Breastfeeding Helpline on 0300 100 0212. Vitamins and breastfeeding Everyone, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, should consider taking a daily supplement containing 10mcg of vitamin D. From late March/April to the end of September, the majority of people aged five years and above will probably get enough vitamin D from sunlight when they are outdoors. So you might choose not to take a vitamin D supplement during these months You can get all the other vitamins and minerals you need by eating a varied and balanced diet. Ask your GP or health visitor where to get vitamin D supplements. You may be able to get free vitamin supplements without a prescription if you''re eligible for Healthy Start. You''re entitled to free NHS prescriptions for 12 months after your baby is born. You will need to show a valid maternity exemption certificate to prove your entitlement. If you did not apply for a maternity exemption certificate while you were pregnant, you can still apply at any time in the 12 months after your baby is born. Healthy snack ideas for breastfeeding mums The following snacks are quick and simple to make, and will give you energy and strength: fresh fruit sandwiches filled with salad, grated cheese, mashed salmon or cold meat  yoghurts and fromage frais hummus with bread or vegetable sticks ready-to-eat dried apricots, figs or prunes vegetable and bean soups fortified unsweetened breakfast cereals, muesli and other wholegrain cereals with milk milky drinks or a 150ml glass of 100% unsweetened fruit juice baked beans on toast or a baked potato Healthy Start vouchers You can get Healthy Start vouchers if you''re pregnant or have a young child under four and are getting certain benefits or tax credits, or you''re pregnant and under 18. These can be spent on milk and fresh or frozen fruit and vegetables, or they can be put towards formula milk if you''re not breastfeeding. You can''t use vouchers to buy fruit and veg with added fat, sugar and salt or flavourings, such as oven chips and seasoned stir fries. You can also get Healthy Start vouchers for free vitamin supplements. For more information or an application leaflet, visit the Healthy Start website, or call the helpline on 0845 607 6823. If you''re already receiving Healthy Start vouchers, ask your midwife or health visitor where you can exchange the vouchers for vitamins. Eating fish while breastfeeding Eating fish is good for your health and your baby''s, but while you are breastfeeding you should have no more than two portions of oily fish a week. A portion is around 140g. Oily fish includes fresh mackerel, sardines, trout and tuna, but not canned tuna, as the good fats are lost in the canning process. All adults should also eat no more than one portion a week of shark, swordfish or marlin. See more about eating fish while pregnant or breastfeeding. Caffeine and breastfeeding Caffeine can reach your baby through your breast milk and may keep them awake. Caffeine occurs naturally in lots of foods and drinks, including coffee, tea and chocolate. It''s also added to some soft drinks and energy drinks, as well as some cold and flu remedies. Caffeine is a stimulant and can make your baby restless. It''s a good idea for pregnant and breastfeeding women to restrict their caffeine intake to less than 300mg a day: one mug of filter coffee: 140mg one mug of instant coffee: 100mg one mug of tea: 75mg one can of energy drink: up to 80mg one 50g plain chocolate bar: up to 50mg one cola drink (354mls): 40mg Try decaffeinated tea and coffee, herbal teas, 100% fruit juice (but no more than one 150ml glass per day) or mineral water. Avoid energy drinks, which can be very high in caffeine. Peanuts and breastfeeding If you''d like to eat peanuts or foods containing peanuts, such as peanut butter, while breastfeeding, you can do so as part of a healthy, balanced diet (unless, of course, you are allergic to them). There''s no clear evidence that eating peanuts while breastfeeding affects your baby''s chances of developing a peanut allergy. If you have any questions or concerns, you can talk to your GP, midwife or health visitor. See more about food allergies.

(360, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/bottle-feeding-advice.aspx', 'Bottle feeding', 'Bottle feeding advice - Pregnancy and baby guide - NHS Choices', '', 'If you are planning to bottle feed with expressed breast milk or infant formula, these tips will help keep your baby safe and healthy. Buying bottle feeding equipment You will need a number of bottles and teats, as well as sterilising equipment. There''s no evidence that one type of teat or bottle is better than any other. But some feeding bottles have shapes or patterns that make them difficult to clean thoroughly. As hygiene is so important, simple bottles that are easy to wash and sterilise are probably best. Preparing bottle feeds Make sure your bottles and teats are sterilised. If you''re using infant formula, pay close attention to the instructions on the packet when you make up the feed. How to bottle feed your baby Make sure you are sitting comfortably. Enjoy holding your baby and looking into their eyes as you feed them. Bottle feeding is a chance to feel close to your baby and get to know them. Hold your baby fairly upright for bottle feeds. Support their head so they can breathe and swallow comfortably. Brush the teat against your baby''s lips and, when your they open their mouth wide, let them draw in the teat.   Always give your baby plenty of time to feed. Keep the teat full When bottle feeding, keep the teat full of milk, otherwise your baby will take in air. If the teat becomes flattened while you''re feeding, gently poke a clean finger into the corner of your baby''s mouth to release the suction. If the teat gets blocked, replace it with another sterile teat. Winding your baby Your baby may need short breaks during the feed and may need to burp sometimes. When your baby does not want any more feed, hold them upright and gently rub or pat their back to bring up any wind. This may only be a small amount. Throw away unused formula Don''t forget to throw away any unused formula or breast milk after you have finished feeding your baby. Go with the flow Babies differ in how often they want to feed and how much milk they want to take. Feed your baby when they''re hungry, and don''t try to force them to finish a bottle. Don''t leave your baby Never leave a baby alone to feed with a propped-up bottle as they may choke on the milk. Help with bottle feeding Talk to your midwife, health visitor or other mothers with experience of bottle feeding if you need help. You''ll find the phone number for your health visitor in your baby''s red book.  Common questions about bottle feeding Why doesn''t my baby settle after a feed? If your baby swallows air while bottle feeding and is then put down to sleep, they may feel uncomfortable and cry. After a feed, it''s usually helpful to hold your baby upright against your shoulder or propped forward on your lap. Gently rub their back so any trapped air can find its way out easily. But there''s no need to overdo it – wind is not as big a problem as many people think. Why does my baby sometimes vomit after a feed? Some babies bring up more milk than others during or just after a feed. This is sometimes called possetting, regurgitation or reflux. Keep a muslin square handy just in case. It can be upsetting when this happens, and you may be worried that something is wrong. If it happens often, or your baby is violently sick, appears to be in pain or you''re worried for any other reason, talk to your health visitor or GP. Check that the hole in your baby''s teat is not too big – giving milk too quickly can cause sickness. Sitting your baby upright on your lap after a feed may help. If your baby brings up a lot of milk, they may be hungry again quite quickly. Don''t force them to take more milk than they want during a feed. Every baby is different. Some prefer to feed little and often. Could formula feeding make my baby constipated? When using infant formula, always use the recommended amount of infant formula powder stated on the packet. Don''t add extra infant formula because using too much can make your baby constipated and may cause dehydration. If your baby is under eight weeks old and hasn''t passed a stool (had a poo) for two to three days, discuss this with your midwife, health visitor or GP, particularly if your baby is gaining weight slowly. Your baby should be gaining weight and have wet and dirty nappies. Infant formula and allergies If you think your baby might be allergic to or intolerant of infant formula, talk to your GP. If necessary, they can prescribe special formula feeds called extensively hydrolysed protein feeds. Some infant formula is labelled as hypoallergenic, but these are not suitable for babies with a diagnosed cows'' milk allergy. Always talk to your GP before using hypoallergenic or soya-based infant formula, as babies who are allergic to cows'' milk may also be allergic to soya. Read more about cows'' milk allergy and lactose intolerance. Page last reviewed: 17/02/2015 Next review due: 17/02/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

(361, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/contraceptive-injection.aspx', 'Contraceptive injections', 'The contraceptive injection - Contraception guide - NHS Choices', '', 'A woman can get pregnant if a man’s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the injection. At a glance: the contraceptive injection   How it works   Who can use it   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks   Where you can get it There are three types of contraceptive injections in the UK: Depo-Provera, which lasts for 12 weeks, Sayana Press, which lasts for 13 weeks, and Noristerat, which lasts for eight weeks. The most popular is Depo-Provera. Noristerat is usually used for only short periods of time – for example, if your partner is waiting for a vasectomy. The injection contains progestogen. This thickens the mucus in the cervix, stopping sperm reaching an egg. It also thins the womb lining and, in some, prevents the release of an egg. At a glance: the contraceptive injection If used correctly, the contraceptive injection is more than 99% effective. This means that less than one woman in 100 who use the injection will become pregnant in a year. The injection lasts for eight, 12 or 13 weeks (depending on the type), so you don''t have to think about contraception every day or every time you have sex. It can be useful for women who might forget to take the contraceptive pill every day. It can be useful for women who can''t use contraception that contains oestrogen. It''s not affected by medication. The contraceptive injection may provide some protection against cancer of the womb and pelvic inflammatory disease. Side effects can include weight gain, headaches, mood swings, breast tenderness and irregular bleeding. The injection can''t be removed from your body, so if you have side effects they''ll last as long as the injection and for some time afterwards. Your periods may become more irregular or longer, or stop altogether (amenorrhoea). Treatment is available if your bleeding is heavy or longer than normal – talk to your doctor or nurse about this. It can take up to one year for your fertility to return to normal after the injection wears off, so it may not be suitable if you want to have a baby in the near future. Using Depo-Provera affects your natural oestrogen levels, which can cause thinning of the bones.  The injection does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). By using condoms as well as the injection, you''ll help to protect yourself against STIs. How the injection works You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people''s services Find a clinic near you The contraceptive injections Depo-Provera and Noristerat are usually given into a muscle in your bottom, although sometimes may be given in a muscle in your upper arm. Sayana Press is given under the skin (subcutaneously) rather than into a muscle, in the abdomen or thigh. The contraceptive injection works in the same way as the implant. It steadily releases the hormone progestogen into your bloodstream. Progestogen is similar to the natural hormone progesterone, which is released by a woman''s ovaries during her period. The continuous release of progestogen: stops a woman releasing an egg every month (ovulation)  thickens the mucus from the cervix (neck of the womb), making it difficult for sperm to pass through to the womb and reach an unfertilised egg  makes the lining of the womb thinner, so that it is unable to support a fertilised egg The injection can be given at any time during your menstrual cycle, as long as you and your doctor are reasonably sure you are not pregnant. When it starts to work If you have the injection during the first five days of your cycle, you will be immediately protected against becoming pregnant.  If you have the injection on any other day of your cycle, you will not be protected against pregnancy for up to seven days. Use condoms or another method of contraception during this time. After giving birth You can have the contraceptive injection at any time after you have given birth, if you are not breastfeeding. If you are breastfeeding, the injection will usually be given after six weeks, although it may be given earlier if necessary. If you start injections on or before day 21 after giving birth, you will be immediately protected against becoming pregnant. If you start injections after day 21, you will need to use additional contraception for the following seven days. Heavy and irregular bleeding is more likely to occur if you have the contraceptive injection during the first few weeks after giving birth. It is safe to use contraceptive injections while you are breastfeeding. After a miscarriage or abortion You can have the injection immediately after a miscarriage or abortion, and you will be protected against pregnancy straight away. If you have the injection more than five days after a miscarriage or abortion, you''ll need to use additional contraception for seven days. Who can use the injection? Most women can be given the contraceptive injection. It may not be suitable if you: think you might be pregnant  want to keep having regular periods  have bleeding in between periods or after sex  have arterial disease or a history of heart disease or stroke have a blood clot in a blood vessel (thrombosis)  have liver disease  have migraines  have breast cancer or have had it in the past  have diabetes with complications  have cirrhosis or liver tumours are at risk of osteoporosis   Advantages and disadvantages of the injection The main advantages of the contraceptive injection are: each injection lasts for either eight, 12 or 13 weeks  the injection does not interrupt sex  the injection is an option if you cannot use oestrogen-based contraception, such as the combined pill, contraceptive patch or vaginal ring you do not have to remember to take a pill every day the injection is safe to use while you are breastfeeding  the injection is not affected by other medicines the injection may reduce heavy, painful periods and help with premenstrual symptoms for some women the injection offers some protection from pelvic inflammatory disease (the mucus from the cervix may stop bacteria entering the womb) and may also give some protection against cancer of the womb Using the contraceptive injection may have some disadvantages, which you should consider carefully before deciding on the right method of contraception for you. These are as follows: Disrupted periods Your periods may change significantly during the first year of using the injection. They will usually become irregular and may be very heavy, or shorter and lighter, or stop altogether. This may settle down after the first year, but may continue as long as the injected progestogen remains in your body. It can take a while for your periods and natural fertility to return after you stop using the injection. It takes around eight to 12 weeks for injected progestogen to leave the body, but you may have to wait longer for your periods to return to normal if you are trying to get pregnant. Until you are ovulating regularly each month, it can be difficult to work out when you are at your most fertile. In some cases, it can take three months to a year for your periods to return to normal. Weight gain You may put on weight when you use the contraceptive injection, particulaly if you are under 18 years old and are overweight with a BMI (body mass index) of 30 or over.    Other side effects that some women report are: headaches acne tender breasts changes in mood loss of sex drive Depo-Provera, oestrogen and bone risk Using Depo-Provera affects your natural oestrogen levels, which can cause thinning of the bones, but it does not increase your risk of breaking a bone. This isn''t a problem for most women, because the bone replaces itself when you stop the injection, and it doesn''t appear to cause any long-term problems. Thinning of the bones may be a problem for women who already have an increased risk of developing osteoporosis (for example, because they have low oestrogen, or a family history of osteoporosis). It may also be a concern for women under 18, because the body is still making bone at this age. Women under 18 may use Depo-Provera, but only after careful evaluation by a doctor. Will other medicines affect the injection? No – the contraceptive injection is not affected by other medication. Risks There is a small risk of infection at the site of the injection. In very rare cases, some people may have an allergic reaction to the injection. Where you can get it Most types of contraception are available free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries – talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics  sexual health clinics – they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people’s services (call 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching your postcode or town. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you''re under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won''t tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you''re given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They''ll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won''t make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you''re at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first. Page last reviewed: 12/01/2015 Next review due: 12/01/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

When should I introduce my baby to solid foods? Media last reviewed: 28/01/2015 Next review due: 28/01/2017 When to start introducing solid foods Introducing your baby to solid foods – sometimes called weaning or complementary feeding – should start when your baby is around six months old. It''s a really important step in their development, and it can be great fun to explore new flavours and textures together. To begin with, how much your baby takes is less important than getting them used to the idea of eating. They will still be getting most of their nutrition from breast milk or infant formula.  Babies don''t need three meals a day to start with, so you can begin by offering foods at a time that suits you both. Gradually, you''ll be able to increase the amount and variety of food your baby eats, until they can eventually eat the same as the rest of the family, in smaller portions. Why it pays to wait until they''re ready Research shows babies can get all the nutrients they need from breast milk or infant formula until they are around six months old. Waiting till then gives their digestive system time to develop fully so it can cope with solid foods. This includes solid foods made into purées and cereals added to milk. If you are breastfeeding, having breast milk alone up to the age of six months will protect your baby against infections. Breast milk will carry on protecting them from infections for as long as you carry on feeding. Whether your baby has breast milk or infant formula, waiting until they are ready for food will save a lot of time, too. They''ll quickly be able to feed themselves and with less mess, as they will be able to swallow properly. Three signs your baby is ready for their first food Every baby is an individual, but there are three clear signs that, together, show your baby is ready for solid foods alongside breast milk or formula. It''s very rare for these signs to appear together before your baby is six months old. 1. They can stay in a sitting position and hold their head steady. 2. They can co-ordinate their eyes, hands and mouth so they can look at the food, pick it up and put it in their mouth, all by themselves. 3. They can swallow food. Babies who are not ready will push their food back out with their tongue, so they get more round their face than they do in their mouths. Some signs that can be mistaken for a baby being ready for solid foods: chewing fists waking in the night when they have previously slept through wanting extra milk feeds These are normal behaviours and not necessarily a sign of hunger or being ready to start solid food. Starting solid foods won''t make them any more likely to sleep through the night. Extra feeds are usually enough until they''re ready for other food. Getting started with solid foods Always stay with your baby when they are eating in case they start to choke. Find out how to help a choking child. Let your baby enjoy touching and holding the food. Allow your baby to feed themselves, using their fingers, as soon as they show an interest. Don''t force your baby to eat – wait until the next time if they''re not interested this time. If you''re using a spoon, wait for your baby to open their mouth before you offer the food. Your baby may like to hold a spoon, too. Start by offering just a few pieces or teaspoons of food, once a day. Cool hot food and test it before giving it to your baby. Don''t add salt, sugar or stock cubes to your baby''s food or cooking water. See what other foods to avoid giving your baby. What foods to give your baby as they grow Feeding your baby from 0-6 months Your baby only needs breast milk or first infant formula. "Follow-on" formula isn''t suitable for babies under six months, and you don''t need to introduce it after six months either. Check with your health visitor or GP first if you want to introduce solid foods before six months. Babies and food allergies While variety in your baby''s diet is really important, there is a chance they may be allergic to certain foods. That''s why it''s important to introduce cows'' milk, eggs, wheat, gluten, nuts, peanuts, peanut products, seeds, fish and shellfish one at a time and not before six months. There is no evidence that waiting until your child is older will prevent them developing a food allergy. Once your baby is ready for solids, give them these foods in very small amounts and watch carefully for any symptoms of an allergic reaction. If your baby already has a known allergy, such as a diagnosed food allergy or eczema, or you have a family history of food allergies, eczema, asthma or hay fever, you may need to be particularly careful when introducing peanuts and peanut products. Talk to your GP or health visitor first. Remember, peanuts, like all nuts, should be crushed or ground. See more about food allergies in babies and toddlers. Baby food from 6 months First foods Your baby''s first foods can include mashed or soft cooked fruit and vegetables like parsnip, potato, yam, sweet potato, carrot, apple or pear, all cooled before eating. Soft fruits like peach or melon, or baby rice or baby cereal mixed with your baby''s usual milk, are good as well. Keep feeding your baby breast milk or infant formula, too, but don''t give them whole cows'' milk as a drink until they are one year old. Finger foods Finger food is food that is cut up into pieces big enough for your baby to hold in their fist with a bit sticking out. Pieces about the size of your own finger work well. Your baby learns to chew this way. Try grabbable bits of soft, ripe banana or avocado. Next foods  Once your baby is used to the foods above, they can have soft cooked meat such as chicken, mashed fish (check very carefully for any bones), pasta, noodles, toast, pieces of chapatti, lentils, rice and mashed hard-boiled eggs. They can also have full-fat dairy products such as yoghurt, fromage frais or custard. Choose products with no added sugar or less sugar. Whole cows'' milk can be used in cooking or mixed with food from six months. Cups Introduce a cup from around six months and offer sips of water with meals. Using an open cup or a free-flow cup without a valve will help your baby learn to sip and is better for their teeth. See more about cups for babies and toddlers. Vitamins The Department of Health recommends that all under-fives are given vitamin supplements containing vitamins A, C and D every day.  Babies who are having more than 500ml (about a pint) of infant formula a day shouldn''t be given vitamin supplements because formula is already fortified with nutrients. Read more about vitamins for babies and toddlers. Feeding your baby from 8-9 months Your baby will gradually move towards eating three meals a day. It will be a mixture of soft finger foods, and mashed or chopped foods. Your baby''s diet should consist of a variety of the following: fruit and vegetables; bread, rice, pasta, potatoes and other starchy foods; meat, fish, eggs, beans and other non-dairy sources of protein; and milk and dairy products. See advice on portion size (PDF, 3.6Mb) from First Steps Nutrition. Your baby''s food from 12 months Your baby will now be eating three meals a day, chopped if necessary, plus breast milk or whole cows'' milk and healthier snacks like fruit, vegetable sticks, toast and rice cakes. They can now drink whole cows'' milk. Choose full-fat dairy products as children under two need the extra fat and vitamins found in them. From two years old, if they are a good eater and growing well, they can have semi-skimmed milk. From five years old, 1% fat and skimmed milk is OK. You can give your baby: three to four servings a day of starchy food such as potatoes, bread and rice three to four servings a day of fruit and vegetables two servings a day of meat, fish, eggs, dhal or other pulses (beans and lentils) Read more about what to feed young children. What milk, when? For around the first six months you should feed your baby only breast milk or infant formula. Infant formula made from cows'' or goats'' milk is the only suitable alternative to breast milk in the first 12 months of your baby''s life. Only use soya-based infant formula if your GP has advised you to. Follow-on milks are available for babies over six months, but there is no need to change over to these. Cows'' milk can be mixed with food from six months and whole cows'' milk can be given as a drink from one year. Semi-skimmed milk can be introduced once your child is two years old, as long as they''re a good eater and they have a varied diet. Skimmed and 1% milk aren''t suitable for children under five, as they don''t contain enough calories. Infant formula, follow-on formula or growing-up milks are not needed once your baby is 12 months old. Goats'' and sheep''s milk are not suitable as a drink for babies under one year. You can give your child unsweetened calcium-fortified milk alternatives, such as soya, almond and oat drinks, as part of a healthy, balanced diet from the age of one. Toddlers and young children under the age of five should not be given rice drinks because of the levels of arsenic they contain. If your child has an allergy or intolerance to milk, talk to your health visitor or GP. They can advise you on suitable milk alternatives. See more about drinks for babies and toddlers.

(363, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/cosmetic-treatments-guide/Pages/botulinum-toxin-Botox-injections.aspx', 'Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections', 'Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections', '', 'Botulinum toxin injections, such as Botox and Dysport, are medical treatments that can also be used to help relax facial muscles. This makes lines and wrinkles, such as crow''s feet and frown lines, less obvious. They can temporarily alter your appearance without the need for surgery. When Botox or Dysport injections are used in this way for cosmetic reasons, they are not available on the NHS. Before you go ahead If you''re considering Botox or Dysport injections, be certain about why you want to have them. The injections are expensive, and have their limitations. Cost: In the UK, botulinum toxin injections cost £150-£350 per session, depending on the amount of product used. Limitations: The effect isn''t permanent. There''s no guarantee the desired effect will be achieved. The ageing process will still happen elsewhere – for example, Botox will not fix sagging eyelids. Safety: Take time to find a reputable practitioner who is properly qualified and practises in a clean, safe and appropriate environment. Ask the practitioner what you should do if something were to go wrong. Botulinum toxin is a prescription-only medicine that should only be prescribed and given by an appropriately trained healthcare professional, such as a doctor, dentist, pharmacist prescriber, or nurse prescriber. Legally, the prescriber can delegate the administration of the injections to another person, but they are responsible for ensuring it is given safely. You shouldn''t have botulinum injections if you''re pregnant or breastfeeding, since the effects on the baby aren''t known. What it involves You''ll need to first meet with the doctor, nurse prescriber, pharmacist prescriber or dentist who will prescribe the medicine. This should always be a face-to-face meeting.  They''ll want to fully understand your medical history and reasons for wanting the treatment before they go ahead. The person who prescribed the medicine might administer it, or they might delegate this task to another person. Local anaesthetic isn''t usually needed. Your skin is cleaned and small amounts of botulinum toxin are injected into the muscles of the face to be treated. Several injections are usually needed at different sites. It takes about 10 minutes. The injections may be a little painful. Most people tolerate the discomfort well. Afterwards You won''t see any difference straight away: it takes about three to five days before the injections take effect, and up to two weeks for the full effect to be seen. Avoid massaging or rubbing the treated areas for up to three days. The effects generally last for about four to six months. If you want to maintain the effect, you''ll need regular follow-up injections. Risks The risks of treatment include: flu-like symptoms – including a headache – for the first 24 hours after treatment bruising at the injection site temporary weakness and droopiness of your facial features – for example, eyelids or eyebrows may droop temporarily if the injected medicine moves into these areas  your body developing resistance to the treatment if it''s repeated too frequently In rare cases, serious problems can develop in the hours, days or weeks after treatment, including blurred or double vision (if the area around the eyes is injected) and breathing difficulties (if the neck area is injected). What to do if you have problems If you''ve had Botox injections and are not happy with the results or are experiencing problems, take up the matter with your practitioner through the clinic where you were treated. If there are any complications that require medical attention, it is best that you go back to the practitioner who treated you. If this is not possible, you can go to your GP or local accident and emergency (A&E) department. You can also report any side effects directly through the Yellow Card Scheme website.

(364, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/cosmetic-treatments-guide/Pages/Facelift.aspx', 'Facelift', 'Facelift', '', 'A facelift (rhytidectomy) is cosmetic surgery to lift up and pull back the skin to make the face tighter and smoother. The procedure is designed to reduce flabby or sagging skin around the lower half of the face (mainly the jowls) and neck. If you''re thinking of going ahead, be absolutely sure about your reasons for wanting a facelift and don''t rush into it. The procedure can be expensive, the results can''t be guaranteed, and there are risks to consider. It''s a good idea to discuss your plans with your GP first. You can also read Is cosmetic surgery right for me?. Read on to find out: How much does it cost?  Where do I go?  What does it involve?  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems  More information  How much does it cost? In the UK, the cost of a facelift can vary greatly from clinic to clinic and depending on the extent of the procedure.  Expect to pay anything from a few thousand pounds for a mini facelift to £10,000 for a face and neck lift. You should also take into account the cost of any consultations or follow-up care that may be needed. Where do I go? If you''re looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for treatment centres that can perform facelifts.  All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC. The CQC publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. Also, research the surgeon who is going to carry out the facelift. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor''s fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many facelifts they''ve performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? A facelift is usually carried out under general anaesthetic. It may sometimes be performed using a local anaesthetic and sedation. There are many different kinds of facelift, but generally the surgeon will: make cuts (incisions) above the hairline at the temples, which extend down in front of your ear, underneath your earlobe and behind the ear make cuts under the chin if the jawline is also being lifted remove the surplus facial skin pull the remaining skin backwards and upwards before stitching it into its new position sometimes redistribute facial fat and tissue or add this to the face bandage the face to minimise bruising and swelling It usually takes two to three hours, and most people need to stay in hospital overnight. Pain relief is provided if you experience any discomfort afterwards. Recovery It takes about two to four weeks to fully recover from a facelift. You need to take this time off work. Bruising is visible for at least two weeks. It could take up to six to nine months to see the full effect of the facelift. You won''t be able to drive for a number of days after the operation – your surgeon would advise about this. You will have to avoid showering and getting the bandages wet for the first two days, and avoid strenuous activity, saunas and massages for at least two weeks. You also need to keep your head propped up with pillows for a couple of days while resting to reduce the swelling. After about a week: Stitches are removed (unless you had dissolvable stitches). After several weeks: Bruises, scars and redness should have faded. After six to nine months: The full effect of the facelift should be seen. Side effects to expect After a facelift, it''s common to have: a stiff, puffy and numb face for a few weeks or months temporary bruising of the cheeks – the bruises will eventually move down the neck with gravity scars – these fade, but won''t completely disappear a raised hairline or sideburn What could go wrong A facelift can occasionally result in problems, including: a collection of blood underneath the skin (haematoma) nerve injury and loss of sensation or movement in the face asymmetrical facial features – including the position of the earlobe  hair loss or a small but permanent reduction in hair growth around the scars thick, obvious scars developing Any type of operation also carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding developing a blood clot in a vein infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, patients find the desired effect wasn''t achieved and feel they need another operation. You should check how this would be funded with your surgeon. What to do if you have problems  Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms. If you are not happy with the results of your facelift, or you think the procedure wasn''t carried out properly, you should take up the matter with your surgeon through the hospital or clinic where you were treated. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC).

(365, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/female-sterilisation.aspx', 'Female sterilisation', 'Female sterilisation - Contraception guide - NHS Choices', '', 'A woman can get pregnant if a man’s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is female sterilisation. At a glance: female sterilisation   How it works   Who can have it done   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks of female sterilisation   Where you can get it Female sterilisation is usually carried out under general anaesthetic, but can be carried out under local anaesthetic, depending on the method used. The surgery involves blocking or sealing the fallopian tubes, which link the ovaries to the womb (uterus).  This prevents the woman’s eggs from reaching sperm and becoming fertilised. Eggs will still be released from the ovaries as normal, but they will be absorbed naturally into the woman''s body.   At a glance: facts about female sterilisation In most cases, female sterilisation is more than 99% effective, and only one woman in 200 will become pregnant in her lifetime after having it done.  You don''t have to think about it every day, or every time you have sex, so it doesn''t interrupt or affect your sex life.  Sterilisation can be carried out at any stage of the menstrual cycle. It won''t affect hormone levels. You''ll still have periods after being sterilised. You will need to use contraception until the operation is done and until your next period or for three months afterwards (depending on the type of sterilisation). As with any surgery, there''s a small risk of complications. These include internal bleeding, infection or damage to other organs.  There''s a small risk that the operation won''t work. Blocked tubes can rejoin immediately or years later.  If the operation fails, this may increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy (when a fertilised egg implants outside the womb, usually in a fallopian tube).  The sterilisation operation is difficult to reverse. Female sterilisation doesn''t protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so always use a condom to protect yourself and your partner against them. How female sterilisation works Female sterilisation works by preventing eggs from travelling down the fallopian tubes. This means a woman''s eggs cannot meet sperm, and fertilisation cannot happen. How female sterilisation is carried out  Before the operation Recovering after the operation How female sterilisation is carried out There are two main types of female sterilisation: when your fallopian tubes are blocked – for example, with clips or rings (tubal occlusion)   when implants are used to block your fallopian tubes (hysteroscopic sterilisation, or HS)  It can be a fairly minor operation, with many women returning home the same day. Sterilisation is usually carried out using tubal occlusion. Tubal occlusion First, your surgeon will need to access and examine your fallopian tubes, using either laparoscopy or mini-laparotomy. A laparoscopy is the most common method of accessing the fallopian tubes. The surgeon makes a small cut in your abdominal wall near your belly button and inserts a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a small flexible tube that contains a tiny light and camera. The camera relays images of the inside of your body to a television monitor. This allows the surgeon to see your fallopian tubes clearly. A mini-laparotomy involves a small incision, usually less than 5cm (2 inches), just above the pubic hairline. Your surgeon can then access your fallopian tubes through this incision. A laparoscopy is usually the preferred option because it is faster. However, a mini-laparotomy may be recommended for women who: have had recent abdominal or pelvic surgery are obese (have a body mass index of 30 or over)  have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (a bacterial infection that can affect the womb and fallopian tubes) Blocking the tubes The fallopian tubes can be blocked using one of the following methods: applying clips – plastic or titanium clamps are closed over the fallopian tubes  applying rings – a small loop of the fallopian tube is pulled through a silicone ring, then clamped shut  tying and cutting the tube – this destroys 3-4cm (1-1.5 inches) of the tube Hysteroscopic sterilisation (fallopian implants) You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people''s services Find a clinic near you The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published guidance about hysteroscopic sterilisation. In the UK, the brand name of the hysteroscopic sterilisation technique is Essure. The procedure doesn''t require cuts to be made in your abdomen so general anaesthetic is not required. Though you may be given a painkiller and /or a local anaesthetic. A narrow tube with a telescope at the end, called a hysteroscope, is passed through your vagina and cervix. A guidewire is used to insert a tiny piece of titanium metal (called a microinsert) into the hysteroscope, then into each of your fallopian tubes. This means that the surgeon does not need to cut into your body. The implant causes the fallopian tube to form scar tissue around it, which eventually blocks the tube. You should carry on using contraception until an imaging test has confirmed that your fallopian tubes are blocked. This can be done with one or more of the following:  a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) – a type of X-ray that is taken after a special dye has been injected to show up any blockages in your fallopian tubes  a hysterosalpingo-contrast-sonography (HyCoSy) – a type of ultrasound scan involving injecting dye into your fallopian tubes The manufacturer of Essure now advises that ultrasound scan is an additional option for checking placement of the implants 3 months after the sterilisation procedure. If the coils of the implant are seen to be in the correct position tubal occlusion can be assumed Removing the tubes (salpingectomy) If blocking the fallopian tubes has been unsuccessful, the tubes may be completely removed. Removal of the tubes is called salpingectomy. Before the operation Your GP will strongly recommend counselling before referring you for sterilisation. Ideally, this should be with you and your partner if appropriate and acceptable. If possible, you should both agree to the procedure, but it is not a legal requirement to get your partner’s permission. Counselling will give you a chance to talk about the operation in detail, and talk about any doubts, worries or questions that you might have. Your GP does have the right to refuse to carry out the procedure or refuse to refer you for the procedure if they do not believe that it is in your best interests. If this is the case, you may have to pay to have a sterilisation privately. If you decide to be sterilised, your GP will usually refer you to a specialist for treatment. This will usually be a gynaecologist at your nearest NHS hospital. A gynaecologist is a specialist in the female reproductive system. If you choose to have a sterilisation, you will be asked to use contraception until the day of the operation, and to continue using it:  until your next period if you are having your fallopian tubes blocked (tubal occlusion)   for around three months if you are having fallopian implants (hysteroscopic sterilisation) Sterilisation can be performed at any stage in your menstrual cycle. Before you have the operation, you will be given a pregnancy test to make sure that you are not pregnant. It is vital to know this because once the surgeon blocks your fallopian tubes, there is a high risk that any pregnancy will become ectopic (when the fertilised egg grows outside the womb, usually in the fallopian tubes). An ectopic pregnancy can be life-threatening because it can cause severe internal bleeding. Recovering after the operation Once you have recovered from the anaesthetic, passed urine and had something to eat, you will be allowed home. If you leave hospital within hours of the operation, ask a relative or friend to pick you up, or take a taxi. The healthcare professionals treating you in hospital will tell you what to expect and how to care for yourself after surgery. They may give you a contact number to call if you have any problems or any questions. If you have had a general anaesthetic, do not drive a car for 48 hours afterwards. This is because even if you feel fine, your reaction times and judgement may not be back to normal. How you will feel It is normal to feel unwell and a little uncomfortable for a few days if you have had a general anaesthetic, and you may have to rest for a couple of days. Depending on your general health and your job, you can normally return to work five days after tubal occlusion. However, you should avoid heavy lifting for about a week. You may have some slight vaginal bleeding. Use a sanitary towel rather than a tampon until this has gone. You may also feel some pain, similar to period pain. You may be prescribed painkillers for this. If the pain or bleeding gets worse, seek medical attention. Caring for your wound If you had tubal occlusion to block your fallopian tubes, you will have a wound with stitches where the surgeon made an incision (cut) into your stomach. Some stitches are dissolvable and disappear on their own, and some will need to be removed. If your stitches need removing, you will be given a follow-up appointment for this. If there is a dressing over your wound, you can normally remove this the day after your operation. After this, you will be able to have a bath or shower as normal. Having sex Your sex drive and enjoyment of sex will not be affected. You can have sex as soon as it is comfortable to do so after the operation. If you had tubal occlusion, you will need to use contraception until your first period to protect yourself from pregnancy. If you had hysteroscopic sterilisation, you will need to use another form of contraception for around three months after surgery. After scans have confirmed that the implants are in the correct position, you will no longer need contraception. Sterilisation will not protect you from STIs, so continue to use barrier contraception such as condoms if you are unsure of your partner''s sexual health. Who can have it done? Almost any woman can be sterilised. However, sterilisation should only be considered by women who do not want any more children, or do not want children at all. Once you are sterilised it is very difficult to reverse the process, so it''s important to consider the other options available before making your decision. Sterilisation reversal is not usually available on the NHS. Surgeons are more willing to perform sterilisation when women are over 30 years old and have had children, although some younger women who have never had a baby choose it. Advantages and disadvantages of female sterilisation Advantages female sterilisation can be more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy tubal occlusion (blocking the fallopian tubes) and removal of the tubes (salpingectomy) should be effective immediately – however, doctors strongly recommend that you continue to use contraception until your next period hysteroscopic sterilisation is usually effective after around three months – research collected by NICE found that the fallopian tubes were blocked after three months in 96% of sterilised women Other advantages of female sterilisation are that: there are rarely any long-term effects on your sexual health it will not affect your sex drive it will not affect the spontaneity of sexual intercourse or interfere with sex (as other forms of contraception can) it will not affect your hormone levels Disadvantages female sterilisation does not protect you against STIs, so you should still use a condom if you are unsure about your partner''s sexual health  it is very difficult to reverse a tubal occlusion – this involves removing the blocked part of the fallopian tube and rejoining the ends, and reversal operations are rarely funded by the NHS a 2015 US study found that around 1 in 50 women who had a hysteroscopic sterilisation required further surgery due to complications such as persistent pain  Risks with tubal occlusion, there is a very small risk of complications, including internal bleeding and infection or damage to other organs it is possible for sterilisation to fail – the fallopian tubes can rejoin and make you fertile again, although this is rare (about one in 200 women become pregnant in their lifetime after being sterilised) if you do get pregnant after the operation, there is an increased risk that it will be an ectopic pregnancy (when the fertilised egg grows outside the womb, usually in the fallopian tubes) If you miss a period, take a pregnancy test immediately. If the pregnancy test is positive, you must see your GP so that you can be referred for a scan to check if the pregnancy is inside or outside your womb. With hysteroscopic sterilisation, there is a small risk of pregnancy even after your tubes have been blocked. Research collected by NICE has shown that possible complications after fallopian implants can include: pain after the operation – in one study, nearly eight out of 10 women reported pain afterwards the implants being inserted incorrectly – this affected two out of 100 women   bleeding after the operation – many women had light bleeding after the operation, and nearly a third had bleeding for three days Where to get contraception Most types of contraception are available free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. You can get contraception, and information and advice about contraception, at: most GP surgeries – talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraceptive clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics  sexual health clinics – they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people’s services (call 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic.  Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you''re under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won''t tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you''re given and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They''ll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won''t make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you''re at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.   Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 05/01/2015 Next review due: 05/01/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

What do I need to buy or borrow for my newborn? Media last reviewed: 20/03/2014 Next review due: 20/03/2017 Baby clothes Baby bedding Out and about with your baby Baby clothes Babies grow very quickly. All you need for the first few weeks are enough clothes to make sure your baby will be warm and clean. You''ll probably need: six stretch suits (all-in-ones) for both day and night, or four stretch suits and two nightdresses (nighties) for the night – use socks or bootees with the nightie if it''s cold two cardigans, wool or cotton rather than nylon, and light rather than heavy – several light layers of clothing are best for keeping your baby warm four vests a shawl or blanket to wrap your baby in a wool or cotton hat, mittens, and socks or bootees for going out if the weather is cold – it''s better to choose close-knitted patterns rather than those with a loose knit, so your baby''s fingers and toes won''t get caught a sun hat for going out if it''s hot or the sun is bright Washing your baby''s clothes There''s no evidence that using washing powders with enzymes (bio powders) or fabric conditioners will irritate your baby''s skin. Baby bedding For the first few months, you''ll need a crib, carrycot or Moses basket (a light, portable bassinet). Your baby needs to sleep somewhere that''s safe, warm and not too far from you.  Baby nests are not suitable for your baby to sleep in when you''re not there because of the danger of suffocation. If you are borrowing a crib or a cot, or using one that has been used by another of your children, you should ideally buy a new mattress. If you can''t do this, use the cot mattress you have, as long as it''s firm (not soft), flat, fits the cot with no gaps, is clean, and waterproof. You will need: a firm mattress that fits the cot snugly without leaving spaces round the edges, so your baby cannot trap their head and suffocate  sheets to cover the mattress – you need at least four because they need to be changed often; fitted sheets make life easier but they can be quite expensive, so you could use pieces of old sheet light blankets for warmth Pillows and duvets Don''t use pillows and duvets – they are not safe for babies who are less than a year old because of the risk of suffocation. Duvets can also make your baby too hot. Sheets and layers of blankets tucked in firmly below your baby''s shoulder level or a baby sleeping bag are safe for your baby to sleep in. Cot safety Your baby will spend many hours in a cot, so make sure it''s safe. If you''re buying a new cot, look for the British Standard mark BS EN 716-1. The mattress must fit snugly, with no space for the baby''s head to get stuck. The bars must be smooth, securely fixed, and the distance between each bar should be not less than 25mm (1 inch) and not more than 60mm (2.5 inches), so your baby''s head can''t get trapped. The cot should be sturdy. The moving parts should work smoothly and not allow fingers or clothing to get trapped. Cot bumpers are not recommended as babies can overheat or get tangled in the fastenings. Never leave anything with ties, such as bibs or clothes, in the cot as they might get caught around your baby''s neck. The safest place for your baby to sleep is on their back in a cot in the same room as you for the first six months. For more information on safe sleeping, see Reducing the risk of SIDS. You can also visit the Lullaby Trust website, which has lots of information on safe sleeping. Out and about with your baby Spend some time looking at what''s available for getting around with your baby. Think about what will suit you best before you make a choice, and ask other mums what they''ve found useful. Before buying a pushchair or a pram, check that: the brakes are in good working order the handles are at the right height for pushing the frame is strong enough Baby carriers Baby carriers – also called slings – are attached with straps and your baby is carried in front of you. Most babies like being carried like this because they''re close to you and warm. The back part of the carrier must be high enough to support your baby''s head. Check that buckles and straps are secure. Older babies who can hold up their heads and whose backs are stronger – at about four months – can be carried in carriers that go on your back.  See the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) website for more advice on using baby carriers and slings safely. Pushchairs Pushchairs, also known as strollers and buggies, are only suitable for young babies if they have fully reclining seats, so your baby can lie flat. Wait until your baby can sit by themselves before using another type of pushchair. Choose a light pushchair if you will be lifting it on to trains or buses. Prams Prams give your baby a lot of space to sit and lie comfortably, but they take up a lot of space and are hard to use on public transport. If you have a car, look for a pram that can be dismantled easily. Consider buying a pram harness at the same time, as you may need it to strap your baby securely into the pram. Carrycot on wheels A carrycot is a light, portable cot with handles, similar to but smaller than the body of a pram, and often attachable to a wheeled frame. Your baby can sleep in the carrycot for the first few months, and the cot can be attached to the frame to go out. Three-in-one travel system This is a carrycot and transporter (a set of wheels) that can be converted into a pushchair when your baby outgrows the carrycot. Shopping trays that fit under the pushchair or pram can also be very useful when you''re out. Car seats for babies If you''ve got a car, you must have a baby car seat. Your baby must always go in their seat, including when you bring them home from the hospital. It''s illegal and also very dangerous to carry your baby in your arms in a vehicle. The best way for your baby to travel is in a rear-facing infant car seat on the back seat, or the front passenger seat as long as it is not fitted with an airbag. The car seat is held in place by the adult safety belt. The following advice should help make sure your baby''s car seat is as safe as possible: Make sure the car seat is fitted correctly. It is illegal and extremely dangerous to put a rear-facing infant car seat in the front passenger seat if your car is fitted with an airbag. Ideally, buy a new car seat. If you''re planning to get a secondhand seat, only accept one from a family member or friend so you can be sure it hasn''t been involved in an accident. Don''t buy one from a secondhand shop or through the classified ads. Look for the United Nations ECE Regulation number R44.03 or R44.04, or the new i-size regulation R129, when you buy a car seat. For more advice on choosing and fitting baby car seats safely, go to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) website on child car seats.

(367, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/newborn-blood-spot-test.aspx', 'Blood spot screening', 'Newborn blood spot test - Pregnancy and baby guide - NHS Choices', '', 'Every baby is offered newborn blood spot screening, also known as the heel prick test, ideally when they are five days old. Newborn blood spot screening involves taking a blood sample to find out if your baby has one of nine rare but serious health conditions. Most babies screened won''t have any of these conditions but, for the few who do, the benefits of screening are enormous. Early treatment can improve their health and prevent severe disability, and even death. What does the blood spot test involve? When your baby is five days old, a health professional will prick their heel using a special device and collect four drops of blood on a special card. You can minimise any distress to your baby by cuddling and feeding them, and making sure they are warm and comfortable. Occasionally, the sample may need to be taken when your baby is six, seven or eight days old. Sometimes a second blood spot sample is needed. The reason for this will be explained to you. It doesn''t necessarily mean there is something wrong with your baby. The test doesn''t carry any known risks for your baby. Which conditions is the blood spot test for? The blood spot test screens for the following nine rare but serious conditions. If you, your partner, or a family member already has one of these conditions (or a family history of it), please tell your health professional straight away. Sickle cell disease About 1 in 2,000 babies born in the UK has sickle cell disease. This is a serious inherited blood disease. Sickle cell disease affects haemoglobin, the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body. Babies who have this condition will need specialist care throughout their lives. People with sickle cell disease can have attacks of severe pain and get serious, life-threatening infections. They are usually anaemic because their blood cells have difficulty carrying oxygen. The blood spot screening test means that babies with sickle cell disease can receive early treatment to help them live healthier lives. This may include vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent serious illnesses. Pregnant women are also routinely tested for sickle cell disease early in pregnancy. Read more about sickle cell disease, or download leaflets for parents whose child has sickle cell disease. Cystic fibrosis About 1 in 2,500 babies born in the UK has cystic fibrosis. This inherited condition affects the digestion and lungs. Babies with cystic fibrosis may not gain weight well and frequently have chest infections. Babies with the condition can be treated early with a high-energy diet, medicines, and physiotherapy. Although children with cystic fibrosis may still become very ill, early treatment can help them live longer, healthier lives. Read more about cystic fibrosis, or download a leaflet for parents whose baby has suspected cystic fibrosis. Congenital hypothyroidism About 1 in 3,000 babies born in the UK has congenital hypothyroidism. Babies with congenital hypothyroidism do not have enough of the hormone thyroxine. Without thyroxine, babies do not grow properly and can develop learning disabilities. Babies who have the condition can be treated early with thyroxine tablets, and this allows them to develop normally. See more information about congenital hypothyroidism (CHT). Inherited metabolic diseases It is important to let your health professional know if you have a family history of a metabolic disease (a disease that affects your metabolism). Babies are screened for six inherited metabolic diseases. These are: phenylketonuria (PKU) medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)  isovaleric acidaemia (IVA)  glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1)  homocystinuria (pyridoxine unresponsive) (HCU)  About 1 in 10,000 babies born in the UK has PKU or MCADD. The other conditions are rarer, occurring in 1 in 100,000 to 150,000 babies. Without treatment, babies with inherited metabolic diseases can become suddenly and seriously ill. The diseases all have different symptoms. Depending on which one affects your baby, the condition may be life threatening or cause severe developmental problems. They can all be treated with a carefully managed diet and, in some cases, medicines as well. What are amino acids? Our bodies break down protein foods like meat and fish into amino acids (the building blocks of protein). Any amino acids that aren''t needed are usually broken down and removed from the body. Babies with the inherited metabolic diseases that are screened for are unable to break down one or more amino acids. When levels of these amino acids get very high, they are harmful. Does my baby have to have the blood spot test? It''s not compulsory, but it''s recommended because it could save your baby''s life.  You can choose to have screening for sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis or congenital hypothyroidism individually but you can only choose to have screening for all six inherited metabolic diseases or none at all. If you don''t want your baby to be screened for any of these conditions, discuss it with your midwife. You should be given information about the blood spot test and the diseases it screens for in advance so you can make an informed decision for your baby. If you change your mind, babies can be screened up to the age of 12 months for all the conditions except cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis can only be screened for up to eight weeks of age. If you have any concerns about the tests, speak to your midwife, health visitor, or GP. When will we get the results? You should receive the results either by letter or from a health professional by the time your baby is six to eight weeks old. The results should be recorded in your baby''s personal child health record (red book). It''s important to keep this safe and take it with you to all your baby''s appointments. If you have not received your baby''s results, speak to your health visitor or GP. You will be contacted sooner if your baby screens positive. This means they''re more likely to have one of the conditions tested for. If your baby is thought to have congenital hypothyroidism (CHT) or an inherited metabolic disease, you will be contacted the day the result is available, or the next working day, and given an appointment to see a specialist. If your baby is thought to have cystic fibrosis, you will be contacted before they are four weeks old. If your baby is thought to have sickle cell disease, you will be contacted before they are six weeks old. Screening for cystic fibrosis finds some babies who may be genetic carriers of the condition. These babies may need further testing. Screening for sickle cell disease also finds babies who are carriers of this or other red blood cell diseases. Carriers are healthy, although they can experience problems in situations where their bodies aren''t getting much oxygen – for example, if they are having an anaesthetic. Parents of babies who are found to be carriers should be told by the time they are six to eight weeks old. Read more about what being a carrier means. What do the results mean? Most babies will have a normal result, which means it''s unlikely that they have any of the conditions. A small number of babies will screen positive for one of the conditions. This doesn''t mean they have the condition, but they are more likely to have it. They will be referred to a specialist for further tests. It''s important to know that screening is not 100% certain. A baby with a negative screening result may later turn out to have the disease screened for. This is known as a false negative. Babies with a positive result sometimes turn out not to have the disease – what''s known as a false positive. Occasionally, other medical conditions are picked up by blood spot test screening. For example, babies with beta thalassaemia major (a serious blood disease) will usually be detected. These babies will also need to be referred for early treatment. If your baby''s blood spot test is positive The NHS screening programme has produced leaflets for parents who have been told their baby may have one of the conditions screened for. The leaflets provide information about the condition, further tests your baby may be offered, and what treatment is needed. They also answer parents'' questions, including where to find support. See FAQs on blood spot screening. Find out what happens to your baby''s blood spot card. The Screening Tests for You and Your Baby leaflet contains information about the blood spot screening test and the conditions it screens for. It is available in other languages.

She tested positive for a genetic condition. Her parents Lucy and Chris describe how they were told about the test results, their initial fears, and that thanks to the test Hattie''s condition was recognised early enough to prevent complications.

(369, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-early-diagnosis-benefits.aspx', NULL, 'Benefits of early dementia diagnosis - Dementia guide - NHS Choices', '', 'Dementia is one of the health conditions that people are most frightened of.  You may find it hard to accept that memory problems are affecting your life. If you''re concerned about memory or other problems associated with dementia, it''s normal to be reluctant to seek help and face such a diagnosis. However, there are potential benefits to getting medical advice.  Being diagnosed early can help you get the right treatments and find the best sources of support, as well as making decisions about the future. A dementia diagnosis can help uncertainty It may not be clear why you have problems with your memory or why your behaviour has changed. These problems may be because of dementia, or down to other reasons such as poor sleep, low mood, medications or other medical conditions. This uncertainty can be distressing for both you and your family and friends. While a diagnosis of dementia can be devastating news, an explanation of what the problem is and what can be done about it may help you feel empowered and reduce some of the worry caused by uncertainty. Some people find it helpful to discuss with doctors and nurses how the dementia may affect them or their loved one in the future, and there is advice available on how to stay independent with dementia and live well with dementia.    Getting treatments for dementia Dementia is not a single condition – it refers to difficulties with thinking and memory that may be caused by several different underlying diseases. This is one reason why not everyone with dementia experiences the same problems. Recognising that there is a problem, and discovering the underlying cause of the dementia, is important. This is because it will help guide your choice of treatments and services. An early diagnosis of dementia may also be beneficial because some causes of dementia are treatable and fully or partially reversible, depending on the nature of the problem. Conditions such as some vitamin deficiencies, side effects of medications and certain brain tumours may fall into this category. Alzheimer’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies gradually damage the brain. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor medicines have been shown to benefit in Alzheimer’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. These treatments, such as donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (various brand names), improve symptoms by making the remaining brain cells work a bit harder. Memantine is another medication that can help in Alzheimer’s disease. Although they will not cure your dementia, these medications can make a significant difference to your day-to-day living and functioning. Treating high blood pressure, high cholesterol and poorly controlled diabetes is also important, as is stopping smoking and keeping to a healthy weight. These factors (known as risk factors) all contribute strongly to vascular dementia, and may make Alzheimer’s disease worse. Your GP can assess your risk factors, advise if treatment is needed and monitor you.  Medications for other conditions can be reviewed, in case they are having a negative effect on how well your mind is working. Other support if you have dementia Whether or not there are specific treatments for the cause of the dementia affecting you, having the right diagnosis is important for getting the right advice and support. There is a wide variety of help and information available both for people with dementia and their friends, relatives and carers. This dementia support includes: Information on help available at home or in the community, such as from social services, day centres and respite care, community mental health teams, speech and language therapists, dietitians and occupational therapists. Advice regarding financial affairs and planning for the future. Financial benefits and support (such as Attendance Allowance). Advice about driving (see Staying independent with dementia). Advance care planning and help with setting up a Lasting Power of Attorney if the dementia is progressive. This allows a person to be involved in discussions about their future while they are still able to do so effectively. Information and support groups. There are numerous sources of information and advice that are easier to find if you have a diagnosis (for example, the Alzheimer’s Society and FTD support group). Access to a support group is easier if a diagnosis is clear, because support groups can provide specialist information and links to others in similar situations.  Advice and support for other medical conditions If doctors and nurses are aware that a person has a condition causing dementia, this is also helpful when treating other medical problems. This includes taking extra time to explain things to patients in a way they can understand, setting up safer ways of taking medication (for example, pill organiser boxes that help you remember when to take tablets), and understanding and offering extra support if someone has to come into hospital as an inpatient for another reason. Dementia research and planning of dementia services Getting the right diagnosis is also important for research and understanding more about the causes of dementia. Better recognition of how important and common the causes of dementia are is vital for planning services to provide the help and support people need, both locally and nationally.  Find out more on the Join Dementia Research website.

If you''re feeling very distressed over the size of your breasts or they''re causing physical symptoms such as backache, you may be able to have a breast reduction on the NHS. But if you''re considering a breast reduction operation to change your appearance, rather than for health reasons, you''ll need to pay for it privately. Before you go ahead, you may want to read Is cosmetic surgery right for me?. Read on to find out: How much does it cost?  Where do I go? What does it involve?  Afterwards  Recovery  Side effects to expect  What could go wrong  What to do if you have problems  If you''re planning to have children  More information  How much does it cost? In the UK, breast reduction surgery costs around £6,500, plus the cost of any consultations or follow-up care that may not be included in the price. Where do I go? If you''re looking in England, check the Care Quality Commission (CQC) website for providers that can perform breast reductions.  All independent clinics and hospitals that provide cosmetic surgery in England must be registered with the CQC. The CQC publishes inspection reports and performance ratings to help people choose care. Also, research the surgeon who is going to carry out the operation. All doctors must, as a minimum, be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Check the register to see the doctor''s fitness to practise history. You may also want to find out: how many operations they''ve performed where there have been complications what sort of follow-up you should expect if things go wrong their own patient satisfaction rates Read more about choosing a cosmetic surgeon. What does it involve? Breast reduction surgery is carried out under general anaesthetic. There are several techniques the surgeon could use, but generally the operation involves: moving your nipple to its new position – usually while it''s still attached to the blood supply removing excess fat, glandular tissue and skin from your breasts reshaping the remaining breast tissue Most women are left with a scar around the nipple. With some surgical techniques, the scar will also run down vertically and horizontally across the breast crease (anchor-shaped), or just run down vertically to the breast crease. The operation takes between 90 minutes and 4 hours, depending on the extent of the breast reduction. You usually need to stay in hospital for one or two nights. Afterwards When you wake up after surgery, you will have dressings on your breasts and plastic tubes may be attached to them to drain blood away. After one to two days, any tubes would be removed and you will usually be able to go home. Some women experience pain for a few days, which can be relieved with painkillers. It''s likely your breasts will be swollen and feel tender and lumpy after surgery. Recovery It can take two to six weeks to fully recover from breast reduction surgery. You may need to take a week or two off work and shouldn''t drive for at least a week. The final appearance of your breasts may not be obvious for several weeks or months after the operation. Some surgeons recommend wearing a sports bra 24 hours a day for up to three months after breast surgery. The length of time you need to keep the dressings on depends on how quickly your wounds healed. Stitches are removed after a week or two, unless they are dissolvable. You should avoid stretching, strenuous exercise and heavy lifting for up to six weeks after the operation. You can drive again when it''s no longer painful to wear a seatbelt, which may be several weeks. Side effects to expect It''s typical after breast reduction surgery to have: sore breasts for a few weeks up to three scars – one around the nipple, and sometimes another one vertically from the nipple to the crease below the breast, and sometimes a third scar along the crease below the breast Scars are usually quite red for the first six weeks, but most fade over time and should be invisible under normal clothing, bras and bikini tops. What could go wrong Breast reduction surgery can occasionally result in problems, including: thick, obvious scarring unevenly shaped breasts or nipples wound healing problems  loss of nipple sensation being permanently unable to breastfeed red or lumpy breasts if the fat dies (fat necrosis) excess skin left around the scars, which may need to be surgically removed bleeding inside the breast tissue (haematoma) – this generally occurs within the first 24 hours after the operation Also, any type of operation carries a small risk of: excessive bleeding infection an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic a blood clot forming in the deep veins The surgeon should explain how likely these risks and complications are, and how they would be treated if they occurred. Occasionally, people find the desired effect wasn''t achieved and feel they need another operation. What to do if you have problems Cosmetic surgery can sometimes go wrong and the results may not be what you expected. You should contact the clinic where the operation was carried out as soon as possible if you have severe pain or any unexpected symptoms, such as redness of your breast skin, a burning sensation or unusual swelling. If you have breast reduction surgery and are not happy with the results or think the procedure wasn''t carried out properly, you should take up the matter with your surgeon through the hospital or clinic where you were treated. If you have concerns about your care, you should contact the CQC. If necessary, you can make a complaint about a doctor to the General Medical Council (GMC). For more information, read the Royal College of Surgeon''s advice on What if things go wrong? If you''re planning to have children If you plan to have breast reduction surgery before having children, or more children, bear in mind that breasts can get larger again during pregnancy and this may affect the results of the operation. Also, there''s a chance you wouldn''t be able to breastfeed after the operation.

(371, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/contraceptive-patch.aspx', 'Contraceptive patch', 'The contraceptive patch - Contraception guide - NHS Choices', '', 'A woman can get pregnant if a man’s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart, or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the patch. At a glance: the patch   How it works   Who can use it   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks   Where you can get it  The contraceptive patch is a sticky patch, a bit like a nicotine patch, measuring 5x5cm. It delivers hormones into your body through your skin. In the UK, the patch''s brand name is Evra. It contains the same hormones as the combined pill, and it works in the same way. This means that it prevents ovulation (the release of an egg); it thickens cervical mucus, which makes it more difficult for sperm to travel through the cervix; and it thins the womb lining, making it less likely that a fertilised egg will implant there. At a glance: facts about the patch When used correctly, the patch is more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. Each patch lasts for one week. You change the patch every week for three weeks, then have a week off without a patch. You don''t need to think about it every day, and it''s still effective if you vomit or have diarrhoea. You can wear the patch in the bath, in the swimming pool and while playing sports.   If you have heavy or painful periods, the patch can help. The patch can increase blood pressure, and some women get temporary side effects, such as headaches.   Some women develop a blood clot when using the patch, but this is rare. The patch may protect against ovarian cancer, womb cancer and colon cancer. The patch may not be suitable for women who smoke and who are 35 or over, or who weigh 90kg (14 stone) or more. The patch does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so using a condom as well will help to protect you against STIs. How it works How you use the patch  When the patch starts to work What to do if the patch falls off What to do if you forget to take the patch off  Bleeding in the patch-free week  How you use the patch You can use the contraceptive patch on most areas of your body, as long as the skin is clean, dry and not very hairy.  You apply a new patch once a week (every seven days) for three weeks, and then stop using the patch for seven days. This is known as your patch-free week. During your patch-free week you will get a withdrawal bleed, like a period, although this may not always happen. After seven patch-free days, you apply a new patch and start the four-week cycle again. Start your new cycle even if you are still bleeding. You should not stick the patch on: sore or irritated skin  anywhere it may get rubbed off by tight clothing  your breasts When you first start using the patch, you can vary the position every time you use a new patch to reduce your risk of irritation. When the patch starts to work The licence for the patch states that if you start using the patch on the first day of your period, it starts working straight away. This means you can have sex without getting pregnant. The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare guidance states that if you start using the patch in the first five days of your menstrual cycle, you will be protected and won''t need to use additional contraception. If you start using it on any other day, you need to use an additional form of contraception, such as condoms, for the first seven days. You can talk to your doctor or nurse for more information about when the patch will start to work, and whether you need to use additional contraception. What to do if the patch falls off The contraceptive patch is very sticky and should stay on. It should not come off after a shower, bath, hot tub, sauna or swim, or after exercise. If the patch does fall off, what you need to do depends on how long it has been off, and how many days you had a patch on before it came off. If the patch has been off for less than 48 hours: stick your patch back on as soon as possible (if it is still sticky) if it is not sticky, replace it with a new patch (do not try to hold the old patch in place with a plaster or bandage) continue to use your patch as normal and change your patch on your normal change day If the patch has been off for less than 48 hours before you replace it, you will still be protected against pregnancy as long as the patch was on properly for seven days before the patch came off. If this is the case, you do not need to use additional contraception. If you have had a patch on for six days or less before it falls off, you may not be protected against pregnancy and should use additional contraception, such as condoms, for seven days. If the patch has been off for 48 hours or more, or you''re not sure how long it has been off: apply a new patch as soon as possible and start a new patch cycle (this will now be day one of your new cycle)  use another form of contraception, such as condoms, for the next seven days If you had unprotected sex in the previous few days, you may need emergency contraception. See your GP, nurse or local sexual health (GUM) clinic if you are concerned. What to do if you forget to take the patch off If you forget to take the patch off after week one or two, what you need to do depends on how long you have forgotten it. If it has been on for: Less than 48 hours longer than it should have been (eight or nine days in total) – take off the old patch and put on a new one. Continue to use your patch as normal, changing it on your normal change day. You don’t need to use any additional contraception and you are protected against pregnancy.  48 hours or more longer than it should have been (10 days or more in total) – start a whole new patch cycle by applying a new patch as soon as possible. This is now week one of the patch cycle and you will have a new day of the week as your start day and change day. Use another method of contraception, such as condoms, for the next seven days. Ask your doctor or nurse for advice if you have had sex in the previous few days and were not using a condom, as you may need emergency contraception. If you forget to take the patch off after week three, take the patch off as soon as possible and start your patch-free break. Start a new patch on your usual start day, even if you are bleeding. This means that you will not have a full week of patch-free days. You will be protected against pregnancy and do not need to use any additional contraception. You may or may not bleed on the patch-free days. What to do if you forget to put a patch on after the patch-free week There is no specific research on what happens if the patch-free week is longer than seven days. The patch works in a similar way to the vaginal ring and the combined pill, and advice for extending the patch-free week is based on what is known about the vaginal ring and combined pill. If you forget to put on a patch at the end of the patch-free week, put a new one on as soon as you remember. If you put the patch on 48 hours late or less (so the patch-free interval has been nine days or less), you will still be protected against pregnancy, as long as you wore the patch correctly before the patch-free interval. If you put the patch on more than 48 hours late, so the interval has been 10 days or more, you may not be protected against pregnancy and need to use additional contraception, such as condoms, for seven days. Ask your doctor or nurse for advice if you have had sex in the patch-free interval, as you may need emergency contraception.   Bleeding in the patch-free week Some women do not always have a bleed in their patch-free week. This is nothing to worry about if you have used the patch properly and have not taken any medication that could affect it. See your GP or nurse for advice if you are worried, or do a pregnancy test to check if you are pregnant. If you miss more than two bleeds, get medical advice. Who can use the patch You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people''s services Find a clinic near you The contraceptive patch is not suitable for everyone. If you are thinking of using it, your doctor or nurse will need to ask you about your health and your family’s medical history, to make sure the patch is suitable for you. It is very important to tell them about any illnesses or operations you have had, or medications you are currently taking. Conditions and circumstances that may mean you should not use the patch include:  you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant  you are breastfeeding  you smoke and are 35 or over you are 35 or over and stopped smoking less than a year ago  you are very overweight you take certain medicines, such as some antibiotics, St John’s Wort or medicines used to treat epilepsy, tuberculosis (TB) or HIV You will also not be able to use the patch if you have (or have had) any of the following conditions:  thrombosis (blood clots) in a vein or artery a heart problem or a disease affecting your blood circulatory system (including high blood pressure) migraine with aura (warning signs) breast cancer disease of the liver or gallbladder  diabetes with complications, or diabetes for more than 20 years Advantages and disadvantages of the patch If it is used properly, the contraceptive patch is more than 99% effective in stopping you from getting pregnant. This means that if 100 women use the patch according to the instructions, fewer than one will get pregnant in a year. Other advantages of the patch are: it is very easy to use and does not interrupt sex unlike the combined oral contraceptive pill, you do not have to think about it every day – you only have to remember to change the patch once a week the hormones from the contraceptive patch do not need to be absorbed by the stomach, so it is just as effective even if you vomit or have diarrhoea like the pill, it tends to make your periods more regular, lighter and less painful it can help with premenstrual symptoms it may reduce the risk of ovarian, womb and bowel cancer it may reduce the risk of fibroids, ovarian cysts and non-cancerous breast disease Some women may find that the contraceptive patch has some disadvantages and may wish to use a different form of contraception. Some potential disadvantages of the patch are that: it may be visible it can cause skin irritation, itching and soreness it does not protect you against STIs, so you may need to use condoms as well some women get mild temporary side effects when they first start using the patch, such as headaches, nausea (sickness), breast tenderness and mood changes; these side effects usually settle down after a few months bleeding between periods (breakthrough bleeding) and spotting (very light, irregular bleeding) is common in the first few cycles of using the patch; this is nothing to worry about if you are using the patch properly, and you will still be protected against pregnancy Some medicines can make the patch less effective. If you are prescribed new medicine or are buying an over-the-counter medicine, ask the doctor or pharmacist for advice. You may need to use an extra form of contraception while you are taking the medicine, and for 28 days afterwards. Risks of using the patch There is a very small risk of some serious side effects when you use a hormonal contraceptive, such as the contraceptive patch or combined pill. Blood clots The patch slightly increases your chance of developing a blood clot, which can block a vein (venous thrombosis) or an artery (arterial thrombosis, which may lead to a heart attack or stroke). If you have had a blood clot before, do not use the patch. Your risk of blood clots is higher during the first year of using the patch. Your risk is also higher if: you smoke you are very overweight  you are immobile (unable to move) or use a wheelchair you have severe varicose veins  a close family member had a venous thrombosis before they were 45 years old The risk of arterial thrombosis is greatest if: you smoke you are diabetic you have high blood pressure (hypertension) you are very overweight  you regularly have migraines with aura (warning signs) a close family member had a heart attack or stroke before they were 45 Cancer Current research suggests that people who use hormonal contraception, such as the contraceptive patch, are at a slightly increased risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer compared with people who do not use hormonal contraception. However, further research is needed to provide more definitive evidence. Research also suggests there is a small increase in your risk of developing cervical cancer with the long-term use of oestrogen and progestogen hormonal contraception. For most women, the benefits of the patch outweigh the risks. However, discuss all risks and benefits with your GP or nurse before starting to use the patch. You will not be allowed to use the patch if you are considered to be at a higher risk of serious side effects. Where you can get it Most types of contraception are available for free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. When you first get the contraceptive patch you will be given a three-month supply, to see how you get on with it. If there are no problems, you can be prescribed the patch for six months to a year. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries – talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics  sexual health clinics – they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people’s services (call the Sexual Health Line on 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching by postcode or town. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you''re under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won''t tell your parents (or carer), as long as they believe you fully understand the information you''re given and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They''ll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won''t make you.

The chickenpox vaccine is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule. It is currently only offered on the NHS to people who are in close contact with someone who is particularly vulnerable to chickenpox or its complications. There are two chickenpox vaccines currently available. The brand names of the chickenpox vaccine are VARIVAX and VARILRIX. Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for VARIVAX. Read the patient information leaflet (PIL) for VARILRIX Who is at risk from chickenpox? Chickenpox is a common childhood infection. Usually, it''s mild and complications are rare. Almost all children develop immunity to chickenpox after infection, so most only catch it once. The disease can be more severe in adults. Certain groups of people, however, are at greater risk of serious complications from chickenpox. These include: people who have weakened immune systems through illnesses such as HIV or treatments like chemotherapy pregnant women – chickenpox can be very serious for an unborn baby when a pregnant woman catches the infection. It can cause a range of serious birth defects, as well as severe disease in the baby when it is born. Read more about what to do if you catch or are exposed to chickenpox in pregnancy Who should have the chickenpox vaccine? It is recommended for certain individuals, such as: non-immune healthcare workers people who come into close contact with someone who has a weakened immune system This is to lower the chances of infecting people at risk. For example, if you''re having chemotherapy treatment, it''s advisable that non-immune children close to you are given the chickenpox vaccine. The vaccine would also be recommended if you were about to start work in a radiotherapy department and had not had chickenpox before. Read more about who should have the chickenpox vaccine. How the chickenpox vaccine works The chickenpox vaccine is a live vaccine and contains a small amount of weakened chickenpox-causing virus. The vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies that will help protect against chickenpox. Read more about live vaccines. Read more about chickenpox vaccine side effects. How is the chickenpox vaccine given? The vaccine is given as two separate injections, usually into the upper arm, four to eight weeks apart. How effective is the chickenpox vaccine? It''s been shown that 9 out of 10 children vaccinated with a single dose will develop immunity against chickenpox. Two doses are recommended, as this gives an even better immune response. The vaccination is not quite as effective after childhood. It''s estimated that three-quarters of teenagers and adults who are vaccinated will become immune to chickenpox.

A care home can offer similar kinds of care to what family members provide at home, such as help with washing, dressing and providing meals. Care homes for older people are divided into those that offer "personal care" and those that offer "nursing care". A care home that offers personal care will ensure residents'' basic personal needs – such as meals, bathing, going to the toilet and medication – are taken care of. In some homes, more able residents have greater independence and take care of many of their own needs. Choosing a dementia care home In most cases, the first step towards choosing a care home for someone with dementia will be to get an assessment from the local authority social services. This will make clear whether or not they need a place in residential care and what other options might be available. Social services will be able to provide information about residential care homes and may be able to assist with finding a suitable home. Even if the person with dementia is unlikely to be eligible for financial help with residential care home fees, it could still be worth involving social services. The information social services can give you, along with the assessment, is likely to help in making vital long-term decisions about care. You may also want to consider: The location of a care home – this will be more relevant for some people than others. Would the person you''re looking after prefer to be near family and friends? Are there shops, leisure or educational facilities in the area? Is the area noisy? Use the NHS directory to find care homes near you. Is the care home you''re looking at focused on the individual needs of residents, and will they provide for those needs? Or do they insist residents adapt to a particular routine? What contact with the community does the care home have? What arrangements are there for visitors? Can residents come and go as they please, as far as it is safe to do so? Are staff able to help residents go out? Are outings arranged? What involvement would you have in the care home? How would you communicate with staff? Are there any support groups or regular meetings? If safety and security are issues for the person you care for, what arrangements for supervision can the care home provide? Will the care home meet specific religious, ethnic or cultural needs? Will the correct diet be provided? Will the person''s language be spoken? Will there be opportunities to participate in religious activities? Care home inspection reports Care homes for adults are regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). If you are considering a particular residential care home, check the most recent inspection report on the CQC website to see how well the care home is doing and if there is anything of concern. As well as talking to social services, you can talk to your GP, district nurse, palliative care team or consultant to find out what is available in your area. Voluntary organisations such as Independent Age, Age UK or Mind may also be useful. When considering a care home, you should ask if it is accredited by the NHS end of life Gold Standards Framework, which means the home has specially trained staff and good links with local GPs. Your care may involve the local hospital''s palliative care team, the local hospice team, your GP, community nurses and district nurses. If you are relying on local authority funding, you will not be able to be cared for in a home that costs more than the authority is prepared to pay for, unless you or your family can pay the difference. Whether you choose to receive care at home, in a care home or in a hospice, you should be assessed for NHS continuing healthcare. Continuing healthcare is professional care given to meet the physical or mental health needs of adults with a disability, injury or illness over an extended period of time. It means a package of care is arranged and funded by the NHS and is free of charge to the person receiving the care. This is sometimes called fully funded NHS care.

As you get older, you may find that memory loss becomes a problem. It''s normal for your memory to be affected by age, stress, tiredness, or certain illnesses and medications. This can be annoying if it happens occasionally, but if it''s affecting your daily life or is worrying you or someone you know, you should seek help from your GP. How common is dementia? According to the Alzheimer''s Society there are around 800,000 people in the UK with dementia. One in three people over 65 will develop dementia, and two-thirds of people with dementia are women. The number of people with dementia is increasing because people are living longer. It is estimated that by 2021, the number of people with dementia in the UK will have increased to around 1 million. What is dementia? Dementia is a common condition. Your risk of developing dementia increases as you get older, and the condition usually occurs in people over the age of 65. Dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) associated with an ongoing decline of the brain and its abilities. This includes problems with: memory loss thinking speed mental agility language understanding judgement People with dementia can become apathetic or uninterested in their usual activities, and have problems controlling their emotions. They may also find social situations challenging, lose interest in socialising, and aspects of their personality may change. A person with dementia may lose empathy (understanding and compassion), they may see or hear things that other people do not (hallucinations), or they may make false claims or statements.  As dementia affects a person''s mental abilities, they may find planning and organising difficult. Maintaining their independence may also become a problem. A person with dementia will therefore usually need help from friends or relatives, including help with decision making. Your GP will discuss the possible causes of memory loss with you, including dementia. Other symptoms can include: increasing difficulties with tasks and activities that require concentration and planning depression changes in personality and mood periods of mental confusion difficulty finding the right words Most types of dementia can''t be cured, but if it is detected early there are ways you can slow it down and maintain mental function. Read more about the symptoms of dementia. Why is it important to get a diagnosis? An early diagnosis can help people with dementia get the right treatment and support, and help those close to them to prepare and plan for the future. With treatment and support, many people are able to lead active, fulfilled lives.

That way issues like sore nipples or breast engorgement can be sorted out early. Here are some of the problems breastfeeding mums sometimes have, plus tips on how to tackle them. Sore or cracked nipples Not enough breast milk Breast engorgement Baby is not latching on properly Too much breast milk Breastfeeding and thrush Blocked milk duct Mastitis Breast abscess Breastfeeding and tongue tie Sore or cracked nipples Sore nipples are most common about three to seven days into breastfeeding. It usually happens because your baby isn''t well positioned and attached at the breast. Putting up with it could make pain or discomfort worse, so it''s important to get help from your midwife, health visitor or breastfeeding specialist as soon as you can.

It can take a little while before you feel confident that your baby is getting what they need. Learn the signs that your baby is getting enough milk. Offering your baby both breasts at each feed and alternating which breast you start with will help to stimulate your milk supply. So will keeping your baby close and holding them skin to skin. See more ways to boost your breast milk supply. Breast engorgement Breast engorgement is when your breasts get too full of milk. They may feel hard, tight and painful. Engorgement can happen in the early days when you and your baby are still getting used to breastfeeding. It can take a few days for your milk supply to match your baby''s needs. Engorgement can also happen when your baby is older and not feeding so frequently, perhaps when they start having solid foods.  See how to manage breast engorgement. Baby is not latching on properly Breastfeeding is a skill that you and your baby need to learn together. It may take you both a while to get the hang of it. If you are finding breastfeeding painful or your baby doesn''t seem to be satisfied after feeds, they may not be latching onto the breast properly. Find out how to latch your baby on.

If you suspect you or your baby has a thrush infection, see your health visitor or GP. See how to spot the signs of thrush while breastfeeding. Blocked milk duct If breast engorgement continues, it can lead to a blocked milk duct. You may feel a small, tender lump in your breast. Frequent feeding from the affected breast may help. If possible, position your baby with their chin pointing towards the lump so they can feed from that part of the breast. See more help for blocked milk ducts. Mastitis Mastitis (inflammation of the breast) happens when a blocked milk duct isn''t relieved. It makes the breast feel hot and painful, and can make you feel very unwell with flu-like symptoms. It''s important to carry on breastfeeding. Starting feeds with the tender breast may help. See more self-help tips for mastitis. If you are no better within 12-24 hours, or if you feel worse, contact your GP or out-of-hours service as you may need antibiotics. Breast abscess If mastitis is not treated, or if it doesn''t respond to treatment, it can lead to a breast abscess, which may need an operation to drain it. Read more about breast abscesses. Breastfeeding and tongue tie In about 4-11% of babies, the strip of skin that attaches the tongue to the floor of the mouth (frenulum) is shorter than usual. This is known as tongue tie. Some babies who have a tongue tie don''t seem to be bothered by it. In others, it can stop the tongue moving freely, which can make it harder for them to breastfeed.

Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you''re depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They''re wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression isn''t a sign of weakness or something you can "snap out of" by "pulling yourself together". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. How to tell if you have depression Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety. There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, unhappiness or anxiety during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. Read more about low mood and depression. If you''ve been feeling low for more than a few days, take this short test to find out if you''re depressed. When to see a doctor It''s important to seek help from your GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it''s best not to delay.

Sometimes there''s a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or even having a baby, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Read more about the causes of depression. Depression is fairly common, affecting about one in 10 people at some point during their life. It affects men and women, young and old. Studies have shown that about 4% of children aged five to 16 in the UK are anxious or depressed. Treating depression Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medication. Your recommended treatment will be based on whether you have mild, moderate or severe depression. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as "watchful waiting". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and self-help groups. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), are often used for mild depression that isn''t improving or moderate depression. Antidepressants are also sometimes prescribed. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medication. Read more about treating depression. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of the treatments for depression. Living with depression Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise, cutting down on alcohol, giving up smoking and eating healthily. Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed.

On this page you can read about: symptoms of Alzheimer''s disease symptoms of vascular dementia symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies symptoms of frontotemporal dementia symptoms of advanced dementia Symptoms specific to Alzheimer''s disease The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer''s disease. Common symptoms of Alzheimer''s disease and other forms of dementia include: memory loss – especially problems with memory for recent events, such as forgetting messages, remembering routes or names, and asking questions repetitively increasing difficulties with tasks and activities that require organisation and planning becoming confused in unfamiliar environments difficulty finding the right words difficulty with numbers and/or handling money in shops changes in personality and mood depression Early symptoms of dementia (sometimes called cognitive impairment) are often mild and may get worse only very gradually. This means you might not notice if you have them, and family and friends may not notice them or take them seriously for some time. In dementia, the brain becomes more damaged and works less well over time. The symptoms of dementia tend to change and become more severe. For this reason, it''s important to talk to your GP sooner rather than later if you are worried about memory problems. The speed at which symptoms get worse, and the way that symptoms develop, depends on what''s causing the dementia, as well as overall health. This means that the symptoms and experience of dementia can vary greatly from person to person. Some people may also have more than one condition – for example, they may have Alzheimer''s disease and vascular dementia at the same time. While dementia has many symptoms that are similar whatever the cause, the different forms of dementia do have some particular symptoms. Symptoms specific to vascular dementia The symptoms of vascular dementia can sometimes develop suddenly and quickly get worse, although they can also develop gradually over many months or years. People with vascular dementia may also experience stroke-like symptoms, including muscle weakness or paralysis on one side of their body. Read more about vascular dementia. Symptoms specific to dementia with Lewy bodies Dementia with Lewy bodies has many of the symptoms of Alzheimer''s disease and people with the condition typically also experience: periods of being alert or drowsy, or fluctuating levels of confusion  visual hallucinations becoming slower in their physical movements Read more about dementia with Lewy bodies. Symptoms specific to frontotemporal dementia Early symptoms of frontotemporal dementia typically include changes in emotion, personality and behaviour. For example, someone with this type of dementia may become less sensitive to other people’s emotions, perhaps making them seem cold and unfeeling. They may also lose some of their inhibitions, leading to behaviour that is out of character, such as making tactless or inappropriate comments. Some people with frontotemporal dementia also have language problems. This may include not speaking, speaking less than usual or having problems finding the right words. Read more about frontotemporal dementia. Symptoms in the later stages of dementia As dementia progresses, memory loss and difficulties with communication often become very severe. In the later stages, the person is likely to neglect their own health and require constant care and attention. Memory symptoms in later dementia People with advanced dementia may not recognise close family and friends, they may not remember where they live or know where they are. They may find it impossible to understand simple pieces of information, carry out basic tasks or follow instructions. Communication problems in later dementia It''s common for people with dementia to have increasing difficulty speaking and they may eventually lose the ability to speak altogether. It''s important to keep trying to communicate with them and to recognise and use other, non-verbal means of communication, such as expression, touch and gestures. Read more about communication problems in dementia. Problems with mobility in later dementia Many people with dementia gradually become less able to move about unaided and may appear increasingly clumsy when carrying out everyday tasks. Some people may eventually be unable to walk and may become bedbound. Read more about mobility problems in dementia. Incontinence in later dementia Bladder incontinence is common in the later stages of dementia and some people will also experience bowel incontinence. Eating, appetite and weight loss in later dementia Loss of appetite and weight loss are common in the later stages of dementia. It''s important that people with dementia get help at mealtimes to ensure they eat enough. Many people have trouble eating or swallowing and this can lead to choking, chest infections and other problems.   Read more about eating and nutrition.

It contains artificial versions of the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which women produce naturally in their ovaries. At a glance: the combined pill   How the combined pill works   What to do if you miss a pill   Who can use the combined pill   Advantages and disadvantages   Risks of the combined pill A woman can get pregnant if a man’s sperm reaches one of her eggs (ova). Contraception tries to stop this happening by keeping the egg and sperm apart or by stopping egg production. One method of contraception is the combined pill. The hormones in the pill prevent your ovaries from releasing an egg (ovulating). They also make it difficult for sperm to reach an egg, or for an egg to implant itself in the lining of the womb. The pill is usually taken to prevent pregnancy, but can also be used to treat painful periods, heavy periods, premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and endometriosis. At a glance: the combined pill When taken correctly, the pill is over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. This means that fewer than one woman in 100 who use the combined pill as contraception will get pregnant in one year. You need to take the pill every day for 21 days, then stop for seven days, and during this week you have a period-type bleed. You start taking the pill again after seven days. You need to take the pill at the same time every day. You could get pregnant if you don''t do this, or if you miss a pill, or vomit or have severe diarrhoea. If you have heavy periods or painful periods, the combined pill can help. Minor side effects include mood swings, breast tenderness and headaches. There is no evidence that the pill makes women gain weight. There''s a very low risk of serious side effects, such as blood clots and cervical cancer. The combined pill is not suitable for women over 35 who smoke, or women with certain medical conditions. The pill does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so using a condom as well will help to protect you against STIs.

It also: thickens the mucus in the neck of the womb, so it is harder for sperm to penetrate the womb and reach an egg thins the lining of the womb, so there is less chance of a fertilised egg implanting into the womb and being able to grow Although there are many different brands of pill, there are three main types: Monophasic 21-day pills This is the most common type. Each pill has the same amount of hormone in it. One pill is taken each day for 21 days and then no pills are taken for the next seven days. Microgynon, Brevinor and Cilest are examples of this type of pill. Phasic 21-day pills Phasic pills contain two or three sections of different coloured pills in a pack. Each section contains a different amount of hormones. One pill is taken each day for 21 days and then no pills are taken for the next seven days. Phasic pills need to be taken in the right order. Binovum and Logynon are examples of this type of pill. Every day (ED) pills You can get contraception at: most GP surgeries community contraception clinics some GUM clinics sexual health clinics some young people''s services Find a clinic near you There are 21 active pills and seven inactive (dummy) pills in a pack. The two types of pill look different. One pill is taken each day for 28 days with no break between packets of pills. Every day pills need to be taken in the right order. Microgynon ED and Logynon ED are examples of this type of pill. Follow the instructions that come with your packet. If you have any questions about how to take the pill, ask your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist. It''s important to take the pills as instructed, because missing pills or taking them at the same time as certain medicines may make them less effective. How to take 21-day pills Take your first pill from the packet marked with the correct day of the week, or the first pill of the first colour (phasic pills). Continue to take a pill at the same time each day until the pack is finished.  Stop taking pills for seven days (during these seven days you will get a bleed).  Start your next pack of pills on the eighth day, whether you are still bleeding or not. This should be the same day of the week as when you took your first pill. How to take every day pills Take the first pill from the section of the packet marked "start". This will be an active pill. Continue to take a pill every day, in the correct order and preferably at the same time each day, until the pack is finished (28 days).  During the seven days of taking the inactive pills, you will get a bleed. Start your next pack of pills after you have finished the first, whether you are still bleeding or not. Starting the combined pill Most women can start the pill at any time in their menstrual cycle. There is special guidance if you have just had a baby, abortion or miscarriage. You may need to use additional contraception during your first days on the pill – this depends on when in your menstrual cycle you start taking it. If you start the combined pill on the first day of your period (day one of your menstrual cycle) you will be protected from pregnancy straight away. You will not need additional contraception. If you start the pill on the fifth day of your period or before, you will still be protected from pregnancy straight away, unless you have a short menstrual cycle (your period is every 23 days or less). If you have a short menstrual cycle, you will need additional contraception, such as condoms, until you have taken the pill for seven days. If you start the pill on any other day of your cycle, you will not be protected from pregnancy straight away and will need additional contraception until you have taken the pill for seven days. Taking pill packs back-to-back For monophasic combined pills (pills all the same colour and with the same level of hormones), it is normally fine to start a new pack of pills straight after your last one – for example, if you want to delay your period for a holiday. However, avoid taking more than two packs together unless advised to by a doctor or nurse. This is because you may have breakthrough bleeding as the womb lining sheds slightly. Some women find they feel bloated if they run several packs of the pill together. What to do if you miss a pill If you miss a pill or pills, or you start a pack late, this can make the pill less effective at preventing pregnancy. The chance of getting pregnant after missing a pill or pills depends on: when the pills are missed how many pills are missed A pill is late when you have forgotten to take it at your usual time. You have missed a pill when it is more than 24 hours since the time you should have taken it. Missing one pill anywhere in your pack or starting the new pack one day late isn’t a problem, as you will still be protected against pregnancy (known as having contraceptive cover). However, missing two or more pills, or starting the pack two or more days late (more than 48 hours late) may affect your contraceptive cover. In particular, if you make the seven-day pill-free break longer by forgetting two or more pills, your ovaries might release an egg and there is a risk of getting pregnant. This is because your ovaries are not getting any effect from the pill during the seven-day break. If you miss a pill, follow the advice below. If you are not sure what to do, continue to take your pill and use another method of contraception, such as condoms, and seek advice as soon as possible. If you have missed one pill, anywhere in the pack: take the last pill you missed now, even if it means taking two pills in one day continue taking the rest of the pack as usual you don’t need to use additional contraception, such as condoms take your seven-day pill-free break as normal If you have missed two or more pills (you are taking your pill more than 48 hours late) anywhere in the pack: take the last pill you missed now, even if it means taking two pills in one day leave any earlier missed pills continue taking the rest of the pack as usual and use an extra method of contraception for the next seven days you may need emergency contraception you may need to start the next pack of pills without a break (see Starting the next pack after missing two or more pills) You may need emergency contraception if you have had unprotected sex in the previous seven days and have missed two or more pills (you are taking your pill more than 48 hours late) in the first week of a pack. Get advice from your contraception clinic, doctor or pharmacist about this. You can also call NHS 111 or the Sexual Health Line on 0300 123 7123. Starting the next pack after missing two or more pills If there are seven or more pills left in the pack after the last missed pill: finish the pack have the usual seven-day break If there are fewer than seven pills left in the pack after the last missed pill:  finish the pack and start the new one the next day, without having a break Vomiting and diarrhoea If you vomit within two hours of taking the combined pill, it may not have been fully absorbed into your bloodstream. Take another pill straight away and the next pill at your usual time. If you continue to be sick, keep using another form of contraception while you''re ill and for two days after recovering. Very severe diarrhoea (six to eight watery stools in 24 hours) may also mean that the pill doesn''t work properly. Keep taking your pill as normal, but use additional contraception, such as condoms, while you have diarrhoea and for two days after recovering. Speak to your GP or contraception nurse or call NHS 111 for more information, or if your sickness or diarrhoea continues. Who can use the combined pill If there are no medical reasons why you cannot take the pill and you do not smoke, you can take the pill until your menopause. However, the pill is not suitable for all women. To find out whether the pill is right for you, talk to your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist. You should not take the pill if you: are pregnant smoke and are 35 or older stopped smoking less than a year ago and are 35 or older are very overweight take certain medicines (ask your GP about this) You should also not take the pill if you have (or have had): thrombosis (a blood clot) a heart abnormality or heart disease, including high blood pressure severe migraines, especially with aura (warning symptoms) breast cancer disease of the gallbladder or liver diabetes with complications or diabetes for the past 20 years After having a baby If you have just had a baby and are not breastfeeding, you can start the pill on day 21 after the birth. You will be protected against pregnancy straight away. If you start the pill later than 21 days after giving birth, you will need additional contraception (such as condoms) for the next seven days. If you are breastfeeding a baby less than six months old, taking the pill can reduce your flow of milk. It is recommended that you use a different method of contraception until you stop breastfeeding. After a miscarriage or abortion If you have had a miscarriage or abortion, you can start the pill up to five days after this and you will be protected from pregnancy straight away. If you start the pill more than five days after the miscarriage or abortion, you''ll need to use additional contraception until you have taken the pill for seven days. Advantages and disadvantages Some advantages of the pill include: it does not interrupt sex it usually makes your bleeds regular, lighter and less painful it reduces your risk of cancer of the ovaries, womb and colon it can reduce symptoms of PMS it can sometimes reduce acne it may protect against pelvic inflammatory disease it may reduce the risk of fibroids, ovarian cysts and non-cancerous breast disease Some disadvantages of the pill include: it can cause temporary side effects at first, such as headaches, nausea, breast tenderness and mood swings – if these do not go after a few months, it may help to change to a different pill it can increase your blood pressure it does not protect you against sexually transmitted infections breakthrough bleeding and spotting is common in the first few months of using the pill it has been linked to an increased risk of some serious health conditions, such as thrombosis (blood clots) and breast cancer The combined pill with other medicines Some medicines interact with the combined pill and it doesn''t work properly. Some interactions are listed on this page, but it is not a complete list. If you want to check your medicines are safe to take with the combined pill, you can: ask your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine Antibiotics The antibiotics rifampicin and rifabutin (which can be used to treat illnesses including tuberculosis and meningitis) can reduce the effectiveness of the combined pill. Other antibiotics do not have this effect. If you are prescribed rifampicin or rifabutin, you may need additional contraception (such as condoms) while taking the antibiotic. Speak to your doctor or nurse for advice. Epilepsy and HIV medicines, and St John''s wort The combined pill can interact with medicines called enzyme inducers. These speed up the breakdown of progestogen by your liver, reducing the effectiveness of the pill. Examples of enzyme inducers are: the epilepsy drugs carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone and topiramate St John''s wort (a herbal remedy) antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV (research suggests that interactions between these medicines and the progestogen-only pill can affect the safety and effectiveness of both) Your GP or nurse may advise you to use an alternative or additional form of contraception while taking any of these medicines. Risks of taking the combined pill There are some risks associated with using the combined contraceptive pill. However, these risks are small and, for most women, the benefits of the pill outweigh the risks. Blood clots The oestrogen in the pill may cause your blood to clot more readily. If a blood clot develops, it could cause deep vein thrombosis (clot in your leg), pulmonary embolus (clot in your lung), stroke or heart attack. The risk of getting a blood clot is very small, but your doctor will check if you have certain risk factors that make you more vulnerable before prescribing the pill. The pill can be taken with caution if you have one of the risk factors below, but you should not take it if you have two or more risk factors. These include: being 35 years old or over being a smoker or having quit smoking in the past year being very overweight (in women with a BMI of 35 or over, the risks of using the pill usually outweigh the benefits) having migraines (you should not take the pill if you have severe or regular migraine attacks, especially if you get aura or a warning sign before an attack) having high blood pressure having had a blood clot or stroke in the past having a close relative who had a blood clot when they were younger than 45 being immobile for a long time – for example, in a wheelchair or with a leg in plaster Cancer Research is ongoing into the link between breast cancer and the pill. Research suggests that users of all types of hormonal contraception have a slightly higher chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer compared with women who do not use them. However, 10 years after you stop taking the pill, your risk of breast cancer goes back to normal. Research has also suggested a link between the pill and the risk of developing cervical cancer and a rare form of liver cancer. However, the pill does offer some protection against developing endometrium (lining of the womb) cancer, ovarian cancer and colon cancer. Where you can get the combined pill Most types of contraception are available for free in the UK. Contraception is free to all women and men through the NHS. Places where you can get contraception include: most GP surgeries – talk to your GP or practice nurse community contraception clinics some genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics sexual health clinics – they also offer contraceptive and STI testing services some young people''s services (call the Sexual Health Line on 0300 123 7123 for more information) Find your nearest sexual health clinic by searching by postcode or town. Contraception services are free and confidential, including for people under the age of 16. If you''re under 16 and want contraception, the doctor, nurse or pharmacist won''t tell your parents (or carer) as long as they believe you fully understand the information you''re given, and your decisions. Doctors and nurses work under strict guidelines when dealing with people under 16. They''ll encourage you to consider telling your parents, but they won''t make you. The only time that a professional might want to tell someone else is if they believe you''re at risk of harm, such as abuse. The risk would need to be serious, and they would usually discuss this with you first.   Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 29/12/2014 Next review due: 29/12/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

(379, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-cure.aspx', NULL, 'Can dementia be cured? - Dementia guide - NHS Choices', '', 'The concept that dementia is a disease rather than an inevitable side effect of ageing (so-called senile dementia) has been around for over 100 years. But after over a century of research, there''s still a lot we don''t know about the condition and if dementia can be cured. Dementia charities have argued, with some justification, that there is a lack of funding for research into dementia compared with research into treatments for other long-term conditions, such as cancer. However, many areas of research may lead to more effective treatments and, possibly, a cure for dementia. Inevitably, such treatments are many years, probably decades, of hard work away. Even without a cure, there is reason to believe that a continuous improvement in the standards of dementia care can be achieved.   Here are some of the current promising areas of dementia research. Gene therapy for dementia Gene therapy is a field of medicine where genetic material is used to try to prevent or cure a disease. While the theory behind gene therapy has been discussed since the 1970s, this is a very new area of research, and there is currently only one licensed treatment available in the UK. In dementia, gene therapy aims to stop brain cells dying, or possibly replace them, but it may be several years before human trials can begin. Dementia vaccine Some researchers are studying what has been termed a dementia vaccine. This would be a medication to "teach" the immune system to recognise the abnormal deposits of protein (such as amyloid plaques) in Alzheimer''s disease that are thought to cause the damage to brain cells. The immune system would then attack these plaques, which may slow the progression of the condition. Researchers are studying several different ways of doing this, ranging from vaccines to infusions of antibodies. Stem cells and dementia Stem cells are "building block" cells. They can develop into many different cell types, including brain cells. Two main avenues of research into the use of stem cells in dementia are being explored. First, stem cells can be manipulated so they mimic some of the body''s processes that may cause the development of dementia. Doing this will help scientists to better understand dementia. It also allows researchers to predict the effects of potential dementia drugs more accurately. Second, researchers hope that one day, stem cells could be used to develop new brain cells to replace the cells that are damaged by dementia. Psychological interventions for dementia These advances in complex technology are important, but there have also been developments in helping people to deal with their psychological symptoms. These include: cognitive stimulation – where people take part in activities and exercises designed to improve their memory, problem-solving skills and language ability validation therapy – where people are encouraged to explore what things were like for the person in the past and how this relates to the way they are feeling now Research into improving these approaches continues, and other new approaches are also being explored. These include social media support groups and memory improvement apps. Another goal of research into psychological interventions is to find ways to help manage challenging behaviour in people with dementia without having to resort to antipsychotic medicines. One method that is providing promising results is known as functional analysis. This is based on the theory that the best way to manage challenging behaviour is to understand the motivation driving it. People with dementia often act in challenging ways because they feel their needs are not met, and that makes them upset. Join dementia research There are dozens of dementia research projects going on around the world; many of these are based in the UK. You may be able to help scientists better understand the disease by taking part in research. This includes studies looking at how our genes, or even our lifestyle, may play a role in our risk of developing dementia.

Dementia will gradually affect the way a person communicates. Their ability to present rational ideas and to reason clearly will change. If you are looking after a person with dementia, you may find that as the illness progresses you''ll have to start discussions to get the person to make conversation. This is common. Their ability to process information gets progressively weaker and their responses can become delayed. Encouraging someone with dementia to communicate Try to start conversations with the person you''re looking after, especially if you notice that they''re starting fewer conversations themselves. Ways to encourage communication include: speaking clearly and slowly, using short sentences making eye contact with the person when they''re talking, asking questions or having other conversations giving them time to respond, because they may feel pressured if you try to speed up their answers encouraging them to join in conversations with others, where possible letting them speak for themselves during discussions about their welfare or health issues, as they may not speak up for themselves in other situations trying not patronise them, or ridiculing what they say acknowledging what they have said, even if they don''t answer your question, or what they say seems out of context – show that you''ve heard them and encourage them to say more about their answer giving them simple choices – avoid creating complicated choices for them using other ways to communicate – such as rephrasing questions because they can''t answer in the way they used to The Alzheimer''s Society has several information sheets that can help, including ones on the progression of dementia and communicating. Communicating through body language and physical contact Communication isn''t just talking. Gestures, movement and facial expressions can all convey meaning or help you get a message across. Body language and physical contact become significant when speech is difficult for a person with dementia. Communicating when someone has difficulty speaking or understanding can be made easier by: being patient and remaining calm, which can help the person communicate more easily keeping your tone of voice positive and friendly, where possible talking to them at a respectful distance to avoid intimidating them – being at the same level or lower than they are – for example, if they are sitting – can also help patting or holding the person''s hand while talking to them can reassure them and make you feel closer – watch their body language and listen to what they say to see whether they''re comfortable with you doing this It''s important that you encourage the person to communicate what they want, however they can. Remember, we all find it frustrating when we can''t communicate effectively, or are misunderstood. Listening to and understanding someone with dementia Communication is a two-way process. As a carer of someone with dementia, you will probably have to learn to "listen" more carefully. You may need to be more aware of non-verbal messages, such as facial expressions and body language. You may have to use more physical contact, such as reassuring pats on the arm, or smile as well as speaking. The following tips may improve communication between you and the person you''re caring for. Active listening When communicating with someone with dementia, "active listening" skills can help. These include: using eye contact to look at the person, and encouraging them to look at you when either of you are talking trying not to interrupt them, even if you think you know what they''re saying stopping what you''re doing so you can give the person your full attention while they speak minimising distractions that may get in the way of communication, such as the television or the radio playing too loudly, but always check if it''s OK to do so repeating what you heard back to the person and asking if it''s accurate, or asking them to repeat what they said "listening" in a different way – shaking your head, turning away or murmuring are alternative ways of saying no or expressing disapproval Page last reviewed: 11/02/2015 Next review due: 11/02/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

It usually affects the back of the nose, the throat or the sinuses (air-filled cavities in the bones of the face). It''s often temporary, but some people experience it for months or years. This is known as chronic catarrh. Catarrh can be a nuisance and may be difficult to get rid of, but it''s not harmful and there are treatments available. This page covers: Symptoms associated with catarrh Treatments for catarrh When to see your GP What causes catarrh? Symptoms associated with catarrh Catarrh can lead to a: constant need to clear your throat feeling that your throat is blocked blocked or stuffy nose that you can''t clear runny nose feeling of mucus running down the back of your throat persistent cough headache or facial pain reduced sense of smell and taste crackling sensation in your ear and some temporary hearing loss These problems can be frustrating to live with and may affect your sleep, making you feel tired. Treatments for catarrh Catarrh will often pass in a few days or weeks as the condition that causes it improves. See What causes catarrh? below for more information. There are things you can try at home to relieve your symptoms, such as: avoiding things that trigger your symptoms, such as allergens or smoky places taking sips of cold water when you feel the need to clear your throat – constantly clearing your throat may make things worse using a saline nasal rinse several times a day – these can be bought from a pharmacy or made at home with half a teaspoon of salt in a pint of boiled water that''s been left to cool avoiding warm, dry atmospheres, such as places with air conditioning and car heating systems – placing plants or bowls of water in a room may help to keep the air humid staying well hydrated talking to a pharmacist about suitable over-the-counter medications – including decongestants, antihistamines or steroid nasal sprays There are also several remedies, such as herbal medicines, available from health shops and pharmacies that claim to treat catarrh. Some people find these helpful, but there''s generally little scientific evidence to suggest they work. When to see your GP Speak to your GP if your catarrh persists and is becoming difficult to live with. They may want to rule out conditions that could be causing it, such as nasal polyps or allergies. This may mean you need to be referred to a specialist for tests. If you''re diagnosed with a specific underlying condition, treating it may help relieve your catarrh. For example, nasal polyps may be treated with a steroid nasal spray, or in some cases surgery.  Read more about treating nasal polyps. If a cause for you catarrh cannot be found, the self-help techniques above may be recommended. Unfortunately, however, chronic catarrh can be hard to treat and may last for a long time. What causes catarrh? Catarrh is usually caused by the immune system reacting to an infection or irritation, which causes the lining of your nose and throat to become swollen and produce mucus. This can be triggered by: a cold or other infections hay fever or other types of allergic rhinitis non-allergic rhinitis nasal polyps It''s unclear what causes chronic catarrh, but it''s not thought to be the result of an allergy or infection. It may be related to an abnormality in the way mucus travels within the nose or an increased sensitivity to mucus in the back of the nose and throat.

(383, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-treatment.aspx', NULL, 'How is dementia treated? - Dementia guide - NHS Choices', '', 'Most types of dementia cannot be cured and will gradually cause more severe problems. But there are important exceptions, including dementia caused by vitamin and thyroid hormone deficiencies, which can be treated with supplements. Some causes can be treated surgically – for example, some brain tumours, excess fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus) or head injury. For types of dementia that involve degeneration of nerve and brain tissue, you can take action to prevent further damage. It''s possible to do this by reducing dementia risk factors, such as by managing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 1 diabetes and stopping smoking. For dementia that currently cannot be cured, some types of medicine may prevent symptoms getting worse for a period of time. These medicines are usually given to people in the early and middle stages of the disease, to try to maintain or improve their independence. It is fairly common for people with dementia to have depression. If you have dementia and depression, your GP may consider prescribing an antidepressant medication, or get you an appointment with a psychiatrist who specialises in working with older people. Perhaps the most important type of treatment for anyone with dementia is the care and support they receive from healthcare professionals, family and friends. If you or a loved one have been diagnosed with dementia, you should start planning the future care that will be required. Discuss the options, such as Power of Attorney, with the people concerned – your family, your GP and your local authority. The Alzheimer’s Society is also a valuable source of information and support. It has branches in England, Ireland and Wales. Finally, there are things you or your loved one can do to maintain memory, independence and function when you have dementia. Medicines to treat dementia A number of medications have been shown to be effective in treating mild, moderate and severe dementia. Depending on the particular type of dementia, the severity of the condition, or any other issues observed by the doctor, you may be prescribed medications. However, not everyone will benefit from these drugs. Aricept (donepezil) and other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (such as galantamine, and rivastigmine) are used to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. They can also be used to treat dementia with Lewy bodies, and can be particularly effective at treating hallucinations. Common side effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors include nausea and vomiting, but these usually get better after two weeks of taking the medication. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can sometimes slow down your heartbeat, so you may need to have an electrocardiogram (ECG) both before and during treatment. An ECG is a procedure that records the rhythms and electrical activity of your heart. Memantine hydrochloride Memantine is a medicine that works by blocking the effects of a chemical in the brain. It is used to treat severe Alzheimer’s disease, but can also be given to people with moderate symptoms if they don''t respond well to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Antipsychotics Antipsychotics are medicines that are sometimes used to treat people who''s behaviour is disruptive – for example, they tend to become aggressive or agitated. They are normally used for a short period of time and with caution, because they can increase the risk of cardiovascular problems, cause drowsiness and tend to make other symptoms of dementia worse. There is some evidence that antipsychotics can cause a range of serious side effects for people who have dementia with Lewy bodies. These include: rigidity immobility inability to communicate In most cases, antipsychotics are only used when there are severe symptoms of challenging and disruptive behaviour that pose harm. Before being given antipsychotic drugs, the benefits and risks of treatment should be fully discussed between health and care professionals, family carers, and, if possible, with the person being prescribed the drugs. If antipsychotics are used, they will be prescribed at the lowest possible dose and for the shortest possible time. The health of anyone taking antipsychotics needs to be carefully monitored. Antidepressants Depression is an issue for many people with dementia, perhaps linked with frustrations caused by the condition. Depression can sometimes make the memory of a person with dementia worse. Antidepressants may be prescribed. Psychological treatments for dementia Psychological treatments do not slow down the progression of dementia, but they can help with the symptoms. Cognitive stimulation and reality orientation therapy Cognitive stimulation involves taking part in activities and exercises designed to improve memory, problem-solving skills and language ability. Reality orientation therapy reduces feelings of mental disorientation, memory loss and confusion, while improving self-esteem. Evidence suggests that cognitive stimulation can improve thinking and memory skills in people with dementia. It is currently the only psychological treatment directly recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to help people with mild or moderate dementia. Reality orientation may also be beneficial in some cases, but the benefits can be small and are often only apparent with continued effort. Validation therapy Validation therapy focuses on dementia from an emotional, rather than factual, perspective. It is based on the principle that even the most confused behaviour has some meaning for the person. For example, if someone with dementia becomes agitated at a certain point every day because they believe their mother is going to come and pick them up, telling them that their mother is no longer alive could cause them to become more agitated and distressed. With validation therapy, the response to this situation might involve not correcting the person and accepting their concerns, but talking to them about the issue and gradually steering the conversation in another direction. In theory, this should reduce their distress, while acknowledging that their thoughts and feelings have meaning for them. However, while validation therapy may sometimes be used as part of the treatment of someone with dementia, there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of this approach to be certain whether it is beneficial. Behavioural therapy Behavioural therapy tries to find reasons for difficult behaviour. Different strategies are adopted to try to change that behaviour. For example, a person with dementia may have a history of wandering out of their home or care centre because they feel restless. Therefore, encouraging them to take part in regular physical exercise may help to decrease their restlessness. Behavioural therapy can be used to treat many of the behavioural problems that are associated with dementia, such as depression, aggression and delusional thinking. Behavioural therapy is often given by a trained friend or relative (usually the main family carer), or by an employed carer, but is supervised by a healthcare professional.

You can find some of the answers you need in Getting to know your newborn. Breastfeeding your new baby In the beginning it can seem like you''re doing nothing but feeding, but gradually you and your baby will get into a pattern and the amount of milk you produce will settle. Feed your baby as often as they want. This is called baby-led feeding. Let your baby decide when they''ve had enough.  Find out more about: Breastfeeding: the first few days Soothing sore or cracked nipples How to tell if your baby is getting enough milk Washing and bathing your new baby You don''t need to bathe your baby in the first few days. You may prefer to wash their face, neck, hands and bottom carefully instead. This is sometimes called "topping and tailing". Choose a time when your baby is awake and content. Make sure the room is warm and get everything ready beforehand. You''ll need a bowl of warm water, a towel, cotton wool, a fresh nappy and, if necessary, clean clothes. See how to ''top and tail'' or bathe your new baby. How to change your baby''s nappy Babies need frequent nappy changes, but how often they need changing depends on how sensitive their skin is.  Some babies have very delicate skin and need changing as soon as they wet themselves, otherwise their skin becomes sore and red. Other babies can wait to be changed until before or after every feed. All babies need changing as soon as possible when they''ve done a poo (stool) to prevent nappy rash. Find out more about: Changing your baby''s nappy  How to prevent nappy rash Soothing a crying baby Crying is your baby''s way of telling you they need comfort and care. But it''s not always easy to work out what they want. Find out why your baby may be crying and how to soothe them.  Helping your baby to sleep It''s normal for new babies to only sleep for two to three hours at a time through the night as well as during the day. One reason is that newborn babies aren''t tuned into day and night yet. Babies also grow quickly in the early months and they have very small stomachs. This means they need to feed little and often. As your baby grows, they''ll gradually start to need fewer night feeds and will sleep for longer at night. See how to get your baby into healthy sleep habits. How to tell if your baby is seriously ill It can be difficult to tell when a baby is seriously ill. Above all, it''s important to trust your instincts. You know your baby better than anyone else, so you''ll know if their appearance or behaviour is worrying. For a checklist of "red alert" symptoms that should always be treated as serious, see Does your child have a serious illness?.  Reducing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) SIDS is rare, so don''t let worrying about it stop you enjoying your baby''s first few months. Putting your baby on their back to sleep, in a cot in the same room as you, for the first six months is one way to reduce your baby''s risk even further.  Not smoking during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and not letting anyone else smoke in the same room as your baby, will also help to protect them.

(387, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/breast-cancer-screening/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Breast cancer screening', 'Breast cancer screening - NHS Choices', 'Breast cancer screening  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  About one in eight women in the UK are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. There''s a good chance of recovery if it''s detected in its early stages. Breast screening aims to find breast cancers early. It uses an X-ray test called a mammogram that can spot cancers when they are too small to see or feel. Breast screening does, however, have some risks you should be aware of (see below). As the likelihood of getting breast cancer increases with age, all women who are aged 50-70 and registered with a GP are automatically invited for breast cancer screening every three years. In the meantime, if you are worried about breast cancer symptoms, such as a lump or area of thickened tissue in a breast, don''t wait to be offered screening – see your GP. This page gives an overview of breast cancer screening, with links to information on why and when it is offered, what happens when you go for breast screening, and receiving your results. Why is breast screening offered? Most experts agree that regular breast screening is beneficial in identifying breast cancer early. The earlier the condition is found, the better the chances of surviving it. You''re also less likely to need a mastectomy (breast removal) or chemotherapy if breast cancer is detected at an early stage. The main risk is that breast screening sometimes picks up cancers that may not have caused any symptoms or become life-threatening. You may end up having unnecessary extra tests and treatment. Read about the pros and cons of breast cancer screening. When will I be offered breast screening? Breast screening is currently offered to women aged 50-70 in England. However, the NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47-73. You will first be invited for screening between your 50th and 53rd birthday, although in some areas you''ll be invited from the age of 47 as part of the trial extension of the programme. You may be eligible for breast screening before the age of 50 if you have a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer (for more information, read ''If you have a family history of breast cancer''). If you''re over the age of 70, you''ll stop receiving screening invitations. However, you''re still eligible for screening and can arrange an appointment by contacting your local screening unit. For more information, read when breast cancer screening is offered. Find breast screening units in your area. What happens during breast screening? Breast screening is carried out at special clinics or mobile breast screening units. The procedure is carried out by female members of staff who take mammograms. During screening, your breasts will be X-rayed one at a time. The breast is placed on the X-ray machine and gently but firmly compressed with a clear plate. Two X-rays are taken of each breast at different angles. For more information, read what happens during breast cancer screening.  When will I receive my results? After your breasts have been X-rayed, the mammogram will be checked for any abnormalities. The results of the mammogram will be sent to you and your GP no later than two weeks after your appointment. Following screening, about one in 25 women will be called back for further assessment. Being called back doesn''t mean you definitely have cancer. The first mammogram may have been unclear. About one in four women who are called back for further assessment are diagnosed with breast cancer. Read our page on understanding your results.

(388, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/controlling-anger.aspx', 'Anger management', 'How to control your anger - Stress, anxiety and depression - NHS Choices', '', 'Anger is a normal, healthy emotion. However, it can be a problem if you find it difficult to keep it under control. "You can control your anger, and you have a responsibility to do so," says clinical psychologist Isabel Clarke, a specialist in anger management. Dealing with anger Managing anger in the long term Let go of angry thoughts Anxiety, fear and anger Domestic violence and anger Getting help with anger Dealing with anger "Everyone has a physical reaction to anger. Be aware of what your body is telling you, and take steps to calm yourself down," says Isabel. Recognise your anger signs Your heart beats faster and you breathe more quickly, preparing you for action. You might also notice other signs, such as tension in your shoulders or clenching your fists. "If you notice these signs, get out of the situation if you’ve got a history of losing control," says Isabel. Count to 10 Counting to 10 gives you time to cool down, so you can think more clearly and overcome the impulse to lash out. Breathe slowly Breathe out for longer than you breathe in, and relax as you breathe out. "You automatically breathe in more than out when you’re feeling angry, and the trick is to breathe out more than in," says Isabel. "This will calm you down effectively and help you think more clearly." Managing anger in the long term Once you can recognise that you’re getting angry, and can calm yourself down, you can start looking at ways to control your anger more generally.  Exercise can help with anger Bring down your general stress levels with exercise and relaxation. Running, walking, swimming, yoga and meditation are just a few activities that can reduce stress. "Exercise as part of your daily life is a good way to get rid of irritation and anger," says Isabel. Looking after yourself may keep you calm Make time to relax regularly, and ensure that you get enough sleep. Drugs and alcohol can make anger problems worse. "They lower inhibitions and, actually, we need inhibitions to stop us acting unacceptably when we’re angry," says Isabel. Get creative Writing, making music, dancing or painting can release tension and reduce feelings of anger. Talk about how you feel Discussing your feelings with a friend can be useful and can help you get a different perspective on the situation. Let go of angry thoughts "Try to let go of any unhelpful ways of thinking," says Isabel. "Thoughts such as ''It’s not fair,'' or ''People like that shouldn’t be on the roads,'' can make anger worse." Thinking like this will keep you focused on whatever it is that’s making you angry. Let these thoughts go and it will be easier to calm down. Try to avoid using phrases that include: always (for example, "You always do that.") never ("You never listen to me.") should or shouldn''t ("You should do what I want," or "You shouldn''t be on the roads.") must or mustn''t ("I must be on time," or "I mustn''t be late.") ought or oughtn''t ("People ought to get out of my way.") not fair Anxiety, fear and anger Sometimes when people talk about "anger" what they actually mean is aggression, says Dr James Woollard, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist. "Often when people experience or appear to show anger, it’s because they are also feeling fear or perceive a threat, and they are responding with a ''fight'' response to this." "Asking yourself, ''What might I be scared of?'' can give you a different set of choices about how to respond," says Dr Woollard. "You might be angry that something has not gone your way. But you may also be scared that you might be blamed or hurt as result. Recognising this might allow you to think and act differently." Read more on how to manage your anxiety. "Managing your anger is as much about managing your happiness and contentment as your anger," adds Dr Woollard. "It should be a part of developing your emotional intelligence and resilience." Domestic violence and anger If uncontrolled anger leads to domestic violence (violence or threatening behaviour within the home), there are places that offer help and support. You can talk to your GP or contact domestic violence organisations such as Refuge, Women''s Aid or the Alternatives to Violence Project. Read about getting help for domestic abuse. Getting help with anger If you feel you need help dealing with your anger, see your GP. There might be local anger management courses or counselling that could help you. There are private courses and therapists who can help with anger issues. Make sure any therapist you see is registered with a professional organisation, such as the British Association for Counselling & Psychotherapy. Anger management programmes A typical anger management programme may involve one-to-one counselling and working in a small group. The programmes can consist of a one-day or weekend course. In some cases, it may be over a couple of months. The structure of the programmes can differ, depending on who is providing it, but most programmes include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), as well as counselling.

(389, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/relationships-and-dementia.aspx', 'Behaviour and personality changes can strain relationships in families of people with dementia', 'Dementia and your relationships - Dementia guide - NHS Choices', '', 'As dementia progresses, your relationships are almost certain to change. It is easy to feel isolated and alone if you or someone you care for has dementia. Keeping in contact with others is good for people with dementia because it can help keep them active and stimulated. Some people find it difficult to talk about their own or a family member''s dementia, or want to help but don''t know how. If a friend or family member finds it hard to talk to you, don''t lose touch. Make the first move – explain that you still need to see them and tell them how they can help you. You may also find it helpful to join a local group of people with dementia and their families. Read more about living well with dementia. If you have dementia yourself, it''s important to tell your family and friends so they understand what is happening. If you find this difficult, you could ask your doctor to discuss your symptoms with your family. This way, as your symptoms progress they may better understand why you may not always remember them. Family, friends and carers of people with dementia As a family member or friend, you may find the person with dementia becomes unable to perform certain tasks or the roles they once did, such as handling bills or general household tasks. So it''s important to start making plans as soon as possible after a dementia diagnosis. We need to communicate to express our needs, likes and dislikes. If making our thoughts known becomes a problem as it does in dementia, it can be very frustrating. Frustration can lead to difficult-seeming behaviour. And if this behaviour helps a person with dementia get what they want, they may repeat it in future. If you''re looking after someone who has dementia, you may have feelings of grief or loss even though the person you''re caring for is still alive. This could happen because dementia is a life-limiting condition (it stops you doing things you would normally do, without reasonable hope of a cure) or perhaps the personality of the person with dementia has been affected by their condition. Although not everyone experiences this "anticipatory grief", people who do can feel the same emotions and sense of mourning as if the person had actually died. Dementia does not necessarily stop you enjoying relationships, or even your sex life. Some couples find they can still be close, even if other abilities have deteriorated. But sometimes dementia can increase or reduce previous sexual feelings, and you or your partner may find this distressing. Relationships, dementia and residential care Going into residential care is a difficult decision for anyone, regardless of the age or level of disability of the person going into care. And although by going into care they enter a protected environment, this doesn''t stop their ordinary human needs. If a person with dementia goes to stay in a care home, they will need to maintain existing relationships, even at a distance. They may develop new relationships with people in their new home. Wanting to continue having a loving relationship with a partner, whether physical or not, will not automatically stop when they get diagnosed with dementia, or even if they have to stay in a care home. Physically intimate sexual relationships may not end when someone with dementia goes into a care home. However, care homes have a duty to protect vulnerable adults, such as those with dementia, and staff will have to balance this with partners'' rights to a fulfilling emotional and sexual life. While it may be hard to talk about, it is something that may need to be discussed with the care home manager. The Alzheimer''s Society has detailed information about dementia and sexual relationships, including adapting to changes in sexual behaviour, capacity to consent to sexual relationships, and what to do in cases of suspected sexual abuse.

But if your child''s anxiety is starting to affect their wellbeing, they may need some help to overcome it. What makes children anxious? When is anxiety a problem for children? What are the signs of anxiety in children? Why is my child anxious? How to help your anxious child Other ways to ease anxiety in children When should we get help? What makes children anxious? Children tend to feel anxious about different things at different ages. Many of these worries are a normal part of growing up. From about eight months to three years, for example, it''s very common for young children to have something called separation anxiety. They may become clingy and cry when separated from their parents or carers. This is a normal stage in children''s development and tends to ease off at around age two to three. It''s also common for pre-school children to develop specific fears or phobias. Common fears in early childhood include animals, insects, storms, heights, water, blood, and the dark. These fears usually go away gradually on their own. Throughout a child''s life there will be other times when they feel anxiety. Lots of children feel anxious when going to a new school, for example, or before tests and exams. Some children feel shy in social situations and may need support with this. When is anxiety a problem for children? Anxiety becomes a problem for children when it starts to get in the way of their day-to-day life. "We all get anxious at times, but some children seem to live a life of anxiety, where it''s not short-term and it''s not just an occasional thing," says Paul Stallard, Professor of Child and Family Mental Health at the University of Bath. "For example, if you go into any school at exam time all the kids will be anxious but some may be so anxious that they don''t get into school that morning," says Professor Stallard. Severe anxiety like this can harm children''s mental and emotional wellbeing, affecting their self-esteem and confidence. They may become withdrawn and go to great lengths to avoid things or situations that make them feel anxious. What are the signs of anxiety in children? When young children feel anxious, they cannot always understand or express what they are feeling. You may notice that they: become irritable, tearful or clingy have difficulty sleeping wake in the night start wetting the bed have bad dreams In older children you may notice that they: lack the confidence to try new things or seem unable to face simple, everyday challenges find it hard to concentrate have problems with sleeping or eating are prone to angry outbursts have negative thoughts going round and round their head, or keep thinking that bad things are going to happen start avoiding everyday activities, such as seeing friends, going out in public or attending school See more about the physical symptoms of anxiety. Why is my child anxious? Some children are more prone to worries and anxiety than others. Children often find change difficult and may become anxious following a house move or when starting a new school. Children who have had a distressing or traumatic experience, such as a car accident or house fire, may suffer with anxiety afterwards. Family arguments and conflict can also leave children feeling insecure and anxious. Teenagers are more likely to suffer with social anxiety than other age groups, avoiding social gatherings or making excuses to get out of them. Read more about social anxiety. How to help your anxious child If a child is experiencing anxiety, there is plenty parents and carers can do to help. First and foremost, it''s important to talk to your child about their anxiety or worries. Reassure them and show them you understand how they feel. If your child is old enough, it may help to explain what anxiety is and the physical effects it has on our bodies. It may be helpful to describe anxiety as being like a wave that builds up and then ebbs away again. As well as talking to your child about their worries and anxieties, it''s important to help them find solutions, says Professor Stallard. "The tendency is to say, if you''re worried about that sleepover, don''t go," he says. "But what you''re doing is saying, if you get anxious about something, it means you can''t do it. "It''s more helpful to say, ''I hear that you''re worried about this. What can you do that''s going to help?''," says Professor Stallard. "Focus on exploring solutions with your child, instead of just talking about all the things that could go wrong." Other ways to ease anxiety in children Teach your child to recognise signs of anxiety in themselves and to ask for help when it strikes. Children of all ages find routines reassuring so try to stick to regular daily routines where possible. If your child is anxious because of distressing events, such as a bereavement or separation, see if you can find books or films that will help them understand their feelings. If you know a change, such as a house move is coming up, prepare your child by talking to them about what is going to happen and why. Try not to become anxious yourself or overprotective – rather than doing things for your child or helping them to avoid anxiety-provoking situations, encourage your child to find ways to manage them. Practice simple relaxation techniques with your child, such as taking three deep, slow breaths, breathing in for a count of three and out for three. You''ll find more relaxation techniques for children on the Moodcafe website. Distraction can be helpful for young children. For example, if they are anxious about going to nursery, play games on the way there, such as seeing who can spot the most red cars. Turn an old tissue box into a "worry" box. Get your child to write down or draw their worries and post them into the box. Then you can sort through the box together at the end of the day or week. When should we get help?   If your child''s anxiety is severe, persists and interferes with their everyday life, it''s a good idea to get some help. A visit to your GP is a good place to start. If your child''s anxiety is affecting their school life, it''s a good idea to talk to their school as well.

Palliative care at home Media last reviewed: 03/05/2016 Next review due: 03/05/2018 People with dementia often live for many years after their diagnosis. The symptoms of dementia are likely to get worse over time, and it’s wise to make plans well in advance of a person''s condition deteriorating. People with an incurable illness such as dementia, may be offered so-called end of life care (or palliative care) so they are able to live as well as possible until their death. End of life care also includes support for family members. Care can be provided at home, in a hospice, a care home, or hospital. Everyone who has been diagnosed with dementia should have a care plan drawn up with healthcare professionals. End of life care should be a key part of this dementia care plan. Details of end of life care included in the dementia care plan might include the person with dementia specifying where they would like to die, and how they''d like to be treated. The dementia care plan should also provide some support for carers, who will be grieving around the time of death. Read about coping with bereavement.  Preferences for end of life care should ideally be discussed and set out soon after a diagnosis of dementia. Actions such as making an advance statement of wishes should be thought about as soon as possible. The NHS Choices End of Life Planner has detailed information on planning for the end of life, including why it’s important to plan ahead, what to expect, how to prepare for it, and taking care of someone’s wellbeing in the meantime. End of life planning should also consider financial affairs and legal planning. Care at home for people with advanced dementia Palliative care services may sometimes be offered in the home, rather than in a hospice building. "Hospice-at-home" services have staff that are usually on call 24 hours a day and can visit people at home. Your GP can arrange for community palliative care nurses to provide care in the home. Your local authority may also provide social care services and equipment for the home. Read more about care at home. Hospice care for advanced dementia Hospices are specialist residential units run by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, counsellors and trained volunteers. They are smaller and quieter than hospitals and feel more like a home. Hospices can provide individual care more suited to individuals in a gentler, calmer atmosphere. There is no charge for hospice care, but patients must be referred to a hospice through their GP. Find hospice services near you. Palliative care in a care home Palliative care is available in residential care homes. If someone with dementia is already in a residential home, they may want to stay there for their palliative care. This may make them more comfortable and less distressed than having to go into hospital, unless that is necessary. You should ask if the residential home is accredited by the end of life Gold Standards network, which means that the home has specially trained staff and good links with local GPs. Read more about care homes and dementia. Palliative care for dementia as a hospice day patient If someone who has dementia prefers to remain living at home, they may be able to visit a hospice during the day. This means they can receive the care and support they need without permanently leaving their home. As a day patient, they will be able to access more services than could be offered if they stayed at home. Such services might include creative and complementary therapies and rehabilitation, as well as nursing and medical care. They will also meet other patients. Hospices often provide transport to and from the hospice. Page last reviewed: 09/07/2015 Next review due: 09/07/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

(392, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/typhus/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Brill-Zinsser disease', 'Typhus - NHS Choices', 'Typhus  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Typhus is a sudden severe illness caused by infection with Rickettsia bacteria. Outbreaks of typhus tend to occur in developing countries and areas where there is poverty, homelessness, close human contact and poor sanitation. The Rickettsia bacteria that cause typhus are carried by body lice, ticks, mites and fleas. This page covers the main types: epidemic typhus (the most serious form) – this type occurs in Africa, South America and Asia, and is transmitted by body lice  endemic typhus (the milder form of the disease) – it occurs throughout the world and is transmitted by ticks, mites and fleas  scrub typhus (also called Tsutsugamushi fever) – this type is caught from mites infected with Orientia tsutsugamushi bacteria, which live in heavy scrub vegetation in parts of rural southeast Asia, Oceania and northern Australia Typhus is generally not a problem in the UK. But you may become infected abroad if you catch Rickettsia-infected lice from infested people or bedding (in budget accommodation or on a sleeper train, for example), or if you are bitten by a Rickettsia-infected tick, mite or flea. How do you catch epidemic typhus? Epidemic typhus is passed from human to human by body lice. These are not the same as head lice or pubic lice, which are a nuisance, but don''t transmit disease. The body lice become infected with Rickettsia prowazekii bacteria when they feed on the blood of an infected person. If you catch these infected body lice (for example, by using a louse-infested blanket), their infected faeces will be deposited on your skin as they feed on your blood. You only need to scratch a bite to rub the contaminated lice faeces into the tiny wound on your skin to become infected. Less commonly, you can catch epidemic typhus by breathing infected dried body louse faeces in airborne dust. How do you catch endemic typhus? Endemic typhus is transmitted by ticks, mites and fleas infected with Rickettsia bacteria. These animal carriers of typhus may live in thick scrub vegetation or on small mammals or rodents, such as rats. What are the symptoms? The symptoms of epidemic, endemic and scrub typhus are similar. Typically, someone with typhus will start to feel unwell 10 to 14 days after becoming infected. A sudden, severe headache is often the first symptom. Other symptoms may include: a fever – where body temperature rises above 38.9C/102F for up to two weeks a pink or red rash that starts on the chest and spreads to the arms, hands, legs and feet – but not the face, palms and soles nausea and vomiting abdominal pain and diarrhoea joint and muscle pain – backache is common a cough In addition, the person with typhus is often mentally dazed or delirious – the word "typhus" comes from the Greek word meaning "a cloud". They may become deaf or have ringing in the ears (tinnitus). These symptoms usually last around two weeks. How is typhus diagnosed and treated? Anyone who is unwell shortly after visiting a high-risk country should see their GP, who will listen to your symptoms and take note of the countries you have recently visited. You will also be physically examined and have a number of tests – for example, a blood test to rule out other diseases such as malaria. If there is a rash, the GP may take a skin biopsy (a small sample of skin from the rash) and send this to a laboratory for testing. A diagnosis of typhus is confirmed if the Rickettsia bacteria are identified in a blood or skin sample. But the patient may be started on antibiotics even before the results come back if typhus is suspected. If treated promptly with either doxycycline or tetracycline, most patients improve dramatically within 48 hours of treatment and make a full recovery. If the patient has epidemic typhus (the more serious type), they may need to take antibiotics through a drip in their arm (intravenously) while they are in hospital. What are the possible complications? If typhus is not diagnosed and treated promptly, there is a risk of developing complications, including: long-term hearing loss or tinnitus low blood pressure organ damage and kidney failure secondary bacterial infection, such as pneumonia seizures confusion drowsiness gangrene The patient may need to have hospital follow-up for some months after recovering from an attack of typhus to receive treatment for these long-term problems. Brill-Zinsser disease Some people who previously had epidemic typhus will develop a milder form of the disease years later called Brill-Zinsser disease. This tends to happen when the bacteria were not properly killed off the first time and lie dormant (inactive) in the body. The bacteria then reactivate at a later date when the person''s immune system is weak. Brill-Zinsser disease will need treating again with antibiotics. Can typhus be prevented? There''s currently no licensed vaccine for typhus. The best way to avoid becoming infected with typhus is to avoid areas or crowds where louse-borne typhus is a problem, and take care to avoid contact with ticks, mites and fleas. Wash and change your clothes regularly, and don''t use any bedding or clothing that could be infested with body lice. If you''re about to travel abroad to an area where typhus is a problem, talk to your doctor about taking weekly doses of doxycycline to prevent infection. This is especially effective against scrub typhus.

(393, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/causes-of-dementia.aspx', NULL, 'What causes dementia? - Dementia guide - NHS Choices', '', 'Dementia is caused by gradual changes and damage in the brain. The most common causes of dementia include diseases in which the brain cells degenerate and die more quickly than they would as part of the normal ageing process. The changes usually happen because of a build-up of abnormal proteins in the brain. This damage leads to a decline in a person''s mental and, sometimes, physical abilities. The abnormal proteins are different in each type of these kinds of dementia. In most cases, dementia is not inherited directly from family members. However, frontotemporal dementia can sometimes run in families. Causes of vascular dementia Vascular dementia is caused when the brain''s blood supply is interrupted. Like all organs, the brain needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients from the blood to work properly. If the supply of blood is restricted or stopped, the brain cells will begin to die, leading to brain damage. If the blood vessels inside the brain narrow and harden, the brain''s blood supply can gradually become interrupted. The blood vessels usually narrow and become hard when fatty deposits build up on the blood vessel walls, restricting bloodflow. This is called atherosclerosis, and is more common in people who have high blood pressure, type 1 diabetes and those who smoke. Atherosclerosis in the smaller blood vessels in the brain will also cause them to clog up gradually, depriving the brain of blood. This is known as small vessel disease.  If the brain''s blood supply is interrupted rapidly during a stroke, this can also damage brain cells.  Not everyone who has had a stroke will go on to develop vascular dementia. However, if you have had a stroke or you have been diagnosed with small vessel disease, you may have an increased risk of developing vascular dementia. Read more about the causes of vascular dementia. Causes of Alzheimer''s disease Alzheimer''s disease is the most common form of dementia. In Alzheimer''s, the loss of brain cells leads to the brain shrinking. Part of the brain known as the cerebral cortex is particularly affected by this shrinkage. The cerebral cortex is the layer of grey matter covering the brain. Grey matter is responsible for processing thoughts and many of the complex functions of our brains, such as storing and retrieving memories, calculation, spelling, planning and organising. Clumps of protein, known as "plaques" and "tangles", gradually form in the brain. The plaques and tangles are thought to be responsible for the increasing loss of brain cells. Connections between brain cells are lost and less neurotransmitter chemicals are available to carry messages from one brain cell to another. The plaques and tangles also affect the chemicals that carry messages between brain cells. Causes of dementia with Lewy bodies Lewy bodies are small, circular lumps of protein that develop inside brain cells. It is not known what causes them. It is also unclear how they damage the brain and cause dementia. It''s possible that Lewy bodies interfere with the effects of two of the messenger chemicals in the brain called dopamine and acetylcholine. These messenger chemicals, which send information from one brain cell to another, are called neurotransmitters. Dopamine and acetylcholine are thought to play an important role in regulating brain functions, such as memory, learning, mood and attention. Dementia with Lewy bodies is closely related to Parkinson''s disease. This is a condition, where part of the brain becomes more and more damaged over a number of years, leading to physical symptoms, such as involuntary shaking (tremor), muscle stiffness and slow movement. A person with dementia with Lewy bodies may also develop these symptoms. Read more about dementia with Lewy bodies. Causes of frontotemporal dementia Frontotemporal dementia is caused by damage and shrinking in two areas of the brain. The areas of the brain affected are called the temporal lobe and the frontal lobe. This type of dementia is one of the more common types seen in people who are under 65 years of age. In an estimated 20% of cases, people who develop frontotemporal dementia have inherited a genetic mutation from their parents. Motor neurone disease is sometimes associated with frontotemporal dementia. It is a rare condition that damages the nervous system over time, causing the muscles to waste away. Read more about frontotemporal dementia. Less common causes of dementia Other causes of dementia or dementia-like conditions may be treatable or non-progressive (meaning they do not continue to get worse with time). These can include: depression infections, such as encephalitis and HIV-related infections some brain tumours a lack of vitamin B in the diet a lack of thyroid hormone head injury long-term alcohol misuse There are also rarer causes of neurodegenerative dementia, including: Huntington''s disease (a rare genetic condition that causes progessive brain damage) progressive supranuclear palsy corticobasal degeneration unusual forms of Alzheimer''s disease, such as posterior cortical atrophy, which usually presents with visual difficulties, rather than memory problems Page last reviewed: 17/06/2015 Next review due: 17/06/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

(394, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/newborn-hearing-test.aspx', 'Newborn hearing screening', 'Newborn hearing screening - Pregnancy and baby guide - NHS Choices', '', 'The newborn hearing screening test helps to identify babies who have permanent hearing loss as early as possible. This means parents can get the support and advice they need right from the start. One to two babies in every 1,000 are born with permanent hearing loss in one or both ears. This increases to about 1 in every 100 babies who have spent more than 48 hours in intensive care. Most of these babies are born into families with no history of permanent hearing loss. Permanent hearing loss can significantly affect a baby''s development. Finding out early can give these babies a better chance of developing language, speech, and communication skills. It will also help babies make the most of relationships with their family or carers from an early age. When is the newborn hearing test done? If you give birth in hospital, you may be offered a newborn hearing test for your baby before you are discharged. In some areas it will be done by a health professional, healthcare assistant or health visitor within the first few weeks. You will be contacted by your local newborn hearing screening service to arrange a suitable time and venue. Ideally, the test is done in the first four to five weeks, but it can be done at up to three months of age. If you are not offered a screening test, ask your health visitor, local audiology department or GP to arrange an appointment, or contact your local newborn hearing screening service. How is the newborn hearing test done? The test is called the automated otoacoustic emission (AOAE) test. It takes just a few minutes. A small soft-tipped earpiece is placed in your baby''s ear and gentle clicking sounds are played. When an ear receives sound, the inner part (called the cochlea) responds. This can be picked up by the screening equipment. It''s not always possible to get clear responses from the first test. This happens with a lot of babies, and does not always mean your baby has a permanent hearing loss. It could mean: your baby was unsettled when the test was done there was background noise your baby has fluid or a temporary blockage in their ear In these cases your baby will be offered a second test. This may be the same as the first test, or another type called the automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) test. The AABR test involves placing three small sensors on your baby''s head and neck. Soft headphones are placed over your baby''s ears and gentle clicking sounds are played. This test takes between 5 and 15 minutes. These tests will not harm your baby in any way. Does my baby have to have the newborn hearing test? It''s highly recommended, but you don''t have to accept it. If you decide not to have the screening test, you will be given checklists to help you check on your baby''s hearing as they grow older. If you have any concerns, you should speak to your health visitor or GP. When will we get the results? You will be given your baby''s hearing test results as soon as the test is done. If your baby has a clear response in both ears, they are unlikely to have permanent hearing loss. However, the newborn hearing test doesn''t pick up all types of permanent hearing loss. Children can also develop permanent hearing loss later on, so it''s important to check your child''s hearing as they grow up. The checklist in your baby''s personal child health record (red book) tells you how to do this. You can also download two checklists: one that tells you what sounds your baby should make, and another that tells you what sort of sounds your baby should react to. If you have any concerns about your child''s hearing, tell your health visitor or GP. What does it mean if my baby is referred to a hearing specialist? If the screening test results do not show a clear response from one or both of your baby''s ears, an appointment will be made with a hearing specialist at an audiology clinic. Even if this happens, it doesn''t necessarily mean your baby has a permanent hearing loss. A hearing specialist should see you within four weeks of your baby''s hearing test. It''s very important that you attend the appointment in case your baby does have permanent hearing loss. The appointment will usually take about one to two hours. This includes time to settle your baby. If possible, feed your baby shortly before the hearing test. Make sure you have the things you may need to keep them comfortable and happy. The tests will not hurt or be uncomfortable for your baby, and you will be able to stay with your baby while the tests are done. You may want to take your partner or a friend or relative with you to the appointment. The tests look similar to those used for your baby''s screening tests, but give more detailed information about your baby''s hearing. Your audiologist will usually be able to explain the results at the end of the appointment. They will explain what the results mean for your baby''s hearing and whether any further tests are necessary. What does it mean if my baby has permanent hearing loss? Types and levels of permanent hearing loss vary. Each baby''s hearing loss will be different. There is a range of support and information available, including leaflets on the different types of hearing loss: Your baby has a hearing loss Your baby has hearing loss in one ear Your baby has a mild hearing loss You can also contact the National Deaf Children''s Society (NDCS) freephone helpline on 0808 800 8880 (voice and text).

Living with dementia Media last reviewed: 14/07/2015 Next review due: 14/07/2017 If you are worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it''s a good idea to see your GP. If you''re worried about someone else, who you think has dementia, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. If you are forgetful, it doesn''t mean you have dementia. Memory problems can also be caused by depression, stress, drug side effects, or other health problems. It can be just as important to rule out these other problems or find ways to treat them. Your GP will be able to run through some simple checks and either reassure you, give you a diagnosis, or refer you to a specialist for further tests. An early diagnosis gives you both the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, and receive any treatment. With treatment and support from healthcare professionals, family and friends, many people are able to lead active, fulfilling lives. What to expect when you see your GP about dementia Your GP will ask about your symptoms and other aspects of your health, and will give you a physical examination. The doctor will organise some blood tests and ask about any medication you are taking, as these can sometimes cause symptoms similar to dementia. You will also be asked some questions or given some mental exercises to measure any problems with your memory or your ability to think clearly. Read more about the tests used to diagnose dementia. Referral to a dementia specialist Dementia can be difficult to diagnose, especially if your symptoms are mild. If your GP is unsure about your diagnosis, they will refer you to a specialist such as a neurologist (an expert in treating conditions that affect the brain and nervous system), an elderly care physician, or a psychiatrist with experience of treating dementia. The specialist may be based in a memory clinic alongside other professionals who are experts in diagnosing, caring for and advising people with dementia and their families. It''s important to make good use of your consultation with the specialist. Write down questions you want to ask, make a note of any medical terms the doctor might use, and ask if you can come back if you think of any more questions. Taking the opportunity to go back can be very helpful. The specialist may want to organise further tests, which may include brain scans such as a computerised tomography (CT) scan, or preferably a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. If they are still not certain about the diagnosis, you may need to have further, more complex, tests. Getting your dementia diagnosis Once you''ve had the necessary tests, your doctor should ask if you want to know your diagnosis. They should explain what having dementia might mean for you, and should give you time to talk more about the condition and ask any questions you may have. Unless you decide otherwise, your doctor or a member of their team should explain to you and your family: the type of dementia you have, or if it is not clear, what the plan to investigate further will entail; sometimes, despite investigations, a diagnosis may not be clear, in which case the doctors will review you again after a period of time to reassess you details about symptoms and how the illness might develop appropriate treatments that you might be offered care and support services in your area support groups and voluntary organisations for people with dementia and their families and carers advocacy services where you can find financial and legal advice You should also be given written information about dementia. Questions to ask about your dementia diagnosis In case you can''t think of any questions to ask you''re doctor, it may be worth asking: which type of dementia you have details about the tests or investigations you should have how long you will have to wait until you have the tests how long it will take to get the results of these tests what will happen after you get the results Ongoing dementia assessment Once you have been given a diagnosis, your GP should arrange to see you from time to time to see how you''re getting on. Because dementia is a progressive condition, the doctor may arrange another appointment with the specialist, perhaps after six months or a year. The GP and the specialist may also jointly prescribe medications that may be helpful in treating some of the symptoms of dementia. However, not everybody will benefit from these drugs. An ongoing assessment of your dementia may be a good time to consider your plans for the future, perhaps including a Lasting Power of Attorney to take care of your future welfare or financial needs, or an advance statement about your future care.

Usually, you can''t get more than one of these benefits at the same time. This means that even if you''re entitled to more than one earnings-replacement benefit, you''ll usually receive whichever is the highest. This is called the overlapping benefits rule. Earnings-replacement benefits The following earnings-replacement benefits are based on National Insurance (NI) contributions.  Bereavement Allowance (formerly Widow''s Pension) Contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance Contribution-based Jobseeker''s Allowance Maternity Allowance State Pension Widowed Parent''s Allowance Carer''s Allowance is not based on NI contributions. You usually can''t receive more than one of the above benefits at the same time. If you or the person you care for are entitled to more than one of these benefits, a benefit based on NI contributions will be paid in preference to Carer''s Allowance or any other earnings-replacement benefit that does not depend on NI contributions. If you''re entitled to two benefits, you''ll get the benefit that pays the higher amount. If you''re entitled to a benefit based on NI contributions, but this is worth less than another benefit not based on NI contributions, you''ll be paid the benefit based on NI contributions plus the difference between the two benefits. Increases for adult dependants Some earnings-replacement benefits may give you an increased amount if you have an adult dependant. You''ll only receive one increase for an adult dependant, even if you get more than one earnings-replacement benefit. You''ll receive the highest increase that can be paid. Overlapping benefits If you cannot be paid any Carer''s Allowance because you''re being paid another earnings-replacement benefit, you still have an underlying entitlement to Carer''s Allowance. Although you won''t be paid Carer''s Allowance, it''s worth making a claim for it. This is because the underlying entitlement to Carer''s Allowance means an amount called a carer premium, or carer addition for Pension Credit, can be included in the calculation of any means-tested benefits you''re entitled to. The carer premium or addition can make it more likely you''ll receive a means-tested benefit, or more of a means-tested benefit is paid to you. For example, Carol is 64 and looks after her husband. She gets a State Pension and Pension Credit. She makes a claim for Carer''s Allowance, but is told she cannot be paid it because it overlaps with the State Pension she receives. The letter she receives from the Carer''s Allowance Unit will tell her that although Carer''s Allowance cannot be paid, she has an underlying entitlement to it. Carol can then send a copy of this letter to the Pension Service (who pay her Pension Credit), and they will increase the amount of Pension Credit she receives. This is because a carer''s addition will be added to her Pension Credit. A carer addition can be paid as part of Pension Credit. A carer premium can be paid as part of the following means-tested benefits: Income Support Income-related Employment and Support Allowance Jobseeker''s Allowance Housing Benefit Find out more about benefits for carers.

There are clubs and activities designed to help people in the same situation, which can be rewarding for both the person with dementia and their families and carers. Everyone needs a sense of purpose and to enjoy themselves during the day. Encouraging someone with dementia to do something creative, some gentle exercise, or take part in an activity helps them to realise their potential, which improves their self-esteem and reduces loneliness. People with the early stages of dementia may enjoy walking, attending gym classes for older people, or meeting up with understanding and supportive friends. Read about how to raise self-esteem. If you care for someone who has dementia, a shared activity can also give you a chance to do something that makes both of you happier and able to enjoy quality time together. Multisensory activities can help dementia If the person you care for has become very withdrawn, you may want to explore different ways of connecting with them. The Alzheimer''s Society has more advice on how people with dementia can keep active and stay involved, by gardening, baking, doing puzzles and more. There are also ideas for remembering the past in a happy way, such as visiting a favourite place or putting together a memory box. A multisensory approach to interacting is particularly important when someone has advanced dementia. This is because bright colours, interesting sounds and tactile objects can all catch their attention in a way that other activities, such as making conversation or reading, may not any more. The website Elderly Activities has suggestions for games involving touch and smell, as well as memory exercises. Sensory gardens A growing number of care homes now offer a sensory garden for residents to spend time in. They are usually wheelchair-friendly and with carefully chosen plants and flowers to attract local wildlife. A sensory garden is a garden or other plot designed to provide visitors with different sensory experiences. For example, a sensory garden may feature:  scented and edible plants sculptures and sculpted handrails water features that residents can hear and touch textured touch-pads magnifying glass screens Braille and audio induction loop descriptions Sensory gardens can benefit older adults by encouraging them to spend more time outside. Their design and layout aim to provide a stimulating journey through the senses, heightening a person''s awareness of what''s around them. Getting out and about If you''d like to venture further from home, but are worried about managing the person with dementia''s needs, there are organisations that can support you both. Dementia Adventure offers outings and short breaks, such as barge sailing and woodland walks, designed for people living with dementia and their carers to enjoy together. Memory cafes A good way to meet other people with dementia and their carers is to find a "memory cafe" near you. Memory cafes offer an informal setting for people who are affected by memory problems and their carers to get support and advice. Memory cafes operate on a drop-in basis, giving people the chance to exchange experiences and information, and receive practical and emotional support. Some memory cafes offer activities, as well as advice and refreshments. The cafes are run by trained volunteers with the support of health professionals, and usually meet monthly for a couple of hours, although some meet fortnightly. Memory cafes are different from a "memory clinic", which is an NHS dementia service that involves assessing and diagnosing the condition, and requires a referral from a GP or hospital. Find a memory cafe near you. ''Singing for the brain'' Singing groups offer people with dementia and their carers a chance to sing and socialise with other people in the same situation. The Alzheimer''s Society runs Singing for the Brain groups around the country. Singing has been shown to improve the quality of life of people with dementia. Many people with dementia and their carers have said that it helps them feel better. Chreanne Montgomery-Smith, of the Alzheimer''s Society, helped devise Singing for the Brain sessions in 2003 after noticing how some people with dementia in a nursing home responded to singing. Chreanne explains: "I started doing a range of activities in the nursing home. One of them was a quiz game, which involved playing familiar tunes. The first week I did it nobody sang, and the second week a few people joined in. By the third week, everybody was singing. "One lady sang so much – she knew every song in the quiz, and remembered and sang them all. She felt very proud. And she was somebody who didn''t know her own name. It made me realise that people with dementia have a special ability to remember songs. It seemed to me a way of giving people confidence." There are now around 200 Singing for the Brain groups across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. They are free and open to anyone who has been diagnosed with dementia. Each session starts with warm-up exercises, which include physical movements. This might be rolling a small bean bag up one leg, passing it to your other hand and rolling it down the other, or clapping along to a song. All kinds of songs are used, and there are percussion instruments, such as drums, that people can play. "It seemed to me a way of giving people confidence," Chreanne Montgomery-Smith, co-founder of Singing for the Brain Finding a dementia singing group Singing for the Brain sessions take place in community buildings, such as church halls. To find a group near you, call the Alzheimer''s Society on 0300 222 1122. If there is no Singing for the Brain session in your area, you can ask your GP, local authority or charities such as Age UK whether they know of any local singing groups. "Singing for the Brain is mainly about engaging people and helping them to feel that life is worthwhile," says Chreanne. "I think the benefits are in confidence, self-esteem and friendship. Even if people with dementia can''t talk, they may be able to sing, whistle, clap or tap their feet. You can always sing at home. Sing along to a CD, or to hymns or other songs on the telly."

The carer premium or addition can make it more likely you''ll receive a means-tested benefit, or more of a means-tested benefit is paid to you. For example, Carol is 64 and looks after her husband. She gets a State Pension and Pension Credit. She makes a claim for Carer''s Allowance, but is told she cannot be paid it because it overlaps with the State Pension she receives. The letter she receives from the Carer''s Allowance Unit will tell her that although Carer''s Allowance cannot be paid, she has an underlying entitlement to it. Carol can then send a copy of this letter to the Pension Service (who pay her Pension Credit), and they will increase the amount of Pension Credit she receives.

Living with dementia Media last reviewed: 14/07/2015 Next review due: 14/07/2017 Soon after retiring in 1990, GP Joe McShane found out that his wife Ethna had developed Alzheimer''s disease. Joe cared for Ethna for six years, until a fall led to her being admitted to the Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester. The warning signs Joe describes the changes he saw in Ethna before she was diagnosed with Alzheimer''s. "I''d noticed changes two or three years before she was diagnosed, but it''s so hard to pinpoint, because Alzheimer''s begins so subtly. There are little changes here and there. "On one occasion, my daughter brought a friend home, and Ethna began chatting with her. 10 minutes later, she repeated exactly the same questions. Later, my daughter said to me, ''Dad, did you hear Mum? Do you think she''s developing Alzheimer''s?'' This was the first proper mention of the word. "Then in 1990, our daughter got engaged. But to my surprise, Ethna wasn''t as interested as she normally would be. Usually, she''d be very fussy about dresses and making the arrangements. She became quite passive. Anyway, the wedding happened and we retired soon after. "I then noticed that she started becoming unsure of herself and would say, ''Will you put on the washing?'' or ''Will you make lunch?'' At the golf course, I noticed that she was forgetting her score and wondering which club to use. "Finally, I went to see a colleague and told him there was something wrong. He arranged for her to see a neurologist on April 6, 1990. In the corridor, he told me that Ethna had Alzheimer''s. She wasn''t even 60." Coping as a dementia carer "After the diagnosis, we stayed at home, and I think I overprotected Ethna. I never let her leave the house on her own. That was fine for about four years. We led a very nice life. Then around 1994, my colleague, who''s a psychogeriatrician, suggested she should be admitted to the day hospital, so that I could have a break. That was how the condition was managed back then – supporting the patient''s family and carers." "That worked well for a couple of years, but in 1996 Ethna started walking more slowly, which we knew was common with Alzheimer''s. There were also times when she didn''t feel well. One day in late September, I was helping her get into the shower. I left her to get some fresh towels, and she collapsed in agony. "She had to be admitted to the hospital, where investigations showed that her lower spine had collapsed due to osteoporosis. She hasn''t walked since. After she''d been assessed, I was told that she needed total nursing care and that she couldn''t be managed at home, so I accepted the consultant''s offer to look after her in hospital." Joe''s advice "From a carer''s perspective, you go through stages. The first stage starts before the diagnosis. That''s very awkward. It''s a difficult time for the person with the illness and for the loved ones looking after them, as well as for the professionals. It''s not an easy diagnosis, and it takes great skill and expertise. But if you''re worried about the situation, don''t put off finding out what''s happening. Get it investigated. "Then there''s the stage after diagnosis. It''s important to remember that this diagnosis isn''t disastrous. Initially I thought it was, but it wasn''t. People with Alzheimer''s don''t become a different person overnight. It happens gradually, and people should be encouraged to live as normal and fruitful a life as possible, whatever a normal life means! Don''t just sit there and do nothing. "I''m a volunteer with the Manchester branch of the Alzheimer''s Society. I joined in 1994 and help to run carer support groups. Carers are often on their own, and going to a support group gives them a chance to meet one another and release their emotions. They can also bring their loved ones along. We also have days out. Keeping people out of isolation is so important, because carers tend to become isolated. Judging from my own experience, you tend to keep to yourself. "I''d say that one of the best things carers can do is join carer support groups. Meet other carers, share experiences and support one another. You can learn an awful lot." For information, support and advice for carers, call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053 or ask your local authority for a carer''s assessment.

You can buy your own equipment, but a social worker or occupational therapist can help make decisions about the equipment that would be most helpful. Decisions about the kind of equipment you may need will often be the result of an assessment of your care and support needs. If you have a child with a disability, their GP may refer them to a physiotherapist to assess their mobility needs. The physiotherapist assessing them will be able to explain what kinds of aids may help your child. You may also be entitled to a Disabled Facilities Grant if you need to adapt your home to make changes for a disabled child. This grant can help pay for adaptations such as building safe play areas, installing a stairlift, widening doors or adapting heating or light controls. Equipment that can help you to live more independently can include things like: two-handled cups, tap turners and kettle tippers for the kitchen grab rails and raised toilet seats in the bathroom bed raisers and hoists in the bedroom Free equipment from your local authority If a local authority needs assessment has concluded that you need this equipment, it should be provided free of charge. Minor adaptations costing £1,000 or less – which includes the cost of buying and fitting the adaptation – are also provided free of charge. Councils can make a charge for minor adaptations that cost more than £1,000 to provide. Larger, more expensive items may be classed as adaptations and will be the responsibility of the housing department and provided through Disabled Facilities Grants. If your child needs equipment to help them get full education, it may be provided by the school or the education department of your local authority. Many schools should be able to increase accessibility for individuals by making simple changes to help your child. These changes can include: providing wheelchair ramps and lifts providing railings and improved lighting for visually impaired children providing information in Braille or large print Equipment that can help you at work If you need equipment for work, the Access to Work scheme may be able to pay for the equipment. Contact the disability employment adviser at your local Jobcentre Plus for advice and assistance. Advice on disability, mobility and care equipment and adaptations Before you are provided with equipment, or you buy it, it’s worth getting independent advice to make sure that the type of equipment you’re getting is going to best meet your needs. You can get independent consumer research reports from Rica, an organisation which carries out consumer research for older and disabled people. Help is also available from the Disabled Living Foundation (DLF), a national charity that provides free, impartial advice about all types of home adaptation and mobility products for disabled adults and children, older people, their carers and families. Read more about wheelchairs and mobility equipment. The charity Independence at Home provides grants for disabled people and those with a long-term illness. Grants can be made for adaptations, equipment or other things to help manage at home if they''re not funded by local or national government. Tips on buying equipment Whether you’re buying equipment or having it provided for you, it’s always worth testing out the equipment for yourself first if possible. When installing equipment, you should also consider the following: Is your condition likely to deteriorate? If so, how much use will you get out of the equipment? Who will be operating the equipment – you, a carer, or both?  Does the equipment come with a guarantee and technical support? The Money Advice Service has further advice about shopping around for disability aids and equipment. Equipment and wheelchair loans The NHS can provide equipment, such as walking sticks, walking frames and wheelchairs to aid mobility. These are provided on long-term loans and you can arrange this through your GP, hospital consultant or physiotherapist. There is no charge for this equipment, but there may be a returnable deposit. There may be times when you might want to borrow equipment on a short-term loan – for example, if you’re away from home. Local Red Cross branches can often lend wheelchairs and equipment for short periods. Page last reviewed: 15/01/2015 Next review due: 15/01/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Most people have to pay something towards their own care and some will have to pay for all of the costs. Your local authority (council) may cover some or all of the cost of care in some circumstances, but its help is "means-tested". This means that who pays depends on what your needs are, how much money you have, and what level and type of care and support you require. For most people needing social care services, the first place to start is by asking your local authority for an assessment of your social care (care and support) needs. If the local authority considers that you need support that it can provide, it may also carry out an assessment of your finances. This assessment will determine whether the local authority will meet all the cost of your care, or whether you will need to contribute towards your care cost or whether you will have to meet the full costs yourself. Find out about support paid for by your local authority. Currently, local authorities won’t provide care services if you have more than £23,250 in savings and property (your "capital"). However, from April 2020, this threshold will rise alongside the introduction of the cap on care costs, so more people will be eligible for help sooner. Alternatives to care funded by the local authority  NHS care The NHS is responsible for funding certain types of healthcare equipment you may need. In some situations, the NHS is also responsible for meeting care needs. This is usually when your need is mainly for healthcare rather than social care NHS care could be provided in hospital, but it could be in someone’s own home or elsewhere in the community. NHS continuing healthcare If the person you care for has very severe and complex health needs, they may qualify for NHS continuing healthcare. This is an ongoing package of care that’s fully funded by the NHS. In some areas of the country, you can arrange your NHS Continuing Healthcare using a personal health budget – similar to the personal budgets for social care outlined above. Find out about personal health budgets. NHS-funded nursing care You should receive NHS-funded nursing care if: you live in a care home registered to provide nursing care, and you don’t qualify for NHS continuing healthcare but have been assessed as needing care from a registered nurse The NHS will make a payment directly to the care home to fund care from registered nurses who are usually employed by the care home. For more information see What is NHS-funded nursing care? NHS aftercare People who were previously detained in hospital under certain sections of the Mental Health Act will have their aftercare services provided for free. Help from charities and funds There are other sources of funding you might be able to access to help you with funding care. Some charities can help with funding care needs. For example, the Family Fund is a government-backed charity that can help with grants if you care for a severely disabled child aged 17 or under. You can get an application pack from the Family Fund website. Get personal advice on care funding The cost of care and support is likely to be a long-term commitment and may be substantial, particularly if you choose to go into a care home, or if you have care needs at an early age. If you or a member of the family need to pay for care at home or in a care home, it’s important to understand the alternatives. This makes advice tailored to your individual needs vital. You can get advice from: your local authority – through an assessment of your care and support needs, as well as advice on which services are available locally financial advice from a qualified, independent source – there are independent financial advisers who specialise in care funding advice; they are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and must stick to a code of conduct and ethics, and take shared responsibility for the suitability of any product they recommend Page last reviewed: 29/07/2015 Next review due: 29/07/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

You shouldn’t be discharged from hospital until: You are medically fit (this can only be decided by the consultant or someone the consultant has said can make the decision on their behalf). You have had an assessment to look at the support you need to be discharged safely. You have been given a written care plan that sets out the support you’ll get to meet your assessed needs.  The support described in your care plan has been put in place and it’s safe for you to be discharged. Each hospital has its own discharge policy. You should be able to get a copy of this from the ward manager or the hospital’s Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS). A hospital’s discharge policy should state how patients and carers are involving in discharge planning. You can decide whether you want a family carer involved in decisions about your future care. If you have limited capacity to make your own decision, the Mental Capacity Act will apply. It is worth thinking about appointing a deputy or enacting a welfare power of attorney before you go into hospital. Before you go into hospital If you’re due to go into hospital in a planned way, such as for an operation, planning for what happens afterwards should happen before you ever arrive at the hospital. For unplanned admissions, such as if you’ve had a fall and hurt yourself, discharge planning should begin on the day you’re admitted to hospital. You’ll usually be given an estimated date of discharge within 24 to 48 hours of being admitted to hospital. Your progress will be reviewed and, if there’s likely to be a change to your discharge date, you should be kept updated. Read more about what happens after surgery. The person co-ordinating your discharge for should be available each day, and you should be given their name and details of how to contact them. They are sometimes called "discharge co-ordinators" or "ward co-ordinators". Hospital discharge assessment and care plan A discharge assessment looks at the needs you are likely to have when you’re discharged or transferred from hospital. Many people only need a small amount of support when they leave hospital, but others will need a more comprehensive package of care. If you are likely to have ongoing health and social care needs when you leave hospital, the assessment may be carried out by a multidisciplinary team of health or social care professionals. Depending on your needs, the multidisciplinary team could include a social worker, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, mental health nurse or dietitian. You should be fully involved in the assessment process, and your views should be listened to. With your permission, any family carers will also be kept informed and given the opportunity to contribute. If you would like help putting your views across, an independent advocate (for example, from a charity such as Age UK) may be able to help. A care plan will be drawn up, detailing the health and social care support for you, and you should be fully involved. The care plan should include details of: the treatment and support you will get when you’re discharged  who will be responsible for providing support, and how to contact them when, and how often, support will be provided  how the support will be monitored and reviewed  the name of the person who is co-ordinating the care plan  who to contact if there’s an emergency or if things don’t work as they should  information about any charges that will need to be paid (if applicable) What might be in a care plan? The types of support in someone’s care plan will depend on their assessed needs and preferences. A care plan could include: Community care services from the local authority, such as reablement services: An assessment for these must be arranged if it seems that you may need them. NHS continuing healthcare. NHS funded nursing care. Intermediate care: This is short-term care that’s provided free of charge for people who no longer need to be in hospital but may need extra support to help them recover. It lasts for a maximum of six weeks and can be provided in someone’s home or in a residential setting. Other NHS services, such as rehabilitation or palliative care.   Equipment such as wheelchairs, specialist beds, or aids and adaptations for daily living. Support from voluntary agencies: Some organisations such as Age UK and the Red Cross provide "home from hospital" services that can help with household tasks or shopping while you settle back home.  Care and support that’s paid for privately. This may be an option you aren’t eligible for help from the local authority. Carers’ involvement in hospital discharge If someone you know is in hospital and about to be discharged, you should not be put under pressure to accept a caring role or take on more than you’re already doing if you are already their carer. You should be given adequate time to consider whether or not this is what you want or are able to do. If necessary, you should ask for other arrangements to be made while you are reaching a decision. If you decide that you are going to provide care for the person who is being discharged from hospital, you’re entitled to your own carer’s assessment from social services. It is possible that your carer’s assessment will be done over a period of time, beginning before the person you''re looking after is discharged from hospital and continuing once they are home. When you are discharged from hospital On the day of discharge, the person co-ordinating the discharge should make sure that: you (and a carer if you have one) have a copy of the care plan  transport is arranged to get you home any carers will be available if needed  your GP is notified in writing you have any medication or other supplies you’ll need  you’ve been trained how to use any equipment, aids or adaptations needed you have appropriate clothes to wear   you have money and keys for your home If you are being discharged to a care home, the care home should also be told the date and time of your discharge, and have a copy of the care plan. After discharge from hospital Your care should be monitored and reviewed as set out in your care plan. The care plan should also include details of who to contact if things don’t work as planned. If your care plan includes community care services from a local authority, it should check that their care package is working well within two weeks of discharge. If you live alone, this should take place within the first few days of discharge. Following this, your care plan should be reviewed at least annually. Complaints about hospital discharge You might not be happy with the way your discharge from hospital is being handled. For example, if: the hospital plans to discharge you before you think it’s safe there isn’t enough support in your care plan you don’t think your discharge assessment and care planning was carried out correctly If you are in this situation or you have concerns about someone else who is still in hospital, it’s best to raise them straight away so that they can be addressed as soon as possible. Speak to the person who is co-ordinating the discharge, or the supervising consultant. You may find it helpful to get support from the hospital’s Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) or your local Independent Health Complaints Advocacy service. If you want to complain about how a hospital discharge was handled, you could start by speaking to the staff involved to see if the problem can be resolved informally.

Symptoms of memory loss, confusion and difficulty learning new things means that someone with dementia may forget where they are, where things are and how things work. If they''re able to stay in their own home, the familiar objects will be reassuring, and it''s not advisable to make major changes or adaptations to their homes overnight. However, there are simple, affordable things you can do that may help them to continue living independently and safely. Better lighting can help people with dementia Dementia tends to affect older people, who are likely to have poorer eyesight. People with dementia can also feel disorientated in the dark, so leaving a nightlight on can help. Most people with dementia benefit from better lighting in their home – it can help to avoid confusion and reduce the risk of falls. Using higher wattage light bulbs will boost the lighting in your home, but remember to first check the maximum level the fitting can take. Increase natural light in a room by making sure the curtains are open and that unnecessary nets or blinds are removed. Cut back hedges or trees if they overshadow the window and block out sunlight. Lighting is particularly important on the stairs and in the toilet. Light switches should be easily accessible and straightforward to use. Reducing excess noise may help with dementia Reduce background noise by turning the television or radio off if nobody is paying attention to it. Carpets, cushions and curtains improve the acoustics of a room by absorbing background noise. If you have laminate or vinyl flooring, simply walking across the room can be very noisy. If the person you care for wears a hearing aid, it will magnify these sounds and can make it uncomfortable for them. If their hearing has deteriorated with age, make sure they get regular hearing checks and are fitted with hearing aids, if necessary. People with dementia can have their symptoms made worse by problems with sight and hearing together (known as deafblindness or dual sensory loss). Read more about dual sensory loss from the charity Sense. Safe flooring and dementia If you need to replace the carpet in someone''s home, choose one that''s the same colour throughout the whole house, as this can be less confusing for someone with dementia. Avoid shiny or reflective flooring, as this may be perceived as being wet, and the person with dementia may struggle to walk over it. Try to avoid rugs or mats on the floor, as some people with dementia may become confused and think the rug or mat is an object that they need to step over, which could lead to trips or falls. Contrasting colours may help to navigate  Contrasting colours on the walls and floors can give the person with dementia a sense of depth and perspective in a room. Having furniture in contrasting colours can make it easier for them to find and use. Doors and banisters painted in a different colour to the walls will make them stand out. Toilet seats that contrast in colour with the rest of the room will help the person with dementia to find the toilet. Similarly, tablecloths that are a different colour to the plates will help them to see their food better. Bed linen, towels, soft furnishings and wallpaper should be bold colours rather than pastels, which blend together easily. Patterns should be avoided, as they can be disturbing for people with dementia. They may see faces or shapes in the patterns, which can be confusing for them. Reflections can be troubling If the person you care for doesn''t recognise their own reflection, they may think that the face they see in the mirror or the person reflected in the window is a stranger. This can be distressing for them. It can help to cover mirrors with a roller blind or curtain and close curtains in the evening, so they can''t see their own reflection in the glass. Labels may help someone with dementia get around It''s a good idea to label drawers, cupboards and doors to show what''s inside them. For example, you could put a photo of the toilet on the toilet door, a photo of the cups on the cupboard that contains the cups, and so on. Alternatively, transparent cupboard doors can be of great help to someone with dementia, as they can then see what''s inside. Dementia-friendly household items It''s possible to get household items that are specifically designed for people with dementia. For example, these items can include cups with two handles, clocks with large LCD displays, telephones with big buttons, devices to open jars, and so forth. There are several websites that sell daily living aids, such as the Alzheimer''s Society online shop. You may find that the person you care for prefers traditional fixtures and fittings, such as taps, a toilet flush or bath plugs. Sleek modern designs may be confusing. Ensure that any tables are stable and have round, smooth edges. They should be at a suitable height, so that food and drink can be seen and a wheelchair can fit underneath if needed. Gardens and outside spaces can be made to help people with dementia Like everyone else, people with dementia may benefit from going outside to get some fresh air and exercise. Ensure that walking surfaces are flat to prevent any trips or falls. The outdoor space should be secure, to stop the person you look after from wandering. Raised flower beds can help people with restricted mobility actively look after their garden by doing watering, planting or weeding. Providing sturdy, sheltered seating areas will allow the person you care for to stay outside longer. Bird feeders or tables and bat, bird or bug boxes will attract more wildlife into the garden.

Most people have to pay something towards their own care and some will have to pay for all of the costs. Your local authority (council) may cover some or all of the cost of care in some circumstances, but its help is "means-tested". This means that who pays depends on what your needs are, how much money you have, and what level and type of care and support you require. For most people needing social care services, the first place to start is by asking your local authority for an assessment of your social care (care and support) needs. If the local authority considers that you need support that it can provide, it may also carry out an assessment of your finances. This assessment will determine whether the local authority will meet all the cost of your care, or whether you will need to contribute towards your care cost or whether you will have to meet the full costs yourself. Find out about support paid for by your local authority. Currently, local authorities won’t provide care services if you have more than £23,250 in savings and property (your "capital"). However, from April 2020, this threshold will rise alongside the introduction of the cap on care costs, so more people will be eligible for help sooner. Alternatives to care funded by the local authority  NHS care The NHS is responsible for funding certain types of healthcare equipment you may need. In some situations, the NHS is also responsible for meeting care needs. This is usually when your need is mainly for healthcare rather than social care NHS care could be provided in hospital, but it could be in someone’s own home or elsewhere in the community. NHS continuing healthcare If the person you care for has very severe and complex health needs, they may qualify for NHS continuing healthcare. This is an ongoing package of care that’s fully funded by the NHS. In some areas of the country, you can arrange your NHS Continuing Healthcare using a personal health budget – similar to the personal budgets for social care outlined above. Find out about personal health budgets. NHS-funded nursing care You should receive NHS-funded nursing care if: you live in a care home registered to provide nursing care, and you don’t qualify for NHS continuing healthcare but have been assessed as needing care from a registered nurse The NHS will make a payment directly to the care home to fund care from registered nurses who are usually employed by the care home. For more information see What is NHS-funded nursing care? NHS aftercare People who were previously detained in hospital under certain sections of the Mental Health Act will have their aftercare services provided for free. Help from charities and funds There are other sources of funding you might be able to access to help you with funding care. Some charities can help with funding care needs. For example, the Family Fund is a government-backed charity that can help with grants if you care for a severely disabled child aged 17 or under. You can get an application pack from the Family Fund website. Get personal advice on care funding The cost of care and support is likely to be a long-term commitment and may be substantial, particularly if you choose to go into a care home, or if you have care needs at an early age. If you or a member of the family need to pay for care at home or in a care home, it’s important to understand the alternatives. This makes advice tailored to your individual needs vital. You can get advice from: your local authority – through an assessment of your care and support needs, as well as advice on which services are available locally financial advice from a qualified, independent source – there are independent financial advisers who specialise in care funding advice; they are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and must stick to a code of conduct and ethics, and take shared responsibility for the suitability of any product they recommend Page last reviewed: 29/07/2015 Next review due: 29/07/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

If you''ve just been diagnosed with dementia, you may be feeling numb, scared and unable to take everything in. Give yourself a little time to adjust. It might help to talk it through with family and friends. Once the initial feelings have passed, it''s time to move on and create an action plan for the future. Dementia is a progressive illness, so the sooner you take care of legal, financial and healthcare matters, the better. These are the key things to think about: Get assessed Your local authority has a duty to carry out a care and support needs assessment to establish which of its services you need. To arrange an assessment, contact social services or your GP. Read more about how to get an assessment for a person with dementia. For further information, read the Alzheimer''s Society''s factsheet on community care assessments. Services and support Find out what''s available locally, so you''re prepared and able to call on this support as and when you need it. Services arranged by local authorities vary between areas, but may include home care services, equipment and adaptations for your home. Some services, such as community nursing, are arranged through the NHS. Ask your hospital consultant for details.

Read more about what to expect from social services and the NHS and where to find sources of help and support for people with dementia. Making a will It''s a good idea to make a will, if you haven''t already. This ensures that when you die, your money and possessions go to people of your choosing. A person with dementia can still make or change a will, provided you can show that you understand what you are doing and what the effects of it will be. Your solicitor will decide if this is the case. Read more about dementia and legal issues, including making a will. The Alzheimer''s Society also has a useful factsheet on managing legal affairs. Putting your papers in order Make sure that all your important papers can be easily found. These might include bank and building society statements, mortgage or rent documents, insurance policies, your will, tax and pension details, bills and guarantees. Consider setting up direct debits or standing orders for your regular bills. This will mean they are paid automatically from your bank account each month. Read more about managing someone else''s banking. Claiming benefits Check that you are claiming all the benefits you''re entitled to. In particular, check: whether you are eligible for Personal Independence Payment (which replaced Disability Living Allowance in early 2013) or Attendance Allowance whether your carer (if you have one) is eligible for Carer''s Allowance Other benefits you may be eligible for include income support or minimum income guarantee, incapacity benefit, housing benefit and council tax relief. Read more about managing money when someone has dementia. The Alzheimer''s Society''s factsheet on benefits can also tell you what''s on offer and how to claim. Lasting power of attorney You can appoint one or more people as "attorneys" to manage your affairs, including your finances, property and medical treatment, should it become necessary. You can choose anybody you trust to be your attorney, usually a close friend or family member, but they must be over 18. Read more about power of attorney. Advance care planning You may wish to make an advance care plan, so you can have a say in your future medical care. It enables you to refuse, in advance, a specific medical treatment or procedure, should you become unable to decide for yourself in the future. Find out about advance care planning.

You have been given a written care plan that sets out the support you’ll get to meet your assessed needs.  The support described in your care plan has been put in place and it’s safe for you to be discharged. Each hospital has its own discharge policy. You should be able to get a copy of this from the ward manager or the hospital’s Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS).

However, a healthy lifestyle can help lower your risk of developing dementia when you are older. It can also prevent cardiovascular diseases, such as strokes and heart attacks. To reduce your risk of developing dementia and other serious health conditions, it''s recommended that you: eat a healthy diet maintain a healthy weight exercise regularly don''t drink too much alcohol stop smoking (if you smoke) make sure to keep your blood pressure at a healthy level Diet and dementia A low-fat, high-fibre diet including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and wholegrains can help reduce your risk of some kinds of dementia. Limiting the amount of salt in your diet to no more than six grams a day can also help. Too much salt will increase your blood pressure, which puts you at risk of developing some types of dementia. High cholesterol levels may also put you at risk of developing some kinds of dementia, so try to limit the amount of food you eat that is high in saturated fat. Read more about eating healthily. How weight affects dementia risk Being overweight can increase your blood pressure, which increases your risk of getting some kinds of dementia. The risk is higher if you are obese. The most scientific way to measure your weight is to calculate your body mass index (BMI). You can calculate your BMI using the BMI healthy weight calculator. People with a BMI of 25-30 are overweight, and those with a BMI above 30 are obese. People with a BMI of 40 or more are morbidly obese. Read more about losing weight.

Find out about support paid for by your local authority. Currently, local authorities won’t provide care services if you have more than £23,250 in savings and property (your "capital"). However, from April 2020, this threshold will rise alongside the introduction of the cap on care costs, so more people will be eligible for help sooner. Alternatives to care funded by the local authority  NHS care The NHS is responsible for funding certain types of healthcare equipment you may need. In some situations, the NHS is also responsible for meeting care needs. This is usually when your need is mainly for healthcare rather than social care NHS care could be provided in hospital, but it could be in someone’s own home or elsewhere in the community. NHS continuing healthcare If the person you care for has very severe and complex health needs, they may qualify for NHS continuing healthcare. This is an ongoing package of care that’s fully funded by the NHS. In some areas of the country, you can arrange your NHS Continuing Healthcare using a personal health budget – similar to the personal budgets for social care outlined above. Find out about personal health budgets. NHS-funded nursing care You should receive NHS-funded nursing care if: you live in a care home registered to provide nursing care, and you don’t qualify for NHS continuing healthcare but have been assessed as needing care from a registered nurse The NHS will make a payment directly to the care home to fund care from registered nurses who are usually employed by the care home.

(411, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/living-with-dementia-real-story.aspx', NULL, 'Real story: Living with dementia - Dementia guide - NHS Choices', '', 'Peter Van Spyk had Alzheimer’s for 10 years before he was diagnosed. In that time, the family business failed and his relationship with his wife Pat became very strained. Pat and Peter describe in their own words how dementia has affected their lives. Before the diagnosis "It wasn’t until 1995 that I first noticed that Peter was acting strangely. I thought he wasn’t interested in his business any more. He appointed a manager and took early retirement at the age of 54. From then on, he became a different person. "It all came to a head in 2005 when I opened a letter from the bank asking for £35,000. I read all the bank statements and paperwork from the previous five years. I realised the business, which we were relying on for our retirement, was heavily in debt. The best option was to go into voluntary liquidation. It took a long time to sell the factory and sort out our £360,000 debt. It gave me a very big shock. "I went to see the doctor in 2005 because I was depressed and terrified about what was happening to the business. I told the doctor I didn’t know what was wrong with Peter. I said I couldn’t communicate with Peter and that he didn’t seem to understand what was happening. "We went to Addenbrooke''s Hospital, where Peter saw a psychiatrist, and had blood tests and MRI scans. In October 2006, the Alzheimer''s was officially diagnosed. I think it was a relief for Peter. "For me, it was a double blow because I had thought that Peter would be normal once we sorted out the money situation. I can remember hearing the diagnosis from our GP. I went incredibly still, and I don’t think I took a breath for ages. Taking it in was so hard, really. I saw no future for us because I realised how difficult it was going to be. "We were given the drug Aricept, which made a big improvement initially, though it''s now less effective. Peter has been quite positive about his condition, but occasionally he doesn’t want to face the reality." Peter and Pat Van Spyk Reading the signs "You''d never suspect Alzheimer’s in someone so young. Peter was 61 when he was diagnosed but, looking back, I could see that he was about 50 when he started acting strangely. "It was his lack of spatial awareness, his lack of comprehension and his slightly irresponsible attitude that made me first aware that something was seriously wrong. He started scraping the car, which we spent a fortune fixing. Also, he twice tried to cut the hedge and nearly cut his fingers off. "He didn’t want to socialise. Conversations that involve more than two or three people are too fast for him to understand. I used to think he was being stupid. He would look at me blankly as if he didn’t know what I was saying." Everyday life "Peter changes a lot. One minute he’s very worried because he’s lost sight of me, the next minute, he’s full of confidence and pushing through the crowd. He also finds dressing himself very difficult and gets the shirt buttons all mixed up. "I might say to him, ‘Put the kettle on and let''s have a cup of tea’. He’ll say ‘yes’, but I’ll come into the kitchen and find that the kettle isn’t on because Peter hasn''t really understood the message. Or he’ll put the kettle on and forget that he’s doing it, so you have to watch him. Once I get Peter to do something, he''ll complete it, but if he doesn''t know how to start it he''ll stand there and wait. "You have to learn to be patient. Sometimes I get angry, but I just walk away and hope for the best. I spoke to the doctor and told him that sometimes I speak very sharply to Peter. "It’s awful because he was so full of energy, and I trusted him with everything because he had a sharp mind. "We finally sorted our finances out last year (2007). We can stay in our house but I don’t know for how long. It has been quite traumatic for me. Peter doesn’t seem to realise our problems, but apparently that’s part of the disease. "When you''re affected by Alzheimer’s it''s very hard for you and your family not to become depressed. I don’t have children to share the load and sometimes I feel rather low. "Things are getting better, though. We were allocated a nurse by the NHS who is our link to the team at Addenbrooke''s Hospital. Also, an outreach person from the Alzheimer’s Society is coming to see us and assess how things might be. I keep putting off thinking about the future, and so does Peter. Obviously I’m at the beginning of a long journey. I’m just trying to be as positive as possible." Peter''s story "I think it’s a terrible disease, I really do. I owe my success to Patsy. She’s really been doing good. She''s absolutely fair in everything. She gets a bit cross, so I try to keep it back." Peter begins to struggle with conversation. He says: "If you’ve had a good education then it’s easier to remember words... I was very lucky to get Aricept. That made a difference. Pat said I changed immediately, but things have gone down again." When asked what advice he’d give someone diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, Peter encourages them to be realistic and accept their limitations. "Some people complain that they can’t have their car… when I was diagnosed I realised the bad things I was doing while driving. You have to surrender your licence." About joining the Alzheimer’s Society, he says, "That’s something I’d suggest to anybody. They really should get in touch with them."

You shouldn’t be discharged from hospital until: You are medically fit (this can only be decided by the consultant or someone the consultant has said can make the decision on their behalf). You have had an assessment to look at the support you need to be discharged safely. You have been given a written care plan that sets out the support you’ll get to meet your assessed needs.  The support described in your care plan has been put in place and it’s safe for you to be discharged. Each hospital has its own discharge policy. You should be able to get a copy of this from the ward manager or the hospital’s Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS). A hospital’s discharge policy should state how patients and carers are involving in discharge planning. You can decide whether you want a family carer involved in decisions about your future care. If you have limited capacity to make your own decision, the Mental Capacity Act will apply. It is worth thinking about appointing a deputy or enacting a welfare power of attorney before you go into hospital. Before you go into hospital If you’re due to go into hospital in a planned way, such as for an operation, planning for what happens afterwards should happen before you ever arrive at the hospital. For unplanned admissions, such as if you’ve had a fall and hurt yourself, discharge planning should begin on the day you’re admitted to hospital. You’ll usually be given an estimated date of discharge within 24 to 48 hours of being admitted to hospital. Your progress will be reviewed and, if there’s likely to be a change to your discharge date, you should be kept updated. Read more about what happens after surgery. The person co-ordinating your discharge for should be available each day, and you should be given their name and details of how to contact them. They are sometimes called "discharge co-ordinators" or "ward co-ordinators". Hospital discharge assessment and care plan A discharge assessment looks at the needs you are likely to have when you’re discharged or transferred from hospital. Many people only need a small amount of support when they leave hospital, but others will need a more comprehensive package of care. If you are likely to have ongoing health and social care needs when you leave hospital, the assessment may be carried out by a multidisciplinary team of health or social care professionals. Depending on your needs, the multidisciplinary team could include a social worker, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, mental health nurse or dietitian. You should be fully involved in the assessment process, and your views should be listened to. With your permission, any family carers will also be kept informed and given the opportunity to contribute. If you would like help putting your views across, an independent advocate (for example, from a charity such as Age UK) may be able to help. A care plan will be drawn up, detailing the health and social care support for you, and you should be fully involved. The care plan should include details of: the treatment and support you will get when you’re discharged  who will be responsible for providing support, and how to contact them when, and how often, support will be provided  how the support will be monitored and reviewed  the name of the person who is co-ordinating the care plan  who to contact if there’s an emergency or if things don’t work as they should  information about any charges that will need to be paid (if applicable) What might be in a care plan? The types of support in someone’s care plan will depend on their assessed needs and preferences. A care plan could include: Community care services from the local authority, such as reablement services: An assessment for these must be arranged if it seems that you may need them. NHS continuing healthcare. NHS funded nursing care. Intermediate care: This is short-term care that’s provided free of charge for people who no longer need to be in hospital but may need extra support to help them recover. It lasts for a maximum of six weeks and can be provided in someone’s home or in a residential setting. Other NHS services, such as rehabilitation or palliative care.   Equipment such as wheelchairs, specialist beds, or aids and adaptations for daily living. Support from voluntary agencies: Some organisations such as Age UK and the Red Cross provide "home from hospital" services that can help with household tasks or shopping while you settle back home.  Care and support that’s paid for privately. This may be an option you aren’t eligible for help from the local authority. Carers’ involvement in hospital discharge If someone you know is in hospital and about to be discharged, you should not be put under pressure to accept a caring role or take on more than you’re already doing if you are already their carer. You should be given adequate time to consider whether or not this is what you want or are able to do. If necessary, you should ask for other arrangements to be made while you are reaching a decision. If you decide that you are going to provide care for the person who is being discharged from hospital, you’re entitled to your own carer’s assessment from social services. It is possible that your carer’s assessment will be done over a period of time, beginning before the person you''re looking after is discharged from hospital and continuing once they are home. When you are discharged from hospital On the day of discharge, the person co-ordinating the discharge should make sure that: you (and a carer if you have one) have a copy of the care plan  transport is arranged to get you home any carers will be available if needed  your GP is notified in writing you have any medication or other supplies you’ll need  you’ve been trained how to use any equipment, aids or adaptations needed you have appropriate clothes to wear   you have money and keys for your home If you are being discharged to a care home, the care home should also be told the date and time of your discharge, and have a copy of the care plan. After discharge from hospital Your care should be monitored and reviewed as set out in your care plan. The care plan should also include details of who to contact if things don’t work as planned. If your care plan includes community care services from a local authority, it should check that their care package is working well within two weeks of discharge. If you live alone, this should take place within the first few days of discharge. Following this, your care plan should be reviewed at least annually. Complaints about hospital discharge You might not be happy with the way your discharge from hospital is being handled. For example, if: the hospital plans to discharge you before you think it’s safe there isn’t enough support in your care plan you don’t think your discharge assessment and care planning was carried out correctly If you are in this situation or you have concerns about someone else who is still in hospital, it’s best to raise them straight away so that they can be addressed as soon as possible. Speak to the person who is co-ordinating the discharge, or the supervising consultant. You may find it helpful to get support from the hospital’s Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) or your local Independent Health Complaints Advocacy service. If you want to complain about how a hospital discharge was handled, you could start by speaking to the staff involved to see if the problem can be resolved informally.

However, there are sources of help and support for everyone involved. It''s natural to worry about the future, but it''s important to remember that you''re not alone. The NHS, social services and voluntary organisations can provide advice and support. Get a needs assessment Following a diagnosis of dementia, one of the first steps to take is to get a health and social care assessment. This assessment is how a person with dementia, and the person or people looking after them, gets help and support from their local authority''s social services department. The assessment is carried out by social services to find out what help and support you need – such as healthcare, equipment, care services in your home, or a stay in a care home. If a person with dementia has ongoing medical care needs, they may qualify for free NHS continuing care, which will be assessed by NHS staff. Read more about what to expect from the NHS and social services. Care options for people with dementia Many people with dementia stay in their own home if they have adequate support, either from family carers, community nurses or paid care workers. Being in familiar surroundings can help people cope better with their condition. Read about caring for someone at home and find out about small adjustments to the home that can help people with dementia. Many people with dementia will eventually need support in a residential care home. This could be a care home or a nursing home, depending on their needs. The Alzheimer''s Society has reported that around two-thirds of people in care homes have some form of dementia. However, not all care homes are suitable for people with dementia. If you care for someone with dementia and they have to go into a care home, try to make their room as familiar as possible. For example, put photos of family and friends where they will see them every day. Favourite pictures, furniture and ornaments could also make them feel more at home. You may be able to arrange a trial period in a care home for the person you care for. Some people with severe dementia may need palliative care in a hospice, where they can receive good nursing care and pain control. Admiral Nurses Admiral Nurses are registered nurses and experts in dementia care. They give practical, clinical and emotional support to families living with dementia to improve their quality of life and help them cope. Admiral Nurses work in the community, care homes, hospitals and hospices. To talk to an Admiral Nurse, call Admiral Nursing Direct on 0800 888 6678. The helpline is open seven days a week from 9am to 5pm; also from 6pm to 9pm on Wednesday and Thursday. The helpline is a free service for carers, people with dementia, and health and social care professionals. Charities for people with dementia There are several dementia charities that can offer excellent advice and support. The leading dementia charity is the Alzheimer''s Society. Its website contains essential information on dementia and Alzheimer''s disease, including how to live well with the disease and how to find help near you. Dementia UK is a national charity that aims to improve the quality of life for people with dementia. It offers advice and support to families who are living with dementia through its Admiral Nurses, who are registered nurses and dementia experts. Dementia UK and its Admiral Nurses also provide training for professionals who work with people with dementia. If you are looking after someone with dementia, it''s important that you know how to get help and support for yourself as well. The Carers Trust is a good place to start looking for information and advice on how to get help and support, and even a break from caring. Alzheimer''s Research UK carries out dementia research, but it also answers questions about dementia and dementia research – including how you and your loved ones can get involved. The charity''s infoline 0300 111 5 111 (open Monday to Friday, 9am-5pm) can provide help and guidance. Social media for people with dementia and their carers Online forums are a great way to share your experiences of caring for someone with dementia, as well as reading what others are going through. If there''s a particular issue you are struggling with, the chances are that someone else has had the same experience. Talking Point is the Alzheimer''s Society''s forum. It has people with dementia sharing their information and advice, and supporting each other. Carers can also turn to online communities on the Carers UK forum and the Carers Trust forum. Dementia books on prescription Reading Well Books on Prescription for dementia offers support for people diagnosed with dementia and their relatives and carers. GPs and other health professionals can recommend titles from a list of 25 books on dementia. The books are available for anyone to borrow for free from their local library. This service is also available to people living without a formal diagnosis, who may be worrying about symptoms of dementia. Read more about the Reading Well Books on Prescription for dementia titles.

It''s a good idea to get professional advice about wills, pensions, how to manage any financial assets you have, and how to ensure any partner or children are protected and financially secure. If you have dementia, you may want to consider appointing a trusted person to manage your money in case you are no longer able to do so yourself. This is called Lasting Power of Attorney, and can also enable the nominated person to make decisions about health and welfare matters on your behalf. If you are looking after someone with dementia, you may find yourself helping them manage their daily finances and paying their bills. This may be dependent on the person''s disability or mental capacity, and should be discussed with them in advance. Benefits for people with dementia If you care for someone with dementia, check you are both getting all the benefits and tax credits you are entitled to. For example, you may be able to claim Personal Independence Payment or Attendance Allowance for the person with dementia, and Carer''s Allowance for the carer. You or the person you look after may be entitled to a discount on your council tax. To find out more, read the Money Advice Service''s information on managing money when someone is in ill health. You can get advice and help about claiming benefits from your local social security office, voluntary organisations and support groups. Dealing with bank accounts for someone with dementia If you have Power of Attorney or have been made an appointee or deputy, you may be able to manage someone''s banking activities. For this to happen, you need to have had your power of attorney registered to be recognised as a person''s appointee or deputy. The bank or building society will require proof of your legal standing on managing someone''s finances before they allow you access. They will also need to see proof of the name and address of the person you are caring for. Restrictions may be in place regarding how you are able to manage the account. For example, if someone has been made an appointee, they can only deal with money from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). You can also apply for a third party mandate to deal with a bank, building society or other financial account on someone''s behalf. This allows you to deal with someone else''s banking for them in branch if they cannot attend the bank themselves. Contact the account holder''s bank for more information about setting up a third party mandate. Read more about informal help to manage your money from the Money Advice Service.

You may feel hazy or groggy as you come round from the anaesthetic. A nurse will give you oxygen (through tubes or a mask) to help you feel better. It''s common to feel sick or vomit after you''ve been given anaesthesia. Your nurse may offer you medicine to help relieve this discomfort. You may also have a sore throat and dry mouth. Your blood pressure will be taken via an automatic cuff that squeezes tightly at regular times. Your temperature will also be taken. The outcome of your operation It''s important to find out how well your operation went. Here are some questions you may want to ask: Was the operation as successful as expected? What effect has the operation had on my condition? How will I expect to feel when I get home? How long will it be before I''m back to normal? Managing pain Tell your nurse as soon as you start to feel any pain, so they can give you painkilling medication as soon as possible, to stop it getting worse (the medication can take 20 minutes to start working). Avoiding blood clots The sooner you start to move around, the better. Lying in bed for too long can cause some of your blood to pool in your legs. This puts you at risk of a blood clot. If possible, doing some leg exercises can help to prevent a blood clot. These may be as simple as flexing your knee or ankle and rotating your foot. You may be given special support stockings to wear after surgery to help your blood circulation. Your nurse or doctor will explain how you should use these. Some people are given an injection to thin the blood slightly to help reduce the risk of clots. Enhanced recovery Research shows the earlier you get out of bed and start walking, eating and drinking after your operation, the better. Your hospital may offer an enhanced recovery programme if you''ve had major surgery. This rehabilitation programme aims to get you back to full health quickly, which means you could go home sooner than traditionally expected. Plan for your days following surgery It''s important to arrange for appropriate care following your operation. For elderly people, it''s important to arrange for suitable equipment and care. You shouldn''t be afraid to ask for things that may help you, such as a wheelchair or walking frame. Discharge Before you leave hospital you may (depending on the type of operation you had) have an appointment with a physiotherapist, who will be able to advise you about any exercises you need to carry out. You''ll also be given advice about how to care for your wound, a dose of painkillers, and any equipment you may require, such as dressings, bandages, crutches and splints. Each hospital will have its own policy and arrangements for discharging patients. Your discharge will be affected by: how quickly your health improves while you''re in hospital what support you''ll need after you return home You may want to ask some questions before you leave hospital, such as: Who should I call if I have any concerns once I''m home? What should I be trying to do on my own – for example, going to the bathroom and getting out of bed? Is there anything I should avoid doing? When can I go back to work? How much pain, bruising or swelling should I expect when I get home? When and where will any stitches be removed? Do I need to return to hospital or my GP for follow-up? If so, when will this be? Read more about leaving hospital. Transport home You won’t be able to drive yourself home after surgery. Instead, you could ask someone to pick you up or take you home in a taxi. It''s a good idea to have an adult available to help you for at least 24 hours after surgery. What happens next? See the page on getting back to normal for information and advice on recovering from an operation at home. Page last reviewed: 15/01/2015 Next review due: 01/09/2017', -936571195),

Although having dementia can reduce a person’s ability to live independently, there is a variety of support available to help them. If you care for someone with dementia and want to help them to continue to live at home, you can find advice and resources below in the following areas: Watch this video from the Alzheimer’s Society featuring 92-year-old Rose, who has dementia and lives in her own flat, supported by family and carers. Feeding Dressing Washing and bathing  Moving and handling Mobility Safety in the home  Telecare technology Advance care planning Support services that can help people with dementia For some people with dementia, a valuable form of help could come from a paid careworker to come in to their home to help out with practical, hands-on tasks, such as cleaning, cooking, shopping and personal care. For more information, read about possible care services in your home.  Support can also come in the form of assistance from the local authority, such as a Meals on Wheels service or laundry and library services. Ask your local authority for more details.  Helping someone with dementia to feed themselves When it comes to mealtimes, a person with dementia may stop recognising the food in front of them. They may also struggle to use a knife and fork if their dementia affects their physical co-ordination, and find it hard to chew or swallow food. Further behaviour problems can result in the person with dementia refusing help with eating. These factors can result in a limited diet for someone with dementia, which, in extreme cases, can lead to malnutrition. However, there are steps that can be taken to prevent this from happening. For tips on supporting a person with dementia at mealtimes and an explanation of why changes in eating habits can occur, read this factsheet from Alzheimer’s UK about eating and drinking. Read more about supporting someone who has nutrition and feeding problems. Dressing someone with dementia As dementia progresses, a person’s concentration and co-ordination decreases and they need more help with dressing. It’s important that they are able to carry on deciding what they wear for as long as possible, but if they do need help, try to offer it with tact and sensitivity. Make sure the person with dementia wears clothes that are suitably warm or cool, depending on the weather, that they have on layers if necessary and that they are dry. If you’re helping them to buy new clothes, encourage them to choose clothes that are easier to manage – for example, clothes that have poppers instead of buttons. Read this factsheet on dressing from the Alzheimer’s Society, which includes tips for helping someone to dress and helping them to choose comfortable clothing. Helping someone with dementia to wash and bathe For most adults, washing is a personal and private activity, so it can be hard for the person with dementia to adjust to having someone help them with this. It can also be challenging for you as a carer to adjust to this level of caring, if you’re new to it. Try to approach it in a positive and open-minded way, as this will help to prevent it from being a difficult experience for either of you. There are also practical things to consider. A person might have difficulty getting in and out of the bath, lose recognition of the importance of personal hygiene, or resist help because of a desire for dignity and autonomy. Read advice about looking after someone else''s personal hygiene, including tips for washing, bathing, bed baths and more.   This factsheet from the Alzheimer’s Society on washing and bathing has tips for helping someone to wash, including encouraging independence and creating a relaxing environment. Help with sitting, standing, moving and lifting If you care for someone with advanced dementia, there will be many situations where you will need to physically handle them – for example, to help them in and out of bed, the bath, going to the toilet, or perhaps to lift them up if they have fallen. However, unless you take the necessary precautions while lifting or moving someone, you may be at risk of injury. Read this advice on the best approaches to moving and handling someone with a mobility problem, including lifting techniques. If you start having to move someone regularly because they are unable to move themselves, contact your local authority to ask for a care and support needs assessment for the person with dementia. This is the best way to access help, equipment and training for moving a person. Mobility problems in dementia If the person with dementia develops mobility problems, they may benefit from using a wheelchair outside the home. They are more likely to need an attendant-propelled wheelchair, in which case, as a carer, you will need to consider what works for you as well as the person sitting in it. This includes issues such as whether you want a wheelchair that can be folded to fit into a car. Follow these tips on choosing a wheelchair. Safety at home and dementia Someone with dementia is more at risk of being involved in accidents at home, particularly as the dementia progresses. This is because their sense of balance and ability to react quickly is reduced. Their memory and judgement are also both increasingly affected. Stress and confusion experienced by the person with dementia, or tiredness on the part of their carers, can also increase the chances of an accident occurring. Furthermore, having memory loss and difficulty learning new things means that someone with dementia may forget where they are, where things are and how things work. For all these reasons, it’s worth taking simple steps to help the person with dementia to navigate their home more easily and safely. But try not to make major changes overnight, as this can be alarming or upsetting to the person with dementia. Read this factsheet from the Alzheimer’s Society about safety in the home. It includes tips on avoiding accidents by looking at areas such as lighting, equipment, dangerous substances and te risk of fire at home. Installing specialist equipment and facilities can go a long way towards helping someone with dementia to continue living at home safely. Read this factsheet from the Alzheimer’s Society about equipment, adaptations and improvements to the home. The best way to get this equipment is by getting a care and support needs assessment for the person you''re looking after. How telecare technology can help with dementia Telecare is a term used to describe personal alarms and health-monitoring devices that can help people with disabilities and long-term conditions to live more independently. Telecare can be particularly helpful if you’re caring for someone with dementia. Telecare and telehealth services can give peace of mind to the person with dementia and their relatives, by confirming that they are safe at home and their health is stable. For example, telecare can help reassure you – from a distance – that the person you care for has got out of bed (through a bed pressure sensor) but hasn’t left the house (front door sensor). Find out more about telecare and telehealth, including what’s available on the NHS. Read this factsheet from the Alzheimer’s Society about devices to help with everyday living, including sensors for gas leaks or falls. Advance care planning for people with dementia "Advance care planning" is a way to make sure that people get the support they want. Advance care planning means that everyone involved in looking after someone with dementia, including doctors, care workers, family carers and the person themselves, needs to think about, discuss and then record the person’s wishes regarding their ongoing care. By ensuring that everyone understands what the person''s preferences are, it is more likely that the person will be supported as they would like to be, even if they are unable to say this in the future. This is particularly important for someone with dementia, as it can reduce anxiety, which can be a cause of challenging behaviour.

Dementia: Singing for the Brain Media last reviewed: 03/05/2016 Next review due: 03/05/2018 Dementia can affect all aspects of a person''s life, as well as their family''s. If you have been diagnosed with dementia, or you are caring for someone with the condition, remember that there is advice and support available to help you live well. Even if you have suspected for a while that you or someone you love might have dementia, the diagnosis may come as a shock. People with dementia shouldn''t simply stop doing what they enjoy in life; instead, they should try to remain as independent as possible and continue to enjoy their usual activities. Read about staying independent with dementia.  The symptoms of dementia will usually get gradually worse. How quickly this occurs will depend on the general health of the person with dementia and on the type of dementia they have. Over time, people with dementia will need help to cope at home, and they may even need residential care in a nursing home eventually. It is natural to feel worried about the future, but you are not alone – whether you have dementia or you care for someone with the condition. NHS social services and voluntary organisations can all provide advice and support to help you and your family. Look after your health when you have dementia Living a healthy lifestyle is important for everyone, including people with dementia, and is the best way to help prevent dementia. Eating well and exercising are important for everyone. Changes in eating habits can occur, particularly if someone with dementia is struggling to find the words to ask for food, which can result in weight loss and poor nutrition. The Live Well section of NHS Choices has health and wellbeing advice for everyone. Maintaining a social life when you have dementia It’s easy to feel isolated and alone if you or someone you care for has dementia. Keeping in contact with others is good for people with dementia, because it helps them to keep active and stimulated. Some people find it difficult to talk about their own or a family member’s dementia, or want to help but don’t know how. If a friend or family member finds it hard to talk to you, make the first move and explain that you still need to see them and tell them how they can help you. You may also find it helpful to join a local group of people with dementia and their families. You may not be someone who would normally join a group, but being part of a community of people with dementia, or a group for families who have a member with dementia, can be helpful. You can share experiences and gain insight and useful tips from others who are going through or have been through similar situations. Read more about activities for people with dementia, and communicating with someone with dementia. Practical tips to help if you have dementia: Keep a diary and write down things you want to remember. Pin a weekly timetable to the wall. Put your keys in an obvious place, such as a large bowl in the hall Have a daily newspaper delivered to remind you of the date and day. Put labels on cupboards or drawers. Place helpful telephone numbers by the phone. Write reminders to yourself – for example, put a note on the front door to take your keys. Programme people’s names and numbers into your phone. Install safety devices, such as gas detectors and smoke alarms. Put bills on direct debits, so you don''t forget to pay them. A pill organiser box can be helpful for remembering which medications to take and when.  Ways to combat sleep problems in dementia People with dementia often experience disturbed sleep. They may wake up during the night or be restless. These problems may get worse as the illness progresses. People with dementia may also have painful illnesses, such as arthritis, that cause, or contribute to, sleep problems. Some medication can cause sleepiness during the day and interfere with sleep at night. Sleeping pills can be used with care in people with dementia. However, "sleep hygiene" measures are best. These rules include having no naps during the day, keeping regular bedtimes and avoiding alcohol or caffeine at night. Mood and dementia People with dementia can experience mood swings. They can feel sad or angry at times, or scared and frustrated as the disease progresses. If you or a family member have dementia, you may find it difficult to stay positive. Remember that you are not alone and that help and support are available. Talk to someone about your worries. This could be a family member or friend, a member of your local dementia support group or your GP, who can refer you to a counsellor in your area. If you are struggling to cope with low mood, stress or anxiety, you might find the Moodzone helpful. It contains practical, easy-to-understand information and advice on how to deal with mood-related problems. If you think someone with dementia is experiencing clinical depression, be sure to mention it to their GP. Keeping active and occupied when you have dementia People with dementia should continue to enjoy their hobbies and interests as far as possible. These activities may keep a person with dementia alert and stimulated, so that they maintain an interest in life. Don''t rule out an activity simply because you or your family member have dementia. Activities may change as the illness gets worse, but people with dementia can and should continue to enjoy their spare time. Self care in dementia Self care is an integral part of daily life and involves taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing with the support of those involved in your care. It includes the actions you take every day to stay fit, maintain good physical and mental health, and prevent illness or accidents, as well as the effective care of minor ailments and long-term conditions. People living with long-term conditions can benefit enormously from receiving self care support. They can live longer, have less pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue, have a better quality of life, and be more active and independent. Read more about self care.

That''s why it''s important to get an early diagnosis and start making plans for the future as soon as possible. These plans should include ensuring your wishes are upheld should you not be able to make decisions for yourself – also called lacking or impaired "capacity". Consent to treatment if your capacity is impaired by dementia The Mental Capacity Act is designed to protect people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions for themselves. Under the Act, a person is presumed to have capacity "unless all practical steps to help him (or her) to make a decision have been taken without success".  Find out more about the Mental Capacity Act. Giving your consent means you must give express permission before any medical treatment can be carried out on you. Consent is needed for all treatments, whether it''s a simple blood test or an organ donation. The only time when treatment can go ahead without your permission is if you cannot make a decision on your own and the doctors responsible for your care believe that treatment is in your best interests.  Find out more about consent issues. Power of attorney for people with dementia There may be a time in the future when your symptoms mean you are no longer able to give consent. You may wish to give a relative you trust the power to make decisions about you if you are unable to. This is known as power of attorney. There are three different types of power of attorney: Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) for matters relating to property and financial affairs LPA for matters relating to the person''s welfare (including their health) Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA). EPAs made before October 1 2007 are still valid and can only be registered if the person is losing, or has lost, their mental capacity, and must be registered by the attorney The LPA has to be made in a fixed legal way and is not legally recognised until it is registered with the Office of the Public Guardian. The person making a power of attorney for property and affairs can register the LPA while they are able to make decisions for themselves. A personal welfare LPA may only be registered when a person has lost capacity. Separate powers of attorney can be made for either LPA, or both LPAs can be appointed to the same attorney. Read more about dementia and your money. Advance care planning in dementia After you''re first diagnosed with dementia, you might want to consider drawing up an advance decision. An advance care plan makes your treatment preferences known now in case you are unable to do this in the future. Subjects covered by an advance decision can include: what treatment you would consider having, and in what circumstances what types of treatment you would never wish to have, no matter the circumstances what type of end of life care you would wish to have – for example, whether you would want to be resuscitated by artificial means, such as having a breathing tube inserted into your neck if you have lung failure whether you would be willing to donate organs after your death You cannot request anything illegal in your advance decision, such as assisted suicide. Your care team will be able to provide you with more information and advice about advance decisions. Wills A will lets you decide what happens to your assets (your money, property and possessions) after your death. It''s the best way of ensuring your wishes are carried out the way you want when you die. If you die without making a will, the government will decide what happens to your assets. You can write your will yourself, but it''s a good idea to get legal advice. It will need to be formally witnessed and signed to make it legally valid. GOV.UK recommends that when writing your will, it should include: who you want to benefit from your will who should look after any children aged under 18 who is going to sort out your estate and carry out your wishes after your death (your executor) what happens if the people you want to benefit die before you You should keep your will safe and tell your executor where it is.  For more information, read GOV.UK advice on writing your will or go to Citizens Advice.

You shouldn’t be discharged from hospital until: You are medically fit (this can only be decided by the consultant or someone the consultant has said can make the decision on their behalf). You have had an assessment to look at the support you need to be discharged safely. You have been given a written care plan that sets out the support you’ll get to meet your assessed needs.  The support described in your care plan has been put in place and it’s safe for you to be discharged. Each hospital has its own discharge policy. You should be able to get a copy of this from the ward manager or the hospital’s Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS). A hospital’s discharge policy should state how patients and carers are involving in discharge planning. You can decide whether you want a family carer involved in decisions about your future care. If you have limited capacity to make your own decision, the Mental Capacity Act will apply. It is worth thinking about appointing a deputy or enacting a welfare power of attorney before you go into hospital. Before you go into hospital If you’re due to go into hospital in a planned way, such as for an operation, planning for what happens afterwards should happen before you ever arrive at the hospital. For unplanned admissions, such as if you’ve had a fall and hurt yourself, discharge planning should begin on the day you’re admitted to hospital. You’ll usually be given an estimated date of discharge within 24 to 48 hours of being admitted to hospital. Your progress will be reviewed and, if there’s likely to be a change to your discharge date, you should be kept updated. Read more about what happens after surgery. The person co-ordinating your discharge for should be available each day, and you should be given their name and details of how to contact them. They are sometimes called "discharge co-ordinators" or "ward co-ordinators". Hospital discharge assessment and care plan A discharge assessment looks at the needs you are likely to have when you’re discharged or transferred from hospital. Many people only need a small amount of support when they leave hospital, but others will need a more comprehensive package of care. If you are likely to have ongoing health and social care needs when you leave hospital, the assessment may be carried out by a multidisciplinary team of health or social care professionals. Depending on your needs, the multidisciplinary team could include a social worker, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, mental health nurse or dietitian. You should be fully involved in the assessment process, and your views should be listened to. With your permission, any family carers will also be kept informed and given the opportunity to contribute. If you would like help putting your views across, an independent advocate (for example, from a charity such as Age UK) may be able to help. A care plan will be drawn up, detailing the health and social care support for you, and you should be fully involved. The care plan should include details of: the treatment and support you will get when you’re discharged  who will be responsible for providing support, and how to contact them when, and how often, support will be provided  how the support will be monitored and reviewed  the name of the person who is co-ordinating the care plan  who to contact if there’s an emergency or if things don’t work as they should  information about any charges that will need to be paid (if applicable) What might be in a care plan? The types of support in someone’s care plan will depend on their assessed needs and preferences. A care plan could include: Community care services from the local authority, such as reablement services: An assessment for these must be arranged if it seems that you may need them. NHS continuing healthcare. NHS funded nursing care. Intermediate care: This is short-term care that’s provided free of charge for people who no longer need to be in hospital but may need extra support to help them recover. It lasts for a maximum of six weeks and can be provided in someone’s home or in a residential setting. Other NHS services, such as rehabilitation or palliative care.   Equipment such as wheelchairs, specialist beds, or aids and adaptations for daily living. Support from voluntary agencies: Some organisations such as Age UK and the Red Cross provide "home from hospital" services that can help with household tasks or shopping while you settle back home.  Care and support that’s paid for privately. This may be an option you aren’t eligible for help from the local authority. Carers’ involvement in hospital discharge If someone you know is in hospital and about to be discharged, you should not be put under pressure to accept a caring role or take on more than you’re already doing if you are already their carer. You should be given adequate time to consider whether or not this is what you want or are able to do. If necessary, you should ask for other arrangements to be made while you are reaching a decision. If you decide that you are going to provide care for the person who is being discharged from hospital, you’re entitled to your own carer’s assessment from social services. It is possible that your carer’s assessment will be done over a period of time, beginning before the person you''re looking after is discharged from hospital and continuing once they are home. When you are discharged from hospital On the day of discharge, the person co-ordinating the discharge should make sure that: you (and a carer if you have one) have a copy of the care plan  transport is arranged to get you home any carers will be available if needed  your GP is notified in writing you have any medication or other supplies you’ll need  you’ve been trained how to use any equipment, aids or adaptations needed you have appropriate clothes to wear   you have money and keys for your home If you are being discharged to a care home, the care home should also be told the date and time of your discharge, and have a copy of the care plan. After discharge from hospital Your care should be monitored and reviewed as set out in your care plan. The care plan should also include details of who to contact if things don’t work as planned. If your care plan includes community care services from a local authority, it should check that their care package is working well within two weeks of discharge. If you live alone, this should take place within the first few days of discharge. Following this, your care plan should be reviewed at least annually. Complaints about hospital discharge You might not be happy with the way your discharge from hospital is being handled. For example, if: the hospital plans to discharge you before you think it’s safe there isn’t enough support in your care plan you don’t think your discharge assessment and care planning was carried out correctly If you are in this situation or you have concerns about someone else who is still in hospital, it’s best to raise them straight away so that they can be addressed as soon as possible. Speak to the person who is co-ordinating the discharge, or the supervising consultant. You may find it helpful to get support from the hospital’s Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) or your local Independent Health Complaints Advocacy service. If you want to complain about how a hospital discharge was handled, you could start by speaking to the staff involved to see if the problem can be resolved informally.

What is "capacity"? "Capacity" means the ability to use and understand information to make a decision, and communicate any decision made. A person lacks capacity if their mind is impaired or disturbed in some way, and this means the person is unable to make a decision at that time. Examples of how a person''s brain or mind may be impaired include: mental health conditions – such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder dementia severe learning disabilities brain damage – for example, from a stroke or other brain injury physical or mental conditions that cause confusion, drowsiness or a loss of consciousness intoxication caused by drug or alcohol misuse Someone with such an impairment is thought to be unable to make a decision if they can''t: understand information about the decision remember that information use that information to make a decision communicate their decision by talking, using sign language or by any other means  How capacity is assessed As capacity can sometimes change over time, it should be assessed at the time that consent is required. This will usually be done by an appropriately trained and experienced health professional who is either: recommending the treatment or investigation involved in carrying it out If the health professional feels you have the capacity to give your consent, your decision will be accepted and your wishes will continue to be respected, even if you lose capacity at a later stage. If the health professional feels you don''t currently have the capacity to give consent, and you haven''t made an advance decision or formally appointed anyone to make decisions for you, they''ll need to carefully consider what''s in your best interests before making a decision. Respecting personal beliefs If someone makes a decision about treatment that other people would consider to be irrational, it doesn''t necessarily mean they have a lack of capacity, as long as they understand the reality of their situation. For example, a person who refuses to have a blood transfusion because it''s against their religious beliefs wouldn''t be thought to lack capacity. They still understand the reality of their situation and the consequences of their actions. However, someone with anorexia who is severely malnourished and rejects treatment because they refuse to accept there''s anything wrong with them would be considered incapable. This is because they''re regarded as not fully understanding the reality of their situation, or their consequences. Determining a person''s "best interests" If an adult lacks the capacity to give consent, a decision on whether to go ahead with the treatment will need to be made by the health professionals treating them. To make a decision, the person''s "best interests" must be considered. There are many important elements involved in trying to determine what a person''s best interests are, including: considering whether it''s safe to wait until the person can give consent, if it''s likely they could regain capacity at a later stage involving the person in the decision as much as possible trying to identify any issues the person would take into account if they were making the decision themselves, including religious or moral beliefs; these would be based on views the person expressed previously, as well as any insight close relatives or friends can offer If a person is felt to lack capacity, and there''s no one suitable to help make decisions about medical treatment, such as family members or friends, an independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA) must be consulted. Involving the Court of Protection In situations where there''s serious doubt or dispute about what''s in an incapacitated person''s best interests, healthcare professionals can refer the case to the Court of Protection for a ruling. This is the legal body that oversees the operation of the Mental Capacity Act (2005). Situations that must always be referred to the courts include: sterilisation for contraceptive purposes donation of organs or regenerative tissue, such as bone marrow withdrawal of nutrition and hydration from a person who''s in a permanent vegetative state or minimally conscious state Changes in capacity A person''s capacity to consent can change. For example, they may have the capacity to make some decisions but not others, or their capacity may come and go. In some cases, people can be considered capable of deciding some aspects of their treatment but not others. For example, a person with severe learning difficulties may be capable of deciding on their day-to-day treatment, but incapable of understanding the complexities of their long-term treatment. Some people with certain health conditions may have periods when they''re capable and periods when they''re incapable. For example, a person with schizophrenia may have psychotic episodes (when they can''t distinguish between reality and fantasy), during which they may not be capable of making certain decisions. A person''s capacity can also be temporarily affected by: shock panic fatigue (extreme tiredness) medication Advance decisions and power of attorney If a person knows their capacity to consent may be affected in the future, they can choose to draw up a legally binding advance decision (also known as a living will). This sets out the procedures and treatments that a person refuses to undergo. You can also choose to formally arrange for someone, often a close family member, to have lasting power of attorney (LPA) if you wish to anticipate your loss of capacity to make important decisions at a later stage. Someone with LPA can make decisions about your health on your behalf, although you can choose to specify in advance certain treatments that you would like them to refuse.

Living with dementia Media last reviewed: 14/07/2015 Next review due: 14/07/2017 If someone you know is becoming increasingly forgetful, you should encourage them to see their GP to talk about the early signs of dementia.  Dementia is a group of related symptoms that indicate problems with the brain. One of the most common symptoms of dementia is memory loss. There are other reasons someone might be experiencing memory loss. However, if dementia is detected early, in some cases its progress can be slowed, and the person affected may maintain their mental function. Be aware of the signs of dementia Memory loss is one of the key symptoms, but others include: increasing difficulty with tasks and activities that require concentration and planning depression changes in personality and mood periods of mental confusion difficulty finding the right words If you know someone who is experiencing these symptoms, encourage them to see their GP as soon as possible. Dementia is diagnosed by doctors ruling out other conditions that could cause the symptoms. A GP will run a series of tests and assessments to see if there is an alternative explanation for the problems. The doctor may also want to discuss the problems being experienced to see how they have developed over time. Read more about the symptoms of dementia and related diseases, and how dementia is diagnosed. Talking to someone you think has signs of dementia Raising the issue of memory loss – and the possibility of dementia – can be a difficult thing to do. Someone who is experiencing these symptoms may be confused, worried or in denial. To get someone talking when you''re worried about their memory, the Alzheimer''s Society suggests that you: have the conversation in a familiar, non-threatening environment explain why talking is important and say you''re worried because you care use examples to make things clearer: it''s important not to create a sense of "blame" – for example, instead of telling someone they couldn''t make a cup of tea, you could suggest that they seem to find it difficult to make a cup of tea have an open conversation, and be honest and direct – for example, ask how they''re feeling about their memory make a positive plan of action together You can read more top tips for talking about dementia on the Alzheimer''s Society website. A dementia diagnosis can come as a shock, but over time some people come to view it in a positive way. This is because a diagnosis is the first step towards getting the information, help and support needed to manage the symptoms. A diagnosis of dementia can help people with these symptoms, and their families and friends, take control, make plans and prepare for the future.

(427, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Consent-to-treatment/Pages/Introduction.aspx', NULL, 'Consent to treatment - NHS Choices', 'Consent to treatment  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', '  Consent to treatment is the principle that a person must give permission before they receive any type of medical treatment, test or examination. This must be done on the basis of an explanation by a clinician. Consent from a patient is needed regardless of the procedure – whether it''s a physical examination, organ donation or something else. The principle of consent is an important part of medical ethics and the international human rights law. This topic covers: Defining consent How consent is given Consent from children and young people When consent isn''t needed Consent and life-sustaining treatment Complaints Defining consent For consent to be valid, it must be voluntary and informed, and the person consenting must have the capacity to make the decision. These terms are explained below: Voluntary – the decision to either consent or not to consent to treatment must be made by the person themselves, and must not be influenced by pressure from medical staff, friends or family. Informed – the person must be given all of the information in terms of what the treatment involves, including the benefits and risks, whether there are reasonable alternative treatments and what will happen if treatment doesn''t go ahead. Capacity – the person must be capable of giving consent, which means they understand the information given to them, and they can use it to make an informed decision. If an adult has the capacity to make a voluntary and informed decision to consent to or refuse a particular treatment, their decision must be respected. This is still the case even if refusing treatment would result in their death, or the death of their unborn child. If a person doesn''t have the capacity to make a decision about their treatment, the healthcare professionals treating them can go ahead and give treatment if they believe it''s in the person’s best interests. However, the clinicians must take reasonable steps to seek advice from the patient’s friends or relatives before making these decisions. Read more about assessing the capacity to consent. How consent is given Consent can be given: verbally – for example, by saying they''re happy to have an X-ray in writing – for example, by signing a consent form for surgery Someone could also give non-verbal consent, as long as they understand the treatment or examination about to take place – for example, holding out an arm for a blood test. Consent should be given to the healthcare professional directly responsible for the person''s current treatment, such as: a nurse arranging a blood test a GP prescribing new medication a surgeon planning an operation If someone is going to have a major medical procedure, such as an operation, their consent should ideally be secured well in advance, so they have plenty of time to obtain information about the procedure and ask questions. If they change their mind at any point before the procedure, the person is entitled to withdraw their previous consent. Consent from children and young people If they''re able to, consent is usually given by patients themselves. However, someone with parental responsibility may need to give consent for a child up to the age of 16 to have treatment. Read more about the rules of consent applying to children and young people When consent isn''t needed There are a few exceptions when treatment may be able to go ahead without the person''s consent, even if they''re capable of giving their permission. It may not be necessary to obtain consent if a person: requires emergency treatment to save their life, but they''re incapacitated (for example, they''re unconscious) – the reasons why treatment was necessary should be fully explained once they''ve recovered immediately requires an additional emergency procedure during an operation – there has to be a clear medical reason why it would be unsafe to wait to obtain consent, and it can''t be simply for convenience with a severe mental health condition – such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or dementia – lacks the capacity to consent to the treatment of their mental health (under the Mental Health Act 1983) – in these cases, treatment for unrelated physical conditions still requires consent, which the patient may be able to provide, despite their mental illness requires hospital treatment for a severe mental health condition, but self-harmed or attempted suicide while competent and is refusing treatment (under the Mental Health Act 1983) – the person''s nearest relative or an approved social worker must make an application for the person to be forcibly kept in hospital, and two doctors must assess the person''s condition is a risk to public health (due to rabies, cholera or tuberculosis (TB) is severely ill and living in unhygienic conditions (under the National Assistance Act 1948) – a person who is severely ill or infirm and is living in unsanitary conditions can be taken to a place of care without their consent Consent and life-sustaining treatments A person may be being kept alive with supportive treatments – such as lung ventilation – without having made an advance decision, which outlines the care they would refuse to receive. In these cases, a decision about continuing or stopping treatment needs to be made based on what that person''s best interests are believed to be. To help reach a decision, the healthcare professionals responsible for the person’s care should discuss the issue with the relatives and friends of the person receiving the treatment. They should consider, among other things: what the person''s quality of life will be if treatment is continued how long the person may live if treatment is continued whether there''s any chance of the person recovering Treatment can be withdrawn if there''s an agreement that continuing treatment isn''t in the person''s best interests. The case will be referred to the courts before further action is taken if: an agreement can''t be reached a decision has to be made on whether to withdraw treatment from someone who has been in a state of impaired consciousness for a long time (usually at least 12 months) It''s important to note the difference between withdrawing a person''s life support and taking a deliberate action to make them die. For example, injecting a lethal drug would illegal.

If you are diagnosed with dementia, your future health and social care needs will need to be assessed, and a care plan created to set out how your needs will be met. If you are eligible for help, your social and personal care will come from the social services department of your local authority or council, while the healthcare you need will be provided by the NHS. You may have to pay for all or some of the help arranged by social services, depending on your income and savings, while the NHS care you receive will largely be free. The services you get will depend on your own circumstances and what the local council or NHS is willing to pay for. Social services and dementia Social services can help with your personal care and day-to-day activities. For example, social services may offer to provide home care assistants to help you with washing and dressing, laundry services, meals on wheels, frozen food delivery, aids and adaptations, and help with claiming benefits. An assessment is required to access the services you need. If you haven''t already had an assessment by health and social services, contact your local authority or GP and ask for the social services department to carry out an assessment of your care and support needs. Once you''ve put in your request, a care manager will contact you or your family to carry out a telephone assessment, or to arrange an appointment to see you at home and assess your needs. Read more about finding dementia help and support, and find your local authority. NHS support for dementia NHS help for dementia includes the treatment you receive from your GP and hospital. It can also include other types of healthcare such as community mental health nurses, physiotherapy, audiology (hearing care), optometry (eye tests), podiatry (foot care), speech and language therapy, and mobility specialists. The NHS will also fund any nursing care you receive in a nursing home, although nursing home placement may not be completely free. In some parts of the country, the NHS provides Admiral Nurses in partnership with the charity Dementia UK. Admiral Nurses are NHS specialist dementia nurses who will visit you to give you practical guidance on accessing services as well as offering emotional support. Find out more about Admiral nurses and how they can help. The NHS provides free continuing healthcare, for people with dementia whose care needs relate mainly to their health. If you''re awarded continuing healthcare, the NHS will provide and fund your entire care package – including your healthcare and social care – whether you live in a care home or in your own home. If you live in a care home, NHS continuing healthcare covers your residential costs and your food, as well as any nursing care. To qualify for NHS continuing healthcare, you need to have an individual assessment, this may have already happened. To check whether you''ve had a continuing healthcare assessment, or to request one, contact your local clinical commissioning group (CCG) and ask for the NHS continuing healthcare co-ordinator. Find out more information about CCGs. The Department of Health has produced a booklet, called NHS continuing healthcare and NHS-funded nursing care (PDF, 113kb), for people who may need NHS continuing care, and their families and carers. Tips for getting help and support for dementia Getting help and support for dementia can be made difficult by the memory, functional, and emotional problems caused by dementia. And it can be complicated for carers to act on behalf of a person with dementia. These three tips may help: Keep copies of forms and letters and a record of who you''ve seen. It will help you keep track of your progress and be useful for the health and social care professionals you meet. Be prepared to be persistent to get what you want. Health and social care professionals may not always communicate with each other as well as they should, and you may find you have to explain your situation each time you meet a new professional. Consider using an advocacy organisation. Advocacy organisations can help you access services and give you advice about your rights, particularly if you find meetings and talks with health and social care professionals quite intimidating. The Alzheimer''s Society has a nationwide network of advocates. Page last reviewed: 09/07/2015 Next review due: 09/07/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

Like adults, young people (aged 16 or 17) are presumed to have sufficient capacity to decide on their own medical treatment, unless there''s significant evidence to suggest otherwise. Children under the age of 16 can consent to their own treatment if they''re believed to have enough intelligence, competence and understanding to fully appreciate what''s involved in their treatment. This is known as being "Gillick competent". Read about: Does my child have the right to refuse treatment? Otherwise, someone with "parental responsibility" can consent for them. This could be: the child''s mother or father the child''s legally appointed guardian a person with a residence order concerning the child a local authority designated to care for the child a local authority or person with an emergency protection order for the child Parental responsibility The person with parental responsibility must have the capacity to give consent. If a parent refuses to give consent to a particular treatment, this decision can be overruled by the courts if treatment is thought to be in the best interests of the child. If one person with parental responsibility gives consent and another doesn''t, the healthcare professionals can choose to accept the consent and perform the treatment in most cases. If the people with parental responsibility disagree about what''s in the child''s best interests, the courts can make a decision. In an emergency, where treatment is vital and waiting to obtain parental consent would place the child at risk, treatment can proceed without consent. When consent can be overruled If a young person refuses treatment, which may lead to their death or a severe permanent injury, their decision can be overruled by the Court of Protection.

Telecare in our lives - Tracey and Lynette''s story Media last reviewed: 10/09/2015 Next review due: 10/09/2017 Having a personal alarm fitted can be very useful as they can help you safely remain in your own home. They can help avoid the costly upheaval of moving into sheltered accommodation or a care home. Alarms are worth discussing with your local authority social services department if you are having an assessment of your needs. It may view an alarm as community equipment necessary to meet your assessed care needs, and provide them free of charge after an assessment by an occupational therapist. Alternatively, it should ensure you are left with enough money to pay for any community alarm system after care and support charges have been deducted. If you are going to buy an alarm yourself, you need to consider the many options available to choose from. Some alarms will alert a carer or neighbour. These include: portable alarms – these are battery-powered or use pressurised gas and can be bought from high street shops or online. They are worn or carried and make a high-pitched sound when triggered, which can be heard from a limited distance. fixed position alarms – these have a fixed transmitter and receiver and are operated by a pull cord or similar trigger, which sends a high-pitched sound to alert anyone within a limited distance. Some systems can be designed to release door locks automatically if activated to allow a neighbour to enter the home when the alarm is triggered. portable alarms with a fixed-position receiver – these are worn around the neck or wrist, and the alarm can be triggered by the person wearing them. An alarm is sounded from a receiver mounted on a wall or other fixed position to alert someone within earshot.  portable transmitters and portable receivers – these are worn by carers and the people they are looking after, making it easier for the carer to be aware of when the alarm is triggered. If you''re living with someone else who looks after you, you may want systems that can alert people if you need help when you''re in separate rooms, such as an intercom system. Other typical alarms include: fall alarms – this is a portable device that is activated when the person wearing it falls to a 20 degree angle or more and lies without moving for eight seconds. A signal is sent to a portable pager or an autodial alarm telephone is activated. movement monitors – these are mainly used at night and can alert a carer to epileptic seizures by detecting movement or monitoring vital signs. An alarm is triggered if the sensors notice something is wrong. wandering alarms – most often used to alert a carer when a person strays, this alarm is activated by pressure sensors located in a bedside mat or doorway, or when someone gets out of bed. Some alarms are worn and trigger a warning alarm if the person goes through a door fitted with an antenna. a hypothermia alarm – this is used to monitor room temperature. An alarm is triggered if the temperature falls below a designated level. Gas detectors and smoke or fire detectors are also worth fitting to keep you safe. Telecare at home Telecare systems can help you continue to live independently by allowing someone else – typically a relative who lives elsewhere – to make sure you''re safe. A telecare system is typically made up of a network of sensors that are fitted all around the home. These sensors can be linked through a telephone line to a call centre. Telecare is different from a personal alarm system as you don''t need to do anything to trigger the alarm. It is also different from telehealth systems, which can be used to remotely monitor your health signs, such as blood pressure. Depending on what is needed, the telecare system can also include prompts – for example, giving a reminder to take your medication. Some systems can turn off the electricity or gas mains in the home if they detect danger. If you think you might benefit from a telecare system, contact your local authority''s social services department. Social services can provide telecare system to people who are assessed as needing them and deemed financially eligible for these services. Alternatively, your local NHS trust may pay for a telecare system as part of a continuing healthcare or intermediate care package, if you are eligible. Find out more about NHS Continuing Care. If you can''t get funding from the NHS or your local authority, you may have to pay for a telecare service yourself if you feel you would benefit from it. It''s a good idea to see what telecare systems are available and which are best suited to you and your home. There are telecare demonstrator sites you can visit to see the systems in operation. The Telecare Services Association can help you identify telecare or telehealth services for yourself or your family, friends, or people you provide care for. Which? Elderly Care also has a useful guide to telecare and telehealth systems. Page last reviewed: 15/01/2015 Next review due: 15/01/2017 Share: Save: Print: Ratings How helpful is this page?

(432, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-diagnosis-tests.aspx', NULL, 'Tests for diagnosing dementia - Dementia guide - NHS Choices', '', 'A range of tests and diagnostic procedures is needed to diagnose dementia, but there are several that are fairly commonly used to diagnose dementia. These tests for dementia are mainly tests of mental abilities, blood tests and brain scans. Tests of mental abilities to diagnose dementia People with symptoms of dementia are often given questionnaires to help test their mental abilities, to see how severe any memory problems may be. One widely used test is the mini mental state examination (MMSE). The MMSE assesses a number of different mental abilities, including: short- and long-term memory attention span concentration language and communication skills ability to plan ability to understand instructions The MMSE is a series of exercises, each carrying a score with a maximum of 30 points. These exercises include: memorising a short list of objects and then repeating the list writing a short sentence that is grammatically correct, such as "the dog sat on the floor" correctly answering time-orientation questions, such as identifying the day of the week, the date or the year The MMSE is not a test to diagnose dementia. However, it is useful for assessing the level of mental impairment that a person with dementia may have. Test scores may be influenced by a person''s level of education. For example, someone who cannot read or write very well may have a lower score, but they may not have dementia. Similarly, someone with a higher level of education may achieve a higher score, but still have dementia. Blood tests for dementia A person with suspected dementia may have blood tests to check their overall level of health. These blood tests can also rule out other conditions that may be responsible for their symptoms, such as thyroid hormones and vitamin B12 levels. Read more about blood tests. Dementia brain scans Brain scans are often used for diagnosing dementia once other simpler tests have ruled out other problems. They are needed to check for evidence of other possible problems that could explain a person''s symptoms, such as a major stroke or a brain tumour. A computerised tomography (CT) scan can be used to check for signs of stroke or a brain tumour. However, unlike an MRI scan, a CT scan cannot provide detailed information about the structure of the brain. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to help confirm a diagnosis of dementia. An MRI scan can provide detailed information about the blood vessel damage that occurs in vascular dementia, plus any shrinking of the brain. In frontotemporal dementia, the frontal and temporal lobes are mainly affected by shrinking. Other scans and procedures to diagnose dementia Other types of scan, such as a single photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan or a positron emission tomography (PET) scan, may be recommended if the result of your CT or MRI scan is uncertain. These scans look at how the brain functions and can pick up abnormalities with the blood flow in the brain. In some cases, an electroencephalogram (EEG) may be taken to record the brain''s electrical signals (brain activity).

"Dementia" is the name for problems with mental abilities caused by gradual changes and damage in the brain. It''s rare in people under 65. It tends to develop slowly and get gradually worse over several years. This page covers: Symptoms Getting medical advice Tests and diagnosis Treatments Outlook Causes Symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies People with dementia with Lewy bodies may have: problems with understanding, thinking, memory and judgement – this is similar to Alzheimer''s disease, although memory may be less affected in people with dementia with Lewy bodies periods of fluctuating alertness alternating with periods of confusion or sleepiness – this can change over hours or days slow movement, stiff limbs and tremors (uncontrollable shaking) hallucinations (usually seeing or sometimes hearing things that aren''t there) disturbed sleep, often with violent movements and shouting out fainting spells, unsteadiness and falls These problems can make daily activities increasingly difficult and someone with the condition may eventually be unable to look after themselves. Read more about the symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies. Getting medical advice See your GP if you think you have early symptoms of dementia, especially if you''re over 65 years of age. If you''re worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment with their GP and perhaps suggest that you go with them. Your GP can do some simple checks to try to find the cause of your symptoms and they can refer you to a memory clinic or another specialist for further tests if needed. Read more about getting a dementia diagnosis. Tests for dementia with Lewy bodies There''s no single test for dementia with Lewy bodies. The following may be needed to make a diagnosis: an assessment of symptoms – for example, whether there are typical symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies an assessment of mental abilities – this will usually involve a number of tasks and questions blood tests to rule out conditions with similar symptoms brain scans, such as an MRI scan, CT scan or a single photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) dopamine transporter scan – these can detect signs of dementia or other problems with the brain Read more about the tests used to diagnose dementia. Treatments for dementia with Lewy bodies There''s currently no cure for dementia with Lewy bodies or any treatment that will slow it down. But there are treatments that can help control some of the symptoms, possibly for several years. Treatments include: medicines to reduce hallucinations, confusion, drowsiness, movement problems and disturbed sleep therapies such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy for problems with movement, everyday tasks, and communication psychological therapies, such as cognitive stimulation (activities and exercises designed to improve memory, problem-solving skills and language ability) dementia activities, such as memory cafés (drop-in sessions for people with memory problems and their carers to get support and advice) Read more about how dementia with Lewy bodies is treated.  Outlook for dementia with Lewy bodies How quickly dementia with Lewy bodies gets worse varies from person to person. Home-based help will usually be needed, and some people will eventually need care in a nursing home. The average survival time after diagnosis is similar to that of Alzheimer''s disease – around 6-12 years. But this is highly variable and some people live much longer than this. If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember that you''re not alone. The NHS and social services, as well as voluntary organisations, can provide advice and support for you and your family. Causes of dementia with Lewy bodies Dementia with Lewy bodies is caused by clumps of protein forming inside brain cells. These abnormal deposits are called Lewy bodies. These deposits are also found in people with Parkinson''s disease, and they build up in areas of the brain responsible for functions such as thinking, visual perception and muscle movement. It''s not clear why the deposits develop and how exactly they damage the brain. It''s thought that part of the problem is the proteins affecting the brain''s normal functions by interfering with signals sent between brain cells. Dementia with Lewy bodies usually occurs in people with no family history of the condition, although there have been very rare cases that seem to run in families.

(437, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Rabies/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'rabies', 'Rabies - NHS Choices', 'Rabies  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Rabies is a very serious viral infection that targets the brain and nervous system. You can catch rabies if you are bitten by an infected animal and haven''t been vaccinated. It''s almost always fatal once symptoms develop, but can be prevented if treatment is given promptly after exposure. In the UK, rabies is not found in the animal population (with the exception of bats) and infections are almost always picked up during travel abroad. When to seek medical help Seek immediate medical advice if you''re worried that you or your child may have been bitten, scratched or licked by an animal while abroad, or if you''re bitten or scratched by a bat in any country, including the UK. Although rabies is unlikely, you should also seek immediate medical help if you''re bitten or scratched by a pet that has travelled abroad and has an uncertain vaccination history. If you''ve been bitten or scratched, you should: wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water under a running tap for 15 minutes apply antiseptic or alcohol to clean the wound leave the wound open go to the nearest hospital or medical centre and explain that you''ve been bitten If the incident happens abroad, you should seek local medical help and not wait until you have returned to the UK. How rabies spreads Rabies can be spread to humans from infected animals through a bite, scratch or lick to broken skin, the mouth or the eye. You may also be at risk if an animal spits in your face. In very rare cases, rabies can be spread during an organ transplant. Once it enters the body, the rabies virus multiplies before spreading into nerve endings. It then travels to the spinal cord and brain (the central nervous system). Once the virus is in the central nervous system, it multiplies rapidly and spreads to the salivary glands, lungs, kidneys and other organs. Animals that carry rabies All mammals, including monkeys, can carry the rabies virus, but the following species are more commonly infected: dogs bats raccoons foxes jackals cats mongooses What are the symptoms? It can take a while for symptoms to develop, but when they do the condition is almost always fatal. Symptoms in humans can include: a high temperature (fever) an irrational fear of water (hydrophobia) sensitivity to light (photophobia) fear of drafts of air (aerophobia) confusion or aggressive behaviour Read more about the symptoms of rabies. Treating rabies If you have been exposed (bitten, scratched or licked) by an animal that might have rabies, you''ll need to seek medical advice to determine whether you need to have a course of treatment to prevent rabies. This is known as post-exposure treatment. It''s important this is done before you develop symptoms. Once symptoms develop, the infection cannot be treated and it''s almost always fatal. Post-exposure treatment (preventing rabies) Post-exposure treatment usually involves administering a course of the rabies vaccine, with or without rabies immunoglobulin, in an attempt to prevent the infection spreading to the brain and nervous system. If started promptly, post-exposure treatment is very effective. However, if rabies infection reaches a stage where it causes symptoms, it''s almost always fatal. In these cases, treatment will usually focus on making you as comfortable as possible. Rabies can only be diagnosed once you have developed the disease and get symptoms. Various tests, including a skin biopsy, saliva tests or blood tests, can be used to make the diagnosis. Read more about treating rabies. Vaccination A number of vaccines can be used to prevent a rabies infection developing. Routine (pre-exposure) vaccination is usually only recommended if you regularly work with potentially infected animals or are travelling to a part of the world known to have high levels of rabies and limited medical care. A course of rabies vaccine can also prevent rabies from developing after a potential exposure, provided it is started promptly. Before you travel, you should seek advice about whether you need a rabies vaccination. For more information, visit the Travel Health Pro website. Read more about the rabies vaccination. Avoiding rabies When travelling in countries that aren''t rabies-free, avoid contact with animals and educate your children about the dangers of petting them. Examine your children regularly for cuts and scratches after contact with any animal and ask how they got them. Make sure they know that being bitten or licked by an animal may be dangerous and they need to tell you about it. It''s rare for bat rabies viruses to infect other animals, and the risk of human infection is thought to be low. Nevertheless, if you find an injured bat or a bat that needs to be moved, don''t touch it. Call the Bat Conservation Trust helpline on 0345 1300 228 for advice. Quarantine and the Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) To keep countries rabies-free, it''s important there are strict public health measures to control stray animals such as foxes. The movement of potentially infected animals across borders into uninfected regions is controlled by strictly enforcing quarantine regulations. Animals that don''t have a licence shouldn''t be brought into the UK. The Pet Travel Scheme is a system that allows pet dogs, cats and ferrets from certain countries to enter the UK without going into quarantine as long as they have been vaccinated. It also means people in the UK can take their dogs, cats and ferrets to other European Union (EU) countries and return with them to the UK. More information can be found on the GOV.UK website. How common is human rabies? There are an estimated 60,000 deaths from human rabies each year worldwide. Most cases occur in the developing world, particularly in Africa and Asia. As a result of strict UK quarantine laws regarding transporting animals, as well as the introduction of the Pet Travel Scheme, the UK has been rabies-free since the beginning of the 20th century, with the exception of a rabies-like virus in a single species of bat. There have been no cases of human rabies acquired in the UK since 1902, apart from a case of rabies acquired in a bat-handler from an infected bat in 2002. The last recorded case of rabies in the UK was in 2012. The patient, who died, contracted the disease after being bitten by a dog in India.

The term "dementia" describes a loss of mental ability (cognitive impairment) that is more than would be expected with ageing. It''s enough to affect day-to-day activities and gets progressively worse. Frontotemporal dementia tends to affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain (the front and sides) in particular. These parts of the brain are largely responsible for language and the ability to plan and organise, and are important in controlling behaviour. Frontotemporal dementia often starts at a younger age than usually seen in other types of dementia. Most cases are diagnosed in people aged 50-65, but it can also affect younger or older people. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of frontotemporal dementia vary at first, depending on the exact area of the brain affected. Generally, it causes slowly progressive problems with behaviour, language and thinking. It can profoundly alter a person''s character – for example, they may become impulsive and much more outgoing, or uninterested and lacking initiative. Other typical symptoms include inappropriate behaviour in social situations and progressive difficulty with speech and language. Read more about the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia. What causes frontotemporal dementia?  There are several different causes of frontotemporal dementia, but they all involve a build-up of abnormal proteins in the brain. The abnormal proteins clump together and become toxic to the brain cells, which eventually kills them and causes the affected areas of the brain to shrink over time. It''s not fully understood why these abnormal proteins build up, but there is often a genetic link. Up to 40% of people with frontotemporal dementia have a family history of the condition. Diagnosing frontotemporal dementia See your GP if you think you may have early symptoms of dementia. If you''re worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest going along with them. Your GP can do some simple checks to see if there is a chance you could have dementia, and they can refer you to a specialist if necessary. The specialist will carry out a physical check-up and an assessment of your mental abilities. You may also have blood tests and brain scans. The results of these checks and tests will give your doctor a good idea as to whether your symptoms are caused by frontotemporal dementia, another type of dementia, or something else entirely. Read more about the diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. How frontotemporal dementia is managed There is currently no cure for frontotemporal dementia, nor any medications to slow it down. However, there are treatments and therapies that can help to reduce some of the symptoms. For example, antidepressants may be effective in controlling some of the behavioural problems. Support such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy help people adapt to lost functions. Dementia activities such as "memory cafes" and some psychological therapies can help with managing the symptoms. Read more about treating frontotemporal dementia.  Outlook Frontotemporal dementia gets progressively worse, usually over a number of years. People with the condition can become isolated and socially withdrawn as the illness progresses. They may not want to spend time in the company of others, or when in company, may lack empathy and concern for others, or behave in rude or insulting ways. Some lack the motivation to care for themselves and may need supervision and prompting. Home-based help is often needed, and some people will eventually need residential care in a nursing home.

(439, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/psychosis/pages/introduction.aspx', 'hallucinations', 'Psychosis - NHS Choices', 'Psychosis  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Psychosis is a mental health problem that causes people to perceive or interpret things differently from those around them. This might involve hallucinations or delusions. The two main symptoms of psychosis are: hallucinations – where a person hears, sees and, in some cases, feels, smells or tastes things that aren''t there; a common hallucination is hearing voices delusions – where a person believes things that, when examined rationally, are obviously untrue – for example, thinking your next door neighbour is planning to kill you The combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can often severely disrupt perception, thinking, emotion, and behaviour. Experiencing the symptoms of psychosis is often referred to as having a psychotic episode. What causes psychosis? Psychosis isn''t a condition in itself – it''s triggered by other conditions. It''s sometimes possible to identify the cause of psychosis as a specific mental health condition, such as: schizophrenia – a condition that causes a range of psychological symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions bipolar disorder – a mental health condition that affects mood; a person with bipolar disorder can have episodes of depression (lows) and mania (highs) severe depression – some people with depression also have symptoms of psychosis when they''re very depressed Psychosis can also be triggered by traumatic experiences, stress, or physical conditions, such as Parkinson''s disease, a brain tumour, or as a result of drug misuse or alcohol misuse. How often a psychotic episode occurs and how long it lasts can depend on the underlying cause. For example, schizophrenia can be long term, but most people can make a good recovery and about a quarter only have a single psychotic episode. Episodes related to bipolar disorder usually resolve, but may recur. Read more about the causes of psychosis. Diagnosing psychosis You should see your GP immediately if you''re experiencing psychotic episodes. It''s important psychosis is treated as soon as possible as early treatment usually has better long-term outcomes. Your GP will look at your symptoms and rule out short-term causes, such as drug misuse. They may ask you some questions to help determine what''s causing your psychosis. For example, they may ask you: whether you''re taking any medication whether you''ve been taking illegal substances how your mood has been – for example, whether you''ve been depressed how you''ve been functioning day-to-day – for example, whether you''re still working whether you have a family history of mental health conditions – such as schizophrenia about your hallucinations – such as whether you''ve heard voices about your delusions – such as whether you feel people are controlling you whether you have any other symptoms Your GP should refer you to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment. Read more about diagnosing psychosis. Treating psychosis Treatment for psychosis involves using a combination of: antipsychotic medication – which can help relieve the symptoms of psychosis psychological therapies – the one-to-one talking therapy cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has proved successful in helping people with schizophrenia; in appropriate cases, family therapy has been shown to reduce the need for hospital treatment in people with psychosis social support – support with social needs, such as education, employment, or accommodation Most people with psychosis who get better with medication need to continue taking it for at least a year. Some people need to take medication long term to prevent symptoms recurring. If a person''s psychotic episodes are severe, they may need to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Read more about the treatment of psychosis. Getting help for others People with psychosis often have a lack of insight. They''re unaware that they''re thinking and acting strangely. Because of their lack of insight, it''s often down to the friends, relatives, or carers of a person affected by psychosis to seek help for them. If you''re concerned about someone you know and think they may have psychosis, you could contact their social worker or community mental health nurse if they''ve previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition. If you think the person''s symptoms are placing them at possible risk of harm, you can: take them to the nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if they agree call their GP or local out-of-hours GP call 999 and ask for an ambulance Read more about how to get help for others. Complications People with a history of psychosis are much more likely to have drug or alcohol misuse problems, or both. This may be because these substances can provide short-term symptom relief, although they usually make symptoms worse in the long term. People with psychosis also have a higher than average risk of suicide. It''s estimated 1 in 5 people with psychosis will attempt to commit suicide at some point in their life, and 1 in 25 people with psychosis will kill themselves. Side effects can also occur if someone is taking antipsychotics on a long-term basis. Weight gain is a common side effect. In rare cases, a person with psychosis may also develop type 2 diabetes.

(440, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/cholera/Pages/definition.aspx', 'cholera', 'Cholera - NHS Choices', 'Cholera  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Cholera is a potentially fatal bacterial infection caused by consuming contaminated food or water. Not everyone who becomes infected will develop symptoms, but those who do will usually experience: severe, watery diarrhoea feeling and being sick stomach cramps These symptoms generally develop within a few days of infection, although they can sometimes occur after just a few hours. Without treatment, the combination of diarrhoea and vomiting can cause a person to quickly become dehydrated and go into shock (where there''s a sudden massive drop in blood pressure). In the most severe cases, cholera can be fatal. At-risk areas Cholera can spread if food and, in particular, water become contaminated with the stools of an infected person. This is why cholera is most widespread in regions of the world with poor sanitation, such as parts of: sub-Saharan Africa south and south-east Asia the Middle East central America and the Caribbean Mass outbreaks of cholera often occur after natural disasters or during war, as a result of overcrowding in poor living conditions and a lack of access to clean water. The World Health Organization estimates that there are 1.4 to 4.3 million cases of cholera worldwide every year. The condition is also responsible for many thousands of deaths. There haven''t been any cases of cholera originating in England and Wales for over 100 years, although travellers do occasionally bring the infection back with them. However, this is rare, with only six cases of cholera reported in England and Wales during 2013/14. Advice for travellers If you''re travelling to parts of the world known to be affected by cholera, you should take some basic precautions to prevent a cholera infection and other causes of travellers'' diarrhoea. For example, you should: only drink water that''s been recently boiled, or drink from a bottle that''s been properly sealed avoid eating ice cream and don''t have ice in your drinks avoid uncooked fruit and vegetables, unless you''ve washed them in safe water or peeled them yourself avoid shellfish, seafood and salads Read more about food and water safety abroad. Cholera vaccination Vaccination against cholera may sometimes be recommended if you''re travelling to areas where the infection is widespread, particularly if you''re an aid worker and likely to have limited access to medical services. You should speak to a nurse or doctor about whether you need a cholera vaccination well in advance of travelling, if you''re considering visiting an area affected by cholera. The cholera vaccine is available as a drink, which is given in two or three separate doses that are taken one to six weeks apart. The vaccine is estimated to be about 85% effective in the months after vaccination, although the level of protection gradually reduces over time and booster doses will eventually be needed if you continue to be at risk. Read more about cholera vaccination. Treating cholera Cholera can be easily treated using oral rehydration solution (ORS) to prevent dehydration and shock. ORS comes as a sachet containing a mixture of salts and glucose, which is dissolved in water. It''s ideal for replacing the fluids and minerals that are lost when a person becomes dehydrated. ORS sachets are available from pharmacists, camping shops and travel clinics. If you''re travelling to regions of the world affected by cholera, you should take ORS sachets with you as a precaution. When a person with cholera is very severely dehydrated, intravenous antibiotics may be recommended to shorten the duration of diarrhoea and speed up rehydration.

(441, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vascular-dementia/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Vascular dementia', 'Vascular dementia - NHS Choices', 'Vascular dementia  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Vascular dementia is a common form of dementia that''s estimated to affect more than 135,000 people in the UK. The term dementia describes a loss of mental ability (cognitive impairment) associated with gradual death of brain cells. It''s rare in anyone younger than 65. Signs and symptoms Many cases of vascular dementia start with early warning signs, including slight: slowness of thought difficulty with planning trouble with language problems with attention and concentration mood or behavioural changes See your GP if you notice these signs. If it''s spotted at an early stage, lifestyle changes and treatment may be able to stop the vascular dementia getting worse, or at least slow its progression. Left untreated, your symptoms may continue to get worse. Read more about the symptoms of vascular dementia. What causes vascular dementia? Vascular dementia is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, which damages and eventually kills the brain cells.  This can develop as a result of: narrowing and blockage of the small blood vessels deep inside the brain (known as small vessel disease) a single large stroke (where the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly cut off) lots of mini-strokes that cause tiny, but widespread, damage to the brain In many cases, these problems are linked to underlying health conditions – such as high blood pressure and diabetes – as well as lifestyle factors, such as smoking and being overweight. This may mean tackling these things might reduce your risk of vascular dementia in later life, as well as other serious problems such as strokes, although it''s not yet clear exactly how much your risk of dementia can be reduced. Read more about the causes of vascular dementia. Diagnosing vascular dementia See your GP if you think you may have early symptoms of dementia. If you''re worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and maybe suggest you go along with them. Your GP can do some simple checks to see if there is a chance you could have dementia, and they can refer you to a specialist if necessary. The specialist will carry out a physical check-up and an assessment of your mental abilities. You may also have blood tests and brain scans. The results of these checks and tests will give your doctor a good idea as to whether your symptoms are caused by vascular dementia, another type of dementia, or something else entirely. Read more about the diagnosis of vascular dementia. How vascular dementia is managed There is no specific treatment for vascular dementia and no way to reverse the damage to the brain that has already occurred. However, treatment may help slow down the progression of the condition. Medicines and lifestyle changes will be recommended to tackle the underlying cause, such as high blood pressure. This includes: eating healthily losing weight, if you are overweight stopping smoking, if you smoke getting fit cutting down on alcohol Support such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy can help people regain lost functions, and dementia activities such as memory cafés and some psychological therapies can help manage symptoms. Read more about treating vascular dementia. Outlook The symptoms of vascular dementia will usually get steadily worse over time. This often happens in sudden steps, with relatively stable periods in between, although it''s difficult to predict when these steps will happen. Although treatment can help, vascular dementia can significantly shorten life expectancy. The average survival time from diagnosis is around four years. Most people will die either from complications of dementia, such as pneumonia, or from a subsequent stroke. If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, you are not alone. The NHS, social services and voluntary organisations will be able to provide advice and support to help you and your family.

As you get older, you may find that memory loss becomes a problem. It''s normal for your memory to be affected by age, stress, tiredness, or certain illnesses and medications. This can be annoying if it happens occasionally, but if it''s affecting your daily life or is worrying you or someone you know, you should seek help from your GP. How common is dementia? According to the Alzheimer''s Society there are around 800,000 people in the UK with dementia. One in three people over 65 will develop dementia, and two-thirds of people with dementia are women. The number of people with dementia is increasing because people are living longer. It is estimated that by 2021, the number of people with dementia in the UK will have increased to around 1 million. What is dementia? Dementia is a common condition. Your risk of developing dementia increases as you get older, and the condition usually occurs in people over the age of 65. Dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) associated with an ongoing decline of the brain and its abilities. This includes problems with: memory loss thinking speed mental agility language understanding judgement People with dementia can become apathetic or uninterested in their usual activities, and have problems controlling their emotions. They may also find social situations challenging, lose interest in socialising, and aspects of their personality may change. A person with dementia may lose empathy (understanding and compassion), they may see or hear things that other people do not (hallucinations), or they may make false claims or statements.  As dementia affects a person''s mental abilities, they may find planning and organising difficult. Maintaining their independence may also become a problem. A person with dementia will therefore usually need help from friends or relatives, including help with decision making. Your GP will discuss the possible causes of memory loss with you, including dementia. Other symptoms can include: increasing difficulties with tasks and activities that require concentration and planning depression changes in personality and mood periods of mental confusion difficulty finding the right words Most types of dementia can''t be cured, but if it is detected early there are ways you can slow it down and maintain mental function. Read more about the symptoms of dementia. Why is it important to get a diagnosis? An early diagnosis can help people with dementia get the right treatment and support, and help those close to them to prepare and plan for the future.

It mainly affects the lungs, but it can affect any part of the body, including the tummy (abdomen) glands, bones and nervous system. TB is a serious condition, but it can be cured if it''s treated with the right antibiotics. This page covers: Symptoms of TB What causes TB? Treating TB Vaccination for TB Countries with high TB rates Symptoms of TB Typical symptoms of TB include: a persistent cough that lasts more than three weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may be bloody weight loss night sweats high temperature (fever) tiredness and fatigue loss of appetite swellings in the neck You should see a GP if you have a cough that lasts more than three weeks or you cough up blood. Read more about the symptoms of TB and diagnosing TB. What causes TB? TB is a bacterial infection. TB that affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) is the most contagious type, but it usually only spreads after prolonged exposure to someone with the illness.  In most healthy people, the body''s natural defence against infection and illness (the immune system) kills the bacteria and there are no symptoms. Sometimes the immune system can''t kill the bacteria, but manages to prevent it spreading in the body. You won''t have any symptoms, but the bacteria will remain in your body. This is known as latent TB. People with latent TB aren''t infectious to others. If the immune system fails to kill or contain the infection, it can spread within the lungs or other parts of the body and symptoms will develop within a few weeks or months. This is known as active TB. Latent TB could develop into an active TB disease at a later date, particularly if your immune system becomes weakened. Read more about the causes of TB. Treating TB With treatment, TB can almost always be cured. A course of antibiotics will usually need to be taken for six months. Several different antibiotics are used because some forms of TB are resistant to certain antibiotics. If you''re infected with a drug-resistant form of TB, treatment with six or more different medications may be needed. If you''re diagnosed with pulmonary TB, you''ll be contagious for about two to three weeks into your course of treatment. You won''t usually need to be isolated during this time, but it''s important to take some basic precautions to stop the infection spreading to your family and friends. You should: stay away from work, school or college until your TB treatment team advises you it''s safe to return always cover your mouth when coughing, sneezing or laughing carefully dispose of any used tissues in a sealed plastic bag open windows when possible to ensure a good supply of fresh air in the areas where you spend time avoid sleeping in the same room as other people  If you''re in close contact with someone who has TB, you may have tests to see whether you''re also infected. These can include a chest X-ray, blood tests, and a skin test called the Mantoux test. Read more about treating TB. Vaccination for TB The BCG vaccine offers protection against TB, and is recommended on the NHS for babies, children and adults under the age of 35 who are considered to be at risk of catching TB. The BCG vaccine isn''t routinely given to anyone over the age of 35 as there''s no evidence that it works for people in this age group. At-risk groups include: children living in areas with high rates of TB people with close family members from countries with high TB rates people going to live and work with local people for more than three months in an area with high rates of TB If you''re a healthcare worker or NHS employee and you come into contact with patients or clinical specimens, you should also have a TB vaccination, irrespective of age, if: you haven''t been previously vaccinated (you don''t have a BCG scar or the relevant documentation), and the results of a Mantoux skin test or a TB interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) blood test are negative Read more about who should have the BCG vaccine.

Dementia is a progressive neurological disease which affects multiple brain functions, including memory. The exact cause of Alzheimer''s disease is unknown, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: increasing age a family history of the condition previous severe head injuries lifestyle factors and conditions associated with cardiovascular disease It''s becoming increasingly understood that it''s very common to have both changes of Alzheimer''s and vascular dementia together (mixed dementia). Read more about the causes of Alzheimer''s disease. Signs and symptoms of Alzheimer''s disease Alzheimer''s disease is a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually and become more severe over the course of several years. It affects multiple brain functions. The first sign of Alzheimer''s disease is usually minor memory problems. For example, this could be forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects. As the condition develops, memory problems become more severe and further symptoms can develop, such as: confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places difficulty planning or making decisions problems with speech and language problems moving around without assistance or performing self-care tasks personality changes, such as becoming aggressive, demanding and suspicious of others hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren''t there) and delusions (believing things that are untrue) low mood or anxiety Read more about the symptoms of Alzheimer''s disease. Who is affected? Alzheimer''s disease is most common in people over the age of 65, and affects slightly more women than men. The risk of Alzheimer''s disease and other types of dementia increases with age, affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80. However, around 1 in every 20 cases of Alzheimer''s disease affects people aged 40 to 65. Receiving a diagnosis As the symptoms of Alzheimer''s disease progress slowly, it can be difficult to recognise that there''s a problem. Many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older. However, a timely diagnosis of Alzheimer''s disease can give you the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support that may help. If you''re worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it''s a good idea to see your GP. If you''re worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. There''s no single test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer''s disease. Your GP will ask questions about any problems you are experiencing and may do some tests to rule out other conditions. If Alzheimer''s disease is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist memory service to:   discuss the process of making the diagnosis organise testing  create a treatment plan   Read more about diagnosing Alzheimer''s disease. How Alzheimer''s disease is treated There''s no cure for Alzheimer''s disease, but medication is available that can help relieve some of the symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition in some people. Various other types of support are also available to help people with Alzheimer''s live as independently as possible, such as making changes to your home environment so it''s easier to move around and remember daily tasks. Psychological treatments such as cognitive stimulation therapy may also be offered to help support your memory, problem solving skills and language ability. Read more about treating Alzheimer''s disease. Outlook On average, people with Alzheimer''s disease live for around 8 to 10 years after they start to develop symptoms. However, this can vary considerably from person to person. Some people with the condition will live longer than this, but others will not. Alzheimer''s disease is a life-limiting illness, although many people diagnosed with the condition will die from another cause. As Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological condition, it can cause problems with swallowing. This can lead to aspiration (food being inhaled into the lungs) which can cause frequent chest infections. It''s also common for people with Alzheimer’s disease to eventually have difficulty eating and to have a reduced appetite.  There''s increasing awareness that people with Alzheimer’s disease need palliative care. This includes support for families, as well as the person with Alzheimer''s. Can Alzheimer''s disease be prevented? As the exact cause of Alzheimer''s disease isn''t clear, there''s no known way to prevent the condition. However, there are things you can do that may reduce your risk or delay the onset of dementia, such as: stopping smoking and cutting down on alcohol eating a healthy, balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight staying physically fit and mentally active These measures have other health benefits, such as lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease and improving your overall mental health.

According to the Alzheimer''s Society there are around 800,000 people in the UK with dementia. One in three people over 65 will develop dementia, and two-thirds of people with dementia are women. The number of people with dementia is increasing because people are living longer. It is estimated that by 2021, the number of people with dementia in the UK will have increased to around 1 million. What is dementia? Dementia is a common condition. Your risk of developing dementia increases as you get older, and the condition usually occurs in people over the age of 65. Dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) associated with an ongoing decline of the brain and its abilities. This includes problems with: memory loss thinking speed mental agility language understanding judgement People with dementia can become apathetic or uninterested in their usual activities, and have problems controlling their emotions. They may also find social situations challenging, lose interest in socialising, and aspects of their personality may change. A person with dementia may lose empathy (understanding and compassion), they may see or hear things that other people do not (hallucinations), or they may make false claims or statements.  As dementia affects a person''s mental abilities, they may find planning and organising difficult. Maintaining their independence may also become a problem. A person with dementia will therefore usually need help from friends or relatives, including help with decision making. Your GP will discuss the possible causes of memory loss with you, including dementia. Other symptoms can include: increasing difficulties with tasks and activities that require concentration and planning depression changes in personality and mood periods of mental confusion difficulty finding the right words Most types of dementia can''t be cured, but if it is detected early there are ways you can slow it down and maintain mental function. Read more about the symptoms of dementia. Why is it important to get a diagnosis? An early diagnosis can help people with dementia get the right treatment and support, and help those close to them to prepare and plan for the future.

(448, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/Pages/challenging-behaviour-carers.aspx?tabname=For%20carers', 'For carers', 'Caring and challenging behaviour - Care and support - NHS Choices', '', 'A person''s behaviour can be defined as "challenging" if it puts them or those around them (such as their carer) at risk, or leads to a poorer quality of life. It can also impact on their ability to join in everyday activities. Challenging behaviour can include aggression, self-harm, destructiveness and disruptiveness. Communication is the main way we interact and express our needs, likes and dislikes. If communication is a problem, it can be very frustrating for the person and may result in challenging behaviour. If this behaviour leads to a desired outcome, it may be repeated again and again. Challenging behaviour is often seen in people with conditions that affect communication and the brain, such as learning disabilities or dementia. What can you do to help? As a carer, try to understand why the person you look after is behaving in this way. For example, they might feel anxious or bored, or in pain. If you can recognise the early warning signs, you may be able to prevent behavioural outbursts. For example, if being in a large group of people makes the person you care for feel anxious and they become agitated, you could arrange for them to be in a smaller group or have one-to-one support. Some people find a distraction can focus a person''s energies elsewhere and prevent them displaying challenging behaviour. The person you care for might behave in a challenging way to get your attention. If this is the case, consider not responding directly to their behaviour – although you shouldn''t ignore them completely. But if their behaviour puts them or someone else at risk, you''ll need to intervene as calmly as possible. Professional help with challenging behaviour If you''re finding it hard to cope with the behaviour of the person you look after, you can ask your GP to refer you to a specialist with knowledge of challenging behaviour. You will usually be asked to keep a record of the person''s behaviour to see if there are any patterns. The specialist will want to know what situations or people trigger the behaviour, what the early warning signs are, and what happens after the event. A specialist will try to find out what the person is aiming for in their challenging behaviour. Do they crave one-to-one attention, or do they want to be removed from a situation they find difficult? If a reason for the behaviour can be established, their needs could be met in an alternative way to prevent them resorting to challenging behaviour. Any techniques you try must be followed consistently by all those involved in the care of the person you look after. If everyone does this, it will help the individual involved to understand what''s expected of them. In extreme circumstances – for example, if the person''s behaviour is harmful to themselves or others and all methods of calming them have been tried – a doctor may prescribe medication. If you''re concerned about the side effects of medication, speak to the person''s GP. Challenging behaviour – help for carers If you care for someone who displays challenging behaviour and you find it difficult to cope, support is available. It is particularly important that you seek support if you are experiencing harm from the person you care for (whether intentional or unintentional). Many organisations for people with learning disabilities or dementia have strategies for coping with challenging behaviour. Some of these organisations also provide opportunities for carers to connect with other people in a similar situation – for example, through family linking schemes. Sharing your experiences – for example, with a local carers'' group – can be a good way of getting support. Contact the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053 or through your carers support group. Respite care for the person you look after enables you to take a break from your caring responsibilities. It''s one of the services your local authority can provide after an assessment for the person you care for, or a carer''s assessment for you. See our pages on Carers'' assessments for more information. Friends and family members can also be an important source of practical and emotional support. Sometimes you may consider "restraining" the person if you believe their behaviour is putting themselves at risk and they don''t have the mental ability or capacity to make a decision. But you should not restrain the person unless it is a reasonable action to take. Find out about Lasting Power of Attorney and restraint. Read about tackling challenging behaviour in children. Carer''s tip from Scope "When faced with someone who is aggressive and shouting, keep your face neutral and lower the volume and pitch of your own voice. Nine times out of ten, they will quieten down to hear what you are saying." Sexually inappropriate behaviour in children Sexual exploration and play is a natural part of childhood sexual development, and helps children to develop physically and emotionally. Throughout their development, every child will express themselves sexually in different ways. A child''s behaviour will depend on their age and circumstances. The NSPCC website describes the behaviours typical of each developmental stage. It is normal to see a child exhibiting behaviour that is slightly more or less mature for their age. Read more about talking to your children about sex and relationships. If you have concerns about a child''s behaviour There are many reasons why children may show sexual behaviour that is inappropriate or unexpected for their age. It could be related to curiosity, anxiety, a traumatic experience, or because of a learning disability or mental health problem. If your child acts inappropriately in public, try to distract them with another activity. This can be a useful way to defuse the situation. If you think your child''s behaviour is related to an illness, speak to the healthcare professionals involved in your child''s care and ask for advice on how to manage their behaviour. They may inform you of local or national organisations that could help. If you are concerned about the safety or welfare of a child, you can contact the NSPCC 24-hour helpline on 0808 800 5000 or email the NSPCC. Sexually inappropriate behaviour in adults who need care Sexually inappropriate behaviour in adults who need care can be a result of a mental health or neurological condition, such as dementia. It may include undressing in public, fondling genitals, or touching someone inappropriately. For more information on sex and disabilities, call the Outsiders website helpline. You may not be able to stop a person engaging in inappropriate sexual behaviour, but there are ways you can address the issue. Think about or ask the person why they are acting in a certain way. For example, if they start to undress in public, are they hot or uncomfortable? React calmly to their behaviour.  Treat the situation with humour, rather than sounding angry.  Distract their attention, rather than being confrontational. If other people are present, you could explain to them that the behaviour is because of an illness and is not directed at them personally. Keep a diary to see if you can find a pattern in their behaviour – for example, whether it is more likely to occur in certain situations, with the same people present, or at certain times of the day or night. If you''re finding it difficult to control the behaviour of the person you look after, speak to social services or their GP.

This affects the heart''s ability to pump blood around the body. Some types of cardiomyopathy are inherited and are seen in children and younger people. This page explains the main types of cardiomyopathy: dilated cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy takotsubo cardiomyopathy or ''broken heart syndrome'' It then explains:  diagnosing cardiomyopathy treating cardiomyopathy information about you Dilated cardiomyopathy In dilated cardiomyopathy the muscle walls of the heart have become stretched and thin, so they can''t contract (squeeze) properly to pump blood around the body. How serious is it? If you have dilated cardiomyopathy, you''re at greater risk of heart failure, where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure. Heart failure typically causes shortness of breath, extreme tiredness and ankle swelling. Learn more about the symptoms of heart failure. There''s also a risk of heart valve problems, an irregular heartbeat and blood clots. You''ll need to have regular appointments with your GP so the disease can be monitored. Who''s affected? Dilated cardiomyopathy can affect both children and adults.  The heart muscle can become stretched if you have an unhealthy lifestyle or an underlying medical condition, or both. The following can all play a role in the disease: uncontrolled high blood pressure an unhealthy lifestyle – such as a lack of vitamins and minerals in the diet, heavy drinking and recreational drug use a viral infection that causes inflammation of the heart muscle   a heart valve problem a disease of the body tissues or vessels – such as Wegener''s granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, lupus, polyarteritis nodosa, vasculitis or muscular dystrophy inheriting a mutated (changed) gene that makes you more vulnerable to the disease pregnancy – cardiomyopathy can sometimes develop as a complication of pregnancy But for many people, the cause is unknown. More information Read the British Heart Foundation''s detailed booklet on living with dilated cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle cells have enlarged and the walls of the heart chambers thicken. The chambers are reduced in size so they can''t hold much blood, and the walls can''t relax properly and may stiffen. How serious is it? Most people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will be able to live a full, normal life. Some people don''t even have symptoms and don''t need treatment. But that doesn''t mean the condition can''t be serious. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden unexpected death in childhood and in young athletes. The main heart chambers can become stiff, leading to back pressure on the smaller collecting chambers. This can sometimes worsen the symptoms of heart failure and lead to abnormal heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation). Blood flow from the heart may become reduced or restricted (known as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Also, the mitral heart valve can become leaky, causing blood to leak backwards. Read more about mitral regurgitation. These heart changes can cause dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath and temporary loss of consciousness. You''ll also be at greater risk of developing endocarditis (a heart infection). If you have severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, you''ll need to see your doctor regularly so your condition can be monitored. Your doctor will advise about the level and amount of exercise you can do and sensible lifestyle changes to make.  Who''s affected? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is thought to affect 1 in 500 people in the UK. Most people inherit the disease from their parents. Read more about how genetic conditions are inherited.   More information Read the British Heart Foundation''s detailed booklet on living with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy is rare and mostly affects older adults. The walls of the main heart chambers become stiffened and rigid and can''t relax properly after contracting. This means the heart can''t fill up properly with blood. It results in reduced blood flow from the heart and can lead to symptoms of heart failure, such as breathlessness, tiredness and ankle swelling, as well as heart rhythm problems. In many cases the cause is unknown, although sometimes it can be inherited. More information Read the American Heart Association''s leaflet on restrictive cardiomyopathy (PDF, 102kb). Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy In arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), the proteins that normally hold the heart muscle cells together are abnormal. Muscle cells can die and the dead muscle tissue is replaced with fatty and fibrous tissue. The walls of the main heart chambers become thin and stretched, and can''t pump blood around the body properly. People with ARVC typically have heart rhythm problems. Reduced blood flow from the heart can also lead to symptoms of heart failure. ARVC is an uncommon inherited condition caused by a mutation (change) in one or more genes. It can affect teenagers or young adults and has been the reason for some sudden unexplained deaths in young athletes. There''s increasing evidence that prolonged, strenuous exercise worsens the symptoms of ARVC. It''s important that people with or at risk of ARVC have a careful discussion about this with their cardiologist. More information Read the British Heart Foundation''s detailed booklet on ARVC. Diagnosing cardiomyopathy Some cases of cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed after various heart scans and tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram. Cardiomyopathy that runs in the family can be diagnosed after a genetic test. If you''ve been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, you may be advised to have a genetic test to identify the mutation (faulty gene) that caused this. Your relatives can then be tested for the same mutation and, if they have it, their condition can be monitored and managed early. Treating cardiomyopathy  There''s no cure for cardiomyopathy, but the treatments described below are usually effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications. Not everyone with cardiomyopathy will need treatment. Some people only have a mild form of the disease that they can control after making a few lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes If the cause of your cardiomyopathy isn''t genetic, it should generally help to: follow a healthy diet and take gentle exercise quit smoking (if you smoke) lose weight (if you''re overweight) avoid or reduce your intake of alcohol  get plenty of sleep manage stress make sure any underlying condition, such as diabetes, is well controlled  Medication Medication may be needed to control blood pressure, correct an abnormal heart rhythm, remove excess fluid or prevent blood clots.  Read about: medication for high blood pressure beta-blockers to treat an irregular heartbeat or heart failure diuretics to remove excess fluid from your body if this has caused swelling anticoagulants such as warfarin to prevent blood clots medication to treat heart failure Hospital procedures In some people with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the septum (the wall dividing the left and right side of the heart) is thickened and bulges into the main heart chamber. They may need to have either: an injection of alcohol into their heart – this is to reduce part of the muscle in the septum a septal myectomy – heart surgery to remove part of the thickened septum (the mitral valve may be repaired at the same time, if necessary) Those with heart rhythm problems may need to have a pacemaker, or a similar device, implanted to control their abnormal heart rhythm. Read more about having a pacemaker fitted. As a last resort, a heart transplant may be necessary. Information about you If you have cardiomyopathy, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. GOV.UK has more information about the register. Broken heart syndrome Some people who sustain significant emotional or physical stress, such as bereavement or major surgery, go on to experience a temporary heart problem. The heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or "stunned", causing the left ventricle (one of the heart''s main chambers) to change shape. It may be caused by a surge of hormones, particularly adrenaline, during this period of stress. The main symptoms are chest pain and breathlessness, similar to those of a heart attack – always call 999 if you or someone else experiences these. The condition – known medically as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or acute stress cardiomyopathy – is temporary and reversible. It''s unusual for it to happen again.

People with bipolar disorder have periods or episodes of: depression – feeling very low and lethargic mania – feeling very high and overactive (less severe mania is known as hypomania) Symptoms of bipolar disorder depend on which mood you''re experiencing. Unlike simple mood swings, each extreme episode of bipolar disorder can last for several weeks (or even longer), and some people may not experience a "normal" mood very often. Depression You may initially be diagnosed with clinical depression before having a future manic episode (sometimes years later), after which you may be diagnosed with bipolar disorder. During an episode of depression, you may have overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, which can potentially lead to thoughts of suicide. If you''re feeling suicidal or having severe depressive symptoms, contact your GP, care co-ordinator or local mental health emergency services as soon as possible. If you want to talk to someone confidentially, call the Samaritans, free of charge, on 116 123. You can talk to them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Alternatively, visit the Samaritans website or email jo@samaritans.org. Mania During a manic phase of bipolar disorder, you may feel very happy and have lots of energy, ambitious plans and ideas. You may spend large amounts of money on things you can''t afford and wouldn''t normally want. Not feeling like eating or sleeping, talking quickly and becoming annoyed easily are also common characteristics of this phase. You may feel very creative and view the manic phase of bipolar as a positive experience. However, you may also experience symptoms of psychosis, where you see or hear things that aren''t there or become convinced of things that aren''t true. Living with bipolar disorder The high and low phases of bipolar disorder are often so extreme that they interfere with everyday life. However, there are several options for treating bipolar disorder that can make a difference. They aim to control the effects of an episode and help someone with bipolar disorder live life as normally as possible. The following treatment options are available: medication to prevent episodes of mania, hypomania (less severe mania) and depression – these are known as mood stabilisers and are taken every day on a long-term basis medication to treat the main symptoms of depression and mania when they occur learning to recognise the triggers and signs of an episode of depression or mania psychological treatment – such as talking therapy, which can help you deal with depression, and provides advice about how to improve your relationships lifestyle advice – such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, as well as advice on improving your diet and getting more sleep It''s thought using a combination of different treatment methods is the best way to control bipolar disorder. Help and advice for people with a long-term condition or their carers is also available from charities, support groups and associations. This includes self-help and self-management advice, and learning to deal with the practical aspects of a long-term condition. Find out more about living with bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder and pregnancy Bipolar disorder, like all other mental health problems, can get worse during pregnancy. However, specialist help is available if you need it. Read more about bipolar disorder in pregnancy. What causes bipolar disorder? The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, although it''s believed a number of things can trigger an episode. Extreme stress, overwhelming problems and life-changing events are thought to contribute, as well as genetic and chemical factors. Who''s affected? Bipolar disorder is fairly common and one in every 100 adults will be diagnosed with the condition at some point in their life. Bipolar disorder can occur at any age, although it often develops between the ages of 15 and 19 and rarely develops after 40. Men and women from all backgrounds are equally likely to develop bipolar disorder. The pattern of mood swings in bipolar disorder varies widely between people. For example, some people only have a couple of bipolar episodes in their lifetime and are stable in between, while others have many episodes. Bipolar disorder and driving If you have bipolar disorder, the condition may impair your driving. You must inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about any medical condition that could affect your ability to drive.

People with schizophrenia usually receive help from a community mental health team, which offers day-to-day support and treatment. Many people recover from schizophrenia, although they may have periods when symptoms return (relapses). Support and treatment can help reduce the impact the condition has on daily life. Read about treating schizophrenia. Living with schizophrenia If schizophrenia is well managed, it''s possible to reduce the chance of severe relapses. This can include: recognising the signs of an acute episode taking medication as prescribed talking to others about the condition There are many charities and support groups offering help and advice on living with schizophrenia. Most people find it comforting talking to others with a similar condition. Read about living with schizophrenia. Page last reviewed: 11/10/2016 Next review due: 11/10/2019', 968390701),

(456, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Vegetative-state/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'state of impaired consciousness', 'Disorders of consciousness - NHS Choices', 'Disorders of consciousness  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  A disorder of consciousness, or impaired consciousness, is a state where consciousness has been affected by damage to the brain. Consciousness requires both wakefulness and awareness. Wakefulness is the ability to open your eyes and have basic reflexes such as coughing, swallowing and sucking. Awareness is associated with more complex thought processes and is more difficult to assess. Currently, the assessment of awareness relies on physical responses being detected during an examination. The main disorders of consciousness are: coma vegetative state minimally conscious state Coma A coma is when a person shows no signs of being awake and no signs of being aware. A person in a coma lies with their eyes closed and doesn''t respond to their environment, voices or pain. A coma usually lasts for less than two to four weeks, during which time a person may wake up or progress into a vegetative state or minimally conscious state. Read more about comas. Vegetative state A vegetative state is when a person is awake but is showing no signs of awareness. A person in a vegetative state may open their eyes, wake up and fall asleep at regular intervals and have basic reflexes, such as blinking when they''re startled by a loud noise, or withdrawing their hand when it''s squeezed hard. They''re also able to regulate their heartbeat and breathing without assistance. However, a person in a vegetative state doesn''t show any meaningful responses, such as following an object with their eyes or responding to voices. They also show no signs of experiencing emotions. If a person is in a vegetative state for a long time, it may be considered to be: a continuing vegetative state – when it''s been longer than four weeks a permanent vegetative state – when it''s been more than six months if caused by a non-traumatic brain injury, or more than 12 months if caused by a traumatic brain injury If a person is diagnosed as being in a permanent vegetative state, recovery is extremely unlikely but not impossible. Minimally conscious state A person who shows clear but minimal or inconsistent awareness is classified as being in a minimally conscious state. They may have periods where they can communicate or respond to commands, such as moving a finger when asked. A person may enter a minimally conscious state after being in a coma or vegetative state. In some cases a minimally conscious state is a stage on the route to recovery, but in others it''s permanent. As with vegetative state, a continuing minimally conscious state means it has lasted longer than four weeks. However, it''s more difficult to diagnose a permanent minimally conscious state because it depends on things such as: the type of brain injury how severe the injury is how responsive the person is In most cases, a minimally conscious state isn''t usually considered to be permanent until it''s lasted several years. Why they happen Disorders of consciousness can occur if the parts of the brain involved with consciousness are damaged. These types of brain injury can be divided into: traumatic brain injury – the result of a severe head injury, such as an injury sustained during a car accident or a fall from a great height non-traumatic brain injury – where the injury to the brain is caused by a health condition, such as a stroke progressive brain damage – where the brain is gradually damaged over time; for example, because of Alzheimer''s disease Read more about the causes of disorders of consciousness. Making a diagnosis A disorder of consciousness will only be confirmed after extensive testing to determine the person''s level of wakefulness and awareness. These examinations need to be carried out by someone experienced in disorders of consciousness, although the views of other healthcare professionals and family members should also be taken into consideration. For some states of impaired consciousness, such as vegetative state and minimally conscious state, there are recommended criteria to help confirm a diagnosis. Read more about diagnosing disorders of consciousness. Treatment and care Treatment can''t ensure recovery from a state of impaired consciousness. Instead, supportive treatment is used to give the best chance of natural improvement. This can involve: providing nutrition through a feeding tube  making sure the person is moved regularly so they don''t develop pressure ulcers gently exercising their joints to prevent them becoming tight keeping their skin clean managing their bowel and bladder – for example, using a tube known as a catheter to drain the bladder keeping their teeth and mouth clean offering opportunities for periods of meaningful activity – such as listening to music or watching television, being shown pictures or hearing family members talking Sensory stimulation In some cases, a treatment called sensory stimulation may be used in an attempt to increase responsiveness. This involves stimulating the main senses, such as vision, hearing and smell. It''s usually carried out by a trained specialist, but family members are often encouraged to be involved. Some examples of sensory stimulation include: visual – showing photos of friends and family, or a favourite film hearing – talking or playing a favourite song smell – putting flowers in the room or spraying a favourite perfume touch – holding their hand or stroking their skin with different fabrics It''s not entirely clear how effective sensory stimulation is, but it''s sometimes considered worthwhile.  Recovery It''s impossible to predict the chances of someone in a state of impaired consciousness improving. It largely depends on: the type of brain injury how severe the injury is the person''s age how long they''ve been in the state for Some people improve gradually, whereas others stay in a state of impaired consciousness for years. Many people never recover consciousness. There are only isolated cases of people recovering consciousness after several years. The few people who do regain consciousness after this time often have severe disabilities caused by the damage to their brain. Withdrawing nutritional support If a person has been in a vegetative state for a minimum of 12 months, it may be recommended that nutritional support is withdrawn. This is because: there''s almost no chance of a recovery by this point prolonging life would have no benefit for the person concerned prolonging treatment could offer false hope and cause unnecessary emotional distress for the friends and family of the person concerned The medical team will discuss the issue with family members, but the decision has to be referred to the courts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland before any further action can be taken. In Scotland a court ruling isn''t required, but is often sought. If the court agrees with the decision, a palliative care team will usually be involved in planning the withdrawal. Once nutritional support is eventually withdrawn, the person will die within a few days or weeks. Locked-in syndrome Locked-in syndrome has similar features to disorders of consciousness, but is considered and treated differently.  A person with locked-in syndrome is both conscious and aware, but completely paralysed and unable to speak. They''re usually able to move their eyes and are sometimes able to communicate by blinking.

For example, a blood test can be used to: assess your general state of health check if you have an infection see how well certain organs, such as the liver and kidneys, are working screen for certain genetic conditions Most blood tests only take a few minutes to complete and are carried out at your GP surgery or local hospital by a doctor, nurse or phlebotomist (a specialist in taking blood samples). Read about some common types of blood test. For more information about a wider range of tests, search the blood test A-Z index on Lab Tests Online UK. Preparing for a blood test The healthcare professional who arranges your blood test will tell you whether there are any specific instructions you need to follow before your test. For example, depending on the type of blood test, you may be asked to: avoid eating or drinking anything, apart from water (fasting) for up to 12 hours – see can I eat and drink before having a blood test? stop taking a certain medication – see can I take medication before having a blood test? It''s important to follow the instructions you''re given, as it may affect the result of the test and mean it needs to be delayed or carried out again. What happens during a blood test? A blood test usually involves taking a blood sample from a blood vessel in your arm. The arm is a convenient part of the body to use because it can be easily uncovered. The usual place for a sample to be taken from is the inside of the elbow or wrist, where the veins are relatively close to the surface. Blood samples from children are often taken from the back of the hand. Their skin may be numbed with a special spray or cream before the sample is taken. A tight band (tourniquet) is usually put around your upper arm. This squeezes the arm, temporarily slowing down the flow of blood and causing the vein to swell. This makes it easier for a sample to be taken. Before taking the sample, the doctor or nurse may clean the area of skin with an antiseptic wipe. A needle attached to a syringe or special container is inserted into the vein. The syringe is used to draw out a sample of your blood. You may feel a slight pricking or scratching sensation as the needle goes in, but it shouldn''t be painful. If you don''t like needles and blood, tell the person who is taking the sample so they can make you more comfortable. When the sample has been taken, the needle will be removed. Pressure is applied to the skin for a few minutes using a cotton-wool pad. A plaster may be put on the small wound to keep it clean. After the test Only a small amount of blood is taken during the test so you shouldn''t feel any significant after-effects. However, some people feel dizzy and faint during and after the test. If this has happened to you in the past, tell the person carrying out the test so they’re aware and can help you feel more comfortable. After the test, you may have a small bruise where the needle went in. Bruises can be painful, but are usually harmless and fade over the next few days. Blood test results After the blood sample has been taken, it will be put into a bottle and labelled with your name and details. It will then be sent to a laboratory where it will be examined under a microscope or tested with chemicals, depending on what''s being checked. The results are sent back to the hospital or to your GP. Some test results will be ready the same day or a few days later, although others may not be available for a few weeks. You''ll be told when your results will be ready and how you''ll be given them. Sometimes, receiving results can be stressful and upsetting. If you''re worried about the outcome of a test, you may choose to take a trusted friend or relative with you. For some tests, such as HIV, you will be offered specialist counselling to help you deal with your results. Page last reviewed: 27/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019', -516244538),

If other people are present, you could explain to them that the behaviour is because of an illness and is not directed at them personally. Keep a diary to see if you can find a pattern in their behaviour – for example, whether it is more likely to occur in certain situations, with the same people present, or at certain times of the day or night. If you''re finding it difficult to control the behaviour of the person you look after, speak to social services or their GP.

(459, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/dementia-guide/Pages/dementia-behaviour.aspx', 'dementia', 'Coping with the behavioural changes of dementia - Dementia guide - NHS Choices', '', 'Dementia can have a big impact on a person’s behaviour. It can make them feel anxious, lost, confused and frustrated. Although each person with dementia handles these feelings in their own way, certain behaviour is common in people with the disease. This includes: repeating questions or carrying out an activity over and over again walking and pacing up and down aggression, shouting and screaming becoming suspicious of other people If you are experiencing these kinds of behaviour, or are looking after someone who behaves in this way, it''s important to remember that this is an attempt to communicate how they''re feeling. They are not being deliberately difficult. If you stay calm and work out why they''re expressing themselves in this way, you may be able to calm them down. If you recognise early warning signs, you may be able to prevent behavioural outbursts. Some people find that a distraction can focus a person’s energies elsewhere and prevent them from displaying challenging behaviour. Your doctor may recommend behavioural therapies to help the person with dementia cope with their feelings. These therapies can be straightforward. For example, they may behave in a particular way because they''re bored and have built up too much energy, and a routine involving regular exercise could help solve both of these issues.  Find out how to live well with dementia and what you can do to stay active. Repetitive behaviour in dementia People with dementia often repeat questions or carry out certain actions over and over again. This may be due to: memory loss boredom anxiety side effects of medication If you think they''re bored, try engaging them in an activity they enjoy, such as listening to music. Most people with dementia feel anxious at some point and will need to be reassured of your love and support. If you''re concerned about the medicine the person you care for is taking, contact their GP for advice. Walking or pacing up and down is common behaviour in people with dementia. It''s very common for people at certain stages of dementia to pace up and down or leave their homes for long walks. This is a phase that doesn’t usually continue for long. The reasons why someone with dementia walks or paces may not be obvious, but they may leave the house intending to go to the shops, or visit a friend and then simply forget where they''re going. They may be bored or uncomfortable sitting at home and want to use up some energy. Or they may simply be confused about what they should be doing and where they should be. If you notice them leaving, you might want to accompany them to guide them and make sure they don''t end up being distressed. Don''t be afraid of talking to local shopkeepers and neighbours you trust to let them know about the person''s dementia. Give them a contact number to call if they''re concerned about the person’s behaviour. If you''re lucky, you may find that your area is part of a "dementia-friendly community". Tracking devices and alarm systems (telecare) won''t solve all your worries about someone with dementia, but may give you some piece of mind. People with dementia may be aggressive Aggressive behaviour is a known symptom of dementia. This can be particularly scary and upsetting when it is out of character. Seeing a loved one''s personality change is distressing, and may be a far more upsetting effect of dementia than memory loss. The most common form of aggression is shouting, screaming or using offensive language, including continually calling out for someone, shouting the same word or repetitive screaming. There are many causes of aggressive behaviour in dementia, including: fear or humiliation frustration with a situation depression no other way to express themselves loss of judgement loss of inhibitions and self-control It''s worth keeping a note of anything that has triggered someone''s aggressive behaviour. This may involve some trial and error, but if you can identify these triggers, you may be able to avoid them. During an episode of aggression, try not to make the situation worse by arguing or adopting an aggressive pose as this may make them lash out. It may help to count to 10 or remove yourself from the situation by leaving the room. One way to stay calm is to remember that even if the aggression seems personal or intentional, it is because of the illness. When the person has calmed down, try to act normally with them. They may forget the incident quickly, or may feel awkward. Acting normally can help you both move forward. Sometimes there are simple solutions to the aggression – for example, a night light can make some feel less anxious during the night, making them less likely to call out. People with dementia may become suspicious of others Dementia can make some people become very suspicious. This can be due to memory loss, lack of recognition of familiar faces and general confusion caused by the effects of the disease on the brain. The person you care for may accuse you or their friends and neighbours of taking their possessions. They may believe that everyone is out to get them. If they lose items, they may panic and convince themselves that they have been burgled. Their behaviour may seem delusional and paranoid, but as their carer, try to remember that the way they feel is very real. Listen to their worries, calm them down and, if you''re sure their suspicions are unfounded, try to change the subject.   Drug treatment for dementia-related behaviour In extreme circumstances – for example, if the person’s behaviour is harmful to themselves or others, and all methods of calming them have been tried – a doctor may prescribe medication. If you want information about drugs to help manage behavioural symptoms of dementia, or if you''re concerned about the side effects of medication, speak to the person’s GP. If you are looking after someone with dementia It may help to talk to someone about how you''re feeling. If you want to speak to other carers in similar situations, contact a local carers'' support group or a specialist dementia organisation. To find out what''s available in your area, contact Carers Direct on 0300 123 1053. Lines are open 9am-8pm Monday to Friday and 11am-4pm on weekends, and are closed bank holidays.

Carers'' support groups Media last reviewed: 24/05/2016 Next review due: 24/05/2019 If you have dementia, or you are looking after someone who has dementia, you are likely to face many practical issues in your daily life. People with dementia can feel vulnerable as their condition progresses and they increasingly rely on other people to do things for them. It is important that people who have dementia feel reassured and supported, while retaining some level of independence.  For more information, read staying independent with dementia. Although some symptoms are common to many people with dementia, each person''s experience of the disease and how they cope with it will be different. Helping someone with dementia with everyday tasks When a person with dementia finds that their mental abilities are declining, they''re likely to feel anxious, stressed and scared. They may be aware of their increasing clumsiness and inability to remember things, and this can be very frustrating and upsetting for them. If you are looking after someone with dementia, you can help them feel more secure by creating a regular daily routine in a relaxed environment, where they''re encouraged and not criticised. Involving the person you look after in everyday tasks may make them feel useful and improve their sense of self-worth. They could help with the shopping, laying the table or sweeping leaves in the garden, for example. As the illness progresses, these tasks may become harder for them to manage independently, and you may need to give them more support. How you can help The main way you can help someone with dementia is by offering support sensitively and try not to be critical of what they do. It can be very important for the person with dementia to feel that they''re still useful. In the early stages, memory aids can be used around the home to help the person remember where things are. For example, you could put pictures on cupboard doors of what''s inside, such as cups and saucers. This may help to trigger their memory and enable them to retain their independence a little longer. Keeping up hobbies and interests when someone has dementia Many people with dementia will still enjoy their hobbies or interests. For example, if they like cooking, they may be able to help make a meal. Going for a walk or gardening is a simple way to get some exercise and a sense of achievement. Or they may prefer listening to music or playing a board game. Caring for a pet cat or dog can bring a lot of pleasure to some people. If the person you care for was very sociable and outgoing, or if they have a large family, they may really enjoy visits from one or two family members or friends. However, they may struggle to keep up with conversations if they have a lot of visitors at the same time. You can find tips and ideas for people with dementia in this activities guide from Care UK (PDF, 1Mb). Maintaining good health and nutrition in someone with dementia It''s important that the person you care for has a healthy, balanced diet and gets some exercise. The longer they stay fit and healthy, the better their quality of life will be. If you want some easy exercises, try these sitting exercises.  If the person you care for doesn''t eat enough or eats unhealthy food, they can become susceptible to other illnesses. People with dementia can become more confused if they get ill. Common food-related problems for people with dementia include: not recognising foods forgetting what food they like refusing or spitting out food resisting being fed asking for strange food combinations This behaviour is usually due to confusion, or irritation in the mouth caused by dental problems, rather than wanting to be awkward. If you''re concerned about the person''s eating behaviour, speak to your GP. How you can help Involve the person you care for. For example, if they cannot feed themselves, you could put the cutlery in their hand and help guide it to their mouth. You could also involve them in preparing food, if they are able to. Try to stay calm. If you feel stressed at mealtimes, the person you care for will probably be stressed too. Make sure you have plenty of time for meals, so you can deal with any problems that arise. Try to accommodate behaviour changes. It''s likely that the person you care for will change their eating patterns and habits over time. Being aware of this and trying to be flexible will make mealtimes less stressful for both of you. If you think the person you care for may have health or dental problems, get help from your GP or dentist. You could also contact a local carers'' group to speak to other people who may have experienced similar difficulties. If the person with dementia smokes, replace matches with disposable lighters to lower the risk of them accidentally causing a fire. If the person you care for drinks alcohol, check if this is recommended alongside any medication they make take. If in doubt, ask your GP. Dealing with incontinence in someone with dementia Incontinence can be difficult to deal with and can be very upsetting for the person you care for. It''s common for people with dementia to experience incontinence. This can be due to urinary tract infections, constipation causing added pressure on the bladder, or medication. A person with dementia may also simply forget to go to the toilet, or may forget where the toilet is. They may also have lost the ability to tell when they need the toilet. How you can help It''s important to be understanding, retain a sense of humour and remember that it''s not their fault. You may also want to try the following: Put a sign on the toilet door, such as a photo of the toilet. Keep the toilet door open and make sure that the person you care for can access it easily. Make sure they can remove their clothes – some people with dementia can struggle with buttons and zips. Look out for signs that they may need to go to the toilet, such as fidgeting and standing up and down. Get adaptations to the toilet if necessary – you may be able to get these through a care and support needs assessment. If you''re still having problems with incontinence, ask your GP to refer you to a continence advisor, who can advise on things like waterproof bedding or incontinence pads. Helping someone with dementia with their personal hygiene People with dementia can become anxious about certain aspects of personal hygiene and may need help with washing. For example, they may be scared of falling when getting out of the bath, or they may become disorientated in the shower. The person you care for may not want to be left alone or they may resist washing, because they find the lack of privacy undignified and embarrassing. Try to do what''s best for them. Read more about personal hygiene for people who are cared for. Helping someone with dementia sleep well People with dementia often experience disturbed sleep. They may wake up during the night or be restless. These problems may get worse as the illness progresses. People with dementia may also have painful illnesses such as arthritis that cause, or contribute to, sleep problems. Some medication can cause sleepiness during the day and interfere with sleep at night. Sleeping pills can be used with care in people with dementia. However, "sleep hygiene" measures are best for people with dementia – for example, no naps during the day, regular bedtimes, and avoiding alcohol or caffeine at night. Read more about sleeping well. Taking care of your own wellbeing If you or a family member has dementia, you may find it difficult to stay positive. Remember that you are not alone, and that help and support is available. Talk to someone about your worries. This could be a family member or friend, a member of your local dementia support group, or your GP can refer you to a counsellor in your area. It is important for a carer''s physical health and psychological wellbeing that they are able to take a break (respite) from care. Carers may also need respite care if they have to go into hospital or meet other important commitments. Friends, relatives and neighbours can provide respite care at home. You can also arrange home respite care through home care agencies or, in some areas, your local authority. Care away from home can confuse some people with dementia, both while they are away and when they come back. If you decide on respite care away from the person''s home, it is a good idea to visit beforehand to check that it meets the needs of the person with dementia. Caring for someone with dementia can be frustrating and stressful at times, but there are many organisations that can help. For more details, call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053. Lines are open 9am-8pm Monday to Friday and 11am-4pm on weekends. Reading Well Books on Prescription for dementia offers support for people diagnosed with dementia and their relatives and carers. GPs and other health professionals can recommend titles from a list of 25 books on dementia. The books are available for anyone to borrow for free from their local library.

Usually, you can''t get more than one of these benefits at the same time. This means that even if you''re entitled to more than one earnings-replacement benefit, you''ll usually receive whichever is the highest. This is called the overlapping benefits rule. Earnings-replacement benefits The following earnings-replacement benefits are based on National Insurance (NI) contributions.  Bereavement Allowance (formerly Widow''s Pension) Contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance Contribution-based Jobseeker''s Allowance Maternity Allowance State Pension Widowed Parent''s Allowance Carer''s Allowance is not based on NI contributions. You usually can''t receive more than one of the above benefits at the same time. If you or the person you care for are entitled to more than one of these benefits, a benefit based on NI contributions will be paid in preference to Carer''s Allowance or any other earnings-replacement benefit that does not depend on NI contributions. If you''re entitled to two benefits, you''ll get the benefit that pays the higher amount. If you''re entitled to a benefit based on NI contributions, but this is worth less than another benefit not based on NI contributions, you''ll be paid the benefit based on NI contributions plus the difference between the two benefits. Increases for adult dependants Some earnings-replacement benefits may give you an increased amount if you have an adult dependant. You''ll only receive one increase for an adult dependant, even if you get more than one earnings-replacement benefit. You''ll receive the highest increase that can be paid. Overlapping benefits If you cannot be paid any Carer''s Allowance because you''re being paid another earnings-replacement benefit, you still have an underlying entitlement to Carer''s Allowance. Although you won''t be paid Carer''s Allowance, it''s worth making a claim for it. This is because the underlying entitlement to Carer''s Allowance means an amount called a carer premium, or carer addition for Pension Credit, can be included in the calculation of any means-tested benefits you''re entitled to. The carer premium or addition can make it more likely you''ll receive a means-tested benefit, or more of a means-tested benefit is paid to you. For example, Carol is 64 and looks after her husband. She gets a State Pension and Pension Credit. She makes a claim for Carer''s Allowance, but is told she cannot be paid it because it overlaps with the State Pension she receives. The letter she receives from the Carer''s Allowance Unit will tell her that although Carer''s Allowance cannot be paid, she has an underlying entitlement to it. Carol can then send a copy of this letter to the Pension Service (who pay her Pension Credit), and they will increase the amount of Pension Credit she receives. This is because a carer''s addition will be added to her Pension Credit. A carer addition can be paid as part of Pension Credit. A carer premium can be paid as part of the following means-tested benefits: Income Support Income-related Employment and Support Allowance Jobseeker''s Allowance Housing Benefit Find out more about benefits for carers.
