Symptoms of ADHD tend to be noticed at an early age and may become more noticeable when a child''s circumstances change, such as when they start school. Most cases are diagnosed when children are 6 to 12 years old. The symptoms of ADHD usually improve with age, but many adults who are diagnosed with the condition at a young age continue to experience problems. People with ADHD may also have additional problems, such as sleep and anxiety disorders. Read more about the symptoms of ADHD. Getting help  Many children go through phases where they''re restless or inattentive. This is often completely normal and doesn''t necessarily mean they have ADHD. However, you should consider raising your concerns with your child''s teacher, their school''s special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) or GP if you think their behaviour may be different to most children their age. It''s also a good idea to speak to your GP if you''re an adult and you think you may have ADHD, but you weren''t diagnosed with the condition as a child. Read more about diagnosing ADHD. What causes ADHD? The exact cause of ADHD is unknown, but the condition has been shown to run in families. Research has also identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared to those who don''t have the condition. Other factors that have been suggested as potentially having a role in ADHD include: being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) having a low birthweight smoking, alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy It''s thought that around 2% to 5% of school-aged children may have ADHD. ADHD can occur in people of any intellectual ability, although it''s more common in people with learning difficulties. Read more about the causes of ADHD. How ADHD is treated Although there''s no cure for ADHD, it can be managed with appropriate educational support, advice and support for parents and affected children, alongside medication, if necessary. Medication is often the first treatment offered to adults with ADHD, although psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may also help. Read more about treating ADHD. Living with ADHD Looking after a child with ADHD can be challenging, but it''s important to remember that they can''t help their behaviour. Some issues that may arise in day-to-day life include: getting your child to sleep at night getting ready for school on time listening to and carrying out instructions being organised social occasions shopping Adults with ADHD may also find they have similar problems, and some may have issues with drugs, crime and employment. Read about living with ADHD for information on ways to cope with these issues. Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 25/04/2016 Next review due: 01/04/2019', 560882612),

It''s not usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment or within a few weeks without treatment. Impetigo is the most common skin infection in young children in the UK, but it can affect people of all ages. This topic covers: Symptoms When to seek medical advice Causes Treatment Preventing the spread of impetigo Preventing recurrent impetigo Complications Symptoms of impetigo  There are two types of impetigo: non-bullous impetigo – the most common type bullous impetigo The symptoms of both types are described below. Non-bullous impetigo The symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores – usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected. The sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin. After the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually fades without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks. The sores aren''t painful, but they may be itchy. It''s important not to touch or scratch the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of the body, and to other people. Other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and swollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases. Bullous impetigo The symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the central part of the body between the waist and neck, or on the arms and legs. The blisters are usually about 1-2cm across. The blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring. The blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. As with non-bullous impetigo, it''s important not to touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin. Symptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo. When to seek medical advice Speak to your GP if you think you or your child may have symptoms of impetigo. Impetigo isn''t usually serious, but it can sometimes have similar symptoms to more serious conditions such as cellulitis (an infection of the deeper layers of skin) so it''s important to get a correct diagnosis. Your GP can also prescribe treatment to help clear up the infection more quickly than if it was left untreated. Causes of impetigo Impetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The bacteria can infect the skin in two main ways: through a break in otherwise healthy skin – such as a cut, insect bite or other injury – this is known as primary impetigo through skin damaged by another underlying skin condition, such as head lice, scabies or eczema – this is known as secondary impetigo The bacteria can be spread easily through close contact with someone who has the infection, such as through direct physical contact, or by sharing towels or flannels. As the condition doesn''t cause any symptoms until four to 10 days after initial exposure to the bacteria, it''s often easily spread to others unintentionally. Children and people with diabetes or a weakened immune system – either due to a condition such as HIV or a treatment such as chemotherapy – are most at risk of developing impetigo. Treating impetigo Impetigo usually gets better without treatment in around two to three weeks. However, treatment is often recommended because it can reduce the length of the illness to around seven to 10 days and can lower the risk of the infection being spread to others. The main treatments prescribed are antibiotic creams or antibiotic tablets. These usually have to be used for around a week. Read about treating impetigo. Preventing the spread of impetigo During treatment, it''s important to take precautions to minimise the risk of impetigo spreading to other people or to other areas of the body. Most people are no longer contagious after 48 hours of treatment or once their sores have dried and healed. It''s important to stay away from work, school, nursery or playgroup until this point. The advice below can also help to prevent the spread of the infection: don''t share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo – wash them at a high temperature after use wash the sores with soap and water and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing avoid touching or scratching the sores, or letting others touch them – it may help to ensure your nails are kept clean and short avoid contact with newborn babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym – until the risk of infection has passed wash your hands frequently – particularly after touching infected skin washable toys should also be washed – wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completely If you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they''re seen by a GP as soon as possible. Preventing recurrent impetigo To reduce the risk of impetigo returning, make sure any cuts, scratches or bites are kept clean. Ensure any condition that causes broken skin, such as eczema, is treated promptly. If you develop impetigo frequently, your doctor may suggest taking a swab from around your nose to see if you carry staphylococcal bacteria. These bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, although they can lead to impetigo if they infect broken skin nearby. If you''re found to carry these bacteria, you may be prescribed an antiseptic nasal cream to apply several times a day for five to 10 days in an attempt to clear the bacteria and reduce the chances of impetigo recurring. Complications of impetigo Complications of impetigo are rare, but they can sometimes occur and can be serious. Tell your GP if you have impetigo and your symptoms change or get worse. Some complications associated with impetigo include: cellulitis – an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue scarlet fever – a rare bacterial infection that causes a fine, pink rash across the body guttate psoriasis – a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection septicaemia (a type of sepsis) – a bacterial infection of the blood Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) – a serious skin condition that looks like the skin has been scalded with boiling water post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis – an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneys In very rare cases, impetigo may lead to some scarring, particularly if you scratch at the blisters, crusts or sores.

This must be done on the basis of an explanation by a clinician. Consent from a patient is needed regardless of the procedure – whether it''s a physical examination, organ donation or something else. The principle of consent is an important part of medical ethics and the international human rights law. This topic covers: Defining consent How consent is given Consent from children and young people When consent isn''t needed Consent and life-sustaining treatment Complaints Defining consent For consent to be valid, it must be voluntary and informed, and the person consenting must have the capacity to make the decision. These terms are explained below: Voluntary – the decision to either consent or not to consent to treatment must be made by the person themselves, and must not be influenced by pressure from medical staff, friends or family. Informed – the person must be given all of the information in terms of what the treatment involves, including the benefits and risks, whether there are reasonable alternative treatments and what will happen if treatment doesn''t go ahead. Capacity – the person must be capable of giving consent, which means they understand the information given to them, and they can use it to make an informed decision. If an adult has the capacity to make a voluntary and informed decision to consent to or refuse a particular treatment, their decision must be respected. This is still the case even if refusing treatment would result in their death, or the death of their unborn child. If a person doesn''t have the capacity to make a decision about their treatment, the healthcare professionals treating them can go ahead and give treatment if they believe it''s in the person’s best interests. However, the clinicians must take reasonable steps to seek advice from the patient’s friends or relatives before making these decisions. Read more about assessing the capacity to consent. How consent is given Consent can be given: verbally – for example, by saying they''re happy to have an X-ray in writing – for example, by signing a consent form for surgery Someone could also give non-verbal consent, as long as they understand the treatment or examination about to take place – for example, holding out an arm for a blood test. Consent should be given to the healthcare professional directly responsible for the person''s current treatment, such as: a nurse arranging a blood test a GP prescribing new medication a surgeon planning an operation If someone is going to have a major medical procedure, such as an operation, their consent should ideally be secured well in advance, so they have plenty of time to obtain information about the procedure and ask questions. If they change their mind at any point before the procedure, the person is entitled to withdraw their previous consent. Consent from children and young people If they''re able to, consent is usually given by patients themselves. However, someone with parental responsibility may need to give consent for a child up to the age of 16 to have treatment. Read more about the rules of consent applying to children and young people When consent isn''t needed There are a few exceptions when treatment may be able to go ahead without the person''s consent, even if they''re capable of giving their permission. It may not be necessary to obtain consent if a person: requires emergency treatment to save their life, but they''re incapacitated (for example, they''re unconscious) – the reasons why treatment was necessary should be fully explained once they''ve recovered immediately requires an additional emergency procedure during an operation – there has to be a clear medical reason why it would be unsafe to wait to obtain consent, and it can''t be simply for convenience with a severe mental health condition – such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or dementia – lacks the capacity to consent to the treatment of their mental health (under the Mental Health Act 1983) – in these cases, treatment for unrelated physical conditions still requires consent, which the patient may be able to provide, despite their mental illness requires hospital treatment for a severe mental health condition, but self-harmed or attempted suicide while competent and is refusing treatment (under the Mental Health Act 1983) – the person''s nearest relative or an approved social worker must make an application for the person to be forcibly kept in hospital, and two doctors must assess the person''s condition is a risk to public health (due to rabies, cholera or tuberculosis (TB) is severely ill and living in unhygienic conditions (under the National Assistance Act 1948) – a person who is severely ill or infirm and is living in unsanitary conditions can be taken to a place of care without their consent Consent and life-sustaining treatments A person may be being kept alive with supportive treatments – such as lung ventilation – without having made an advance decision, which outlines the care they would refuse to receive. In these cases, a decision about continuing or stopping treatment needs to be made based on what that person''s best interests are believed to be. To help reach a decision, the healthcare professionals responsible for the person’s care should discuss the issue with the relatives and friends of the person receiving the treatment. They should consider, among other things: what the person''s quality of life will be if treatment is continued how long the person may live if treatment is continued whether there''s any chance of the person recovering Treatment can be withdrawn if there''s an agreement that continuing treatment isn''t in the person''s best interests. The case will be referred to the courts before further action is taken if: an agreement can''t be reached a decision has to be made on whether to withdraw treatment from someone who has been in a state of impaired consciousness for a long time (usually at least 12 months) It''s important to note the difference between withdrawing a person''s life support and taking a deliberate action to make them die. For example, injecting a lethal drug would illegal.

Anyone can get measles if they haven''t been vaccinated or they haven''t had it before, although it''s most common in young children. The infection usually clears in around 7 to 10 days. Symptoms of measles The initial symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you''re infected. These can include: cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40C (104F) small greyish-white spots on the inside of the cheeks A few days later, a red-brown blotchy rash will appear. This usually starts on the head or upper neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body. Read more about the symptoms of measles. When to see your GP You should contact your GP as soon as possible if you suspect that you or your child may have measles. It''s best to phone before your visit as your GP surgery may need to make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others. You should also see your GP if you''ve been in close contact with someone who has measles and you''ve not been fully vaccinated (had two doses of the MMR vaccine) or haven''t had the infection before – even if you don''t have any symptoms. Is measles serious? Measles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems. Once you''ve had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus and it''s highly unlikely you''ll get it again. However, measles can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (encephalitis). Read more about the complications of measles. How measles is spread The measles virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can easily catch measles by breathing in these droplets or, if the droplets have settled on a surface, by touching the surface and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth. The virus can survive on surfaces for a few hours. People with measles are infectious from when the symptoms develop until about four days after the rash first appears. How measles can be prevented Measles can be prevented by having the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. This is given in two doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. The first dose is given when your child is around 13 months old and a second dose is given before your child starts school. Adults and older children can be vaccinated at any age if they haven''t been fully vaccinated before. Ask your GP about having the vaccination. If the MMR vaccine isn''t suitable for you, a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) can be used if you''re at immediate risk of catching measles. Read more about preventing measles. Treating measles There are several things you can do to help relieve your symptoms and reduce the risk of spreading the infection, including: taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve fever, aches and pains – aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old drinking plenty of water to avoid dehydration closing the curtains to help reduce light sensitivity using damp cotton wool to clean the eyes staying off school or work for at least four days from when the rash first appears In severe cases, especially if there are complications, you or your child may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. Read more about treating measles. How common is measles? The effectiveness of the MMR vaccine means that cases of measles are uncommon in the UK nowadays. However, the number of cases has risen in recent years and there have been some high-profile outbreaks. For example, between November 2012 and July 2013 there was an outbreak in and around Swansea, during which more than 1,200 cases were reported. It''s thought the rise in the number of cases of measles is the result of parents not getting their child vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, probably because of speculation linking MMR to autism. Publicity in 1998 highlighted a report claiming there was a link between the MMR jab and autism. However, numerous studies undertaken to investigate this claim found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Page last reviewed: 11/09/2015 Next review due: 01/09/2018', 1401306472),

It’s most recognisable by the painful swellings at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), giving a person with mumps a distinctive "hamster face" appearance. Other symptoms of mumps include headaches, joint pain and a high temperature, which may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands. When to see your GP It''s important to contact your GP if you suspect mumps so a diagnosis can be made. While mumps isn''t usually serious, the condition has similar symptoms to more serious types of infection, such as glandular fever and tonsillitis. Your GP can usually make a diagnosis after seeing and feeling the swelling, looking at the position of the tonsils in the mouth and checking the person''s temperature to see if it''s higher than normal. Let your GP know in advance if you''re coming to the surgery, so they can take any necessary precautions to prevent the spread of infection. If your GP suspects mumps, they should notify your local health protection unit (HPU). The HPU will arrange for a sample of saliva to be tested to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. How mumps is spread Mumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu – through infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and transferred into the mouth or nose.   A person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards. During this time, it''s important to prevent the infection spreading to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who haven''t been vaccinated. If you have mumps, you can help prevent it spreading by: regularly washing your hands with soap using and disposing of tissues when you sneeze avoiding school or work for at least five days after your symptoms first develop Preventing mumps You can protect your child against mumps by making sure they''re given the combined MMR vaccine (for mumps, measles and rubella). The MMR vaccine is part of the routine NHS childhood immunisation schedule. Your child should be given one dose when they are around 12-13 months and a second booster dose before they start school. Once both doses are given, the vaccine provides 95% protection against mumps. Treatment for mumps There''s currently no cure for mumps, but the infection should pass within one or two weeks. Treatment is used to relieve symptoms and includes: getting plenty of bed rest and fluids using painkillers, such as ibuprofen and paracetamol – aspirin shouldn''t be given to children under 16 applying a warm or cool compress to the swollen glands to help relieve pain Read more about treating mumps. Complications Mumps usually passes without causing serious damage to a person''s health. Serious complications are rare. However, mumps can lead to viral meningitis if the virus moves into the outer layer of the brain. Other complications include swelling of the testicles in males or the ovaries in females (if the affected male or female has gone through puberty). Read more about the complications of mumps. Who is affected Most cases of mumps occur in young adults (usually born between 1980 and 1990) who didn’t receive the MMR vaccine as part of their childhood vaccination schedule or didn''t have mumps as a child. There were 2,224 confirmed cases of mumps in England and Wales during 2014.

It affects most people from time to time and is usually nothing to worry about. However, it can be distressing and unpleasant until it passes, which normally takes a few days to a week. What causes diarrhoea? There are many different causes of diarrhoea, but a bowel infection (gastroenteritis) is a common cause in both adults and children. Gastroenteritis can be caused by: a virus – such as norovirus or rotavirus bacteria – such as campylobacter and Escherichia coli (E. coli), which are often picked up from contaminated food  a parasite – such as the parasite that causes giardiasis, which is spread in contaminated water These infections can sometimes be caught during travel abroad, particularly to areas with poor standards of public hygiene. This is known as travellers'' diarrhoea. Diarrhoea can also be the result of anxiety, a food allergy, medication, or a long-term condition, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Read more about the causes of diarrhoea. What to do if you have diarrhoea Most cases of diarrhoea clear up after a few days without treatment, and you may not need to see your GP. However, diarrhoea can lead to dehydration, so you should drink plenty of fluids – small, frequent sips of water – until it passes. It''s very important that babies and small children do not become dehydrated. Your pharmacist may suggest you use an oral rehydration solution (ORS) if you or your child are particularly at risk of dehydration. You should eat solid food as soon as you feel able to. If you''re breastfeeding or bottle feeding your baby and they have diarrhoea, you should try to feed them as normal. Stay at home until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea to prevent spreading any infection to others. Medications to reduce diarrhoea, such as loperamide, are available. However, these are not usually necessary, and most types should not be given to children. Read more about treating diarrhoea. When to see your GP Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if you''re concerned about yourself or your child. It''s important to see your GP if the diarrhoea is particularly frequent or severe, or associated with other symptoms, such as: blood in your or your child''s poo persistent vomiting a severe or continuous stomach ache weight loss signs of dehydration – including drowsiness, passing urine infrequently, and feeling lightheaded or dizzy your poo is dark or black – this may be a sign of bleeding inside your stomach You should also contact your GP if your or your child''s diarrhoea is particularly persistent, as this may be a sign of a more serious problem. In most cases, diarrhoea should pass within about a week. Read more about when to contact your GP and diagnosing diarrhoea. Preventing diarrhoea Diarrhoea is often caused by an infection. You can reduce your risk by making sure you maintain high standards of hygiene. For example, you should: wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after going to the toilet and before eating or preparing food clean the toilet, including the handle and the seat, with disinfectant after each bout of diarrhoea avoid sharing towels, flannels, cutlery, or utensils with other household members It''s also important to practise good food and water hygiene while travelling abroad, such as avoiding potentially unsafe tap water and undercooked food.

It is also known as infectious mononucleosis, or "mono". Common symptoms include: a high temperature (fever) a severely sore throat swollen glands in the neck fatigue (extreme tiredness) While the symptoms of glandular fever can be very unpleasant, most of them should pass within two to three weeks. Fatigue, however, can occasionally last several months. Read more about the symptoms of glandular fever. When to seek medical advice You should contact your GP if you suspect that you or your child has glandular fever. While there is little your GP can do in terms of treatment, they can provide advice and support to help you control your symptoms and reduce the risk of passing the infection on to others. You should go to your local accident and emergency (A&E) department or dial 999 for an ambulance if you have glandular fever and you: develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties find swallowing fluids difficult develop intense abdominal pain These symptoms can be a sign of a complication of glandular fever that may need to be treated in hospital. What causes glandular fever? Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is found in the saliva of infected people and can be spread through: kissing – glandular fever is often referred to as the "kissing disease" exposure to coughs and sneezes sharing eating and drinking utensils, such as cups, glasses and unwashed cutlery EBV may be found in the saliva of someone who has had glandular fever for several months after their symptoms pass, and some people may continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years. If you have EBV, it''s a good idea to take steps to avoid infecting others while you are ill, such as not kissing other people, but there''s no need no need to avoid all contact with others as the chances of passing on the infection are generally low. Read more about the causes of glandular fever. Who is affected? Glandular fever can affect people of all ages, but most cases affect teenagers and young adults. Most EBV infections are thought to occur during childhood and cause only mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all. However, if a person develops an EBV infection during early adulthood, they can develop glandular fever. Once you have had glandular fever, it is unlikely you will develop it again. This is because people develop lifelong immunity after the initial infection. How glandular fever is diagnosed To diagnose glandular fever, your GP will first ask about your symptoms before carrying out a physical examination. They will look for characteristic signs of glandular fever, such as swollen glands, tonsils, liver and spleen. Your GP may also recommend a blood test to help confirm the diagnosis and rule out infections that can cause similar symptoms, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella, mumps and toxoplasmosis. How glandular fever is treated There is no cure for glandular fever, but there are a number of simple treatments and measures that can help reduce the symptoms while you wait for your body to control the infection. These include: drinking plenty of fluids taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen getting plenty of rest and gradually increasing your activity as your energy levels improve Occasionally, antibiotics or corticosteroids may be used if you develop complications of glandular fever. Some people with particularly severe symptoms may need to be looked after in hospital for a few days. Read more about treating glandular fever. Possible complications Complications associated with glandular fever are uncommon, but when they do occur they can be serious. They can include: further infections of other areas of the body, including the brain, liver and lungs severe anaemia (a lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells) breathing difficulties as a result of the tonsils becoming significantly swollen a ruptured (burst) spleen, which may need to be treated with surgery Read more about the complications of glandular fever.

It''s a common harmless condition that doesn''t usually itch or cause discomfort to the baby. If your baby is scratching their head or there is swelling, speak to your GP as it may be a sign of another condition, such as atopic eczema. The medical name for cradle cap is seborrhoeic dermatitis. It usually occurs on the scalp, but can also appear on the face, ears, neck, nappy area or in skin folds, such as at the back of the knees and armpits. Cradle cap usually appears in babies in the first two months and tends to clear up by itself after a few weeks or months. In most cases, it will clear by the time your baby is one year old. What does cradle cap look like? Cradle cap is easy to recognise by the large, greasy, yellow or brown scales on your baby''s scalp. The scales will start to flake and may make the affected skin look red. Sometimes the hair will come away with the flakes, but it will grow back. What causes cradle cap? It''s not clear what causes cradle cap, although it may be linked to overactive sebaceous glands. These are glands in the skin that produce an oily substance called sebum. Some babies are thought to retain some of their mother''s hormones in their bodies for several weeks or months after their birth. These hormones may make the baby''s glands produce more sebum. Cradle cap isn''t contagious and it isn''t caused by poor hygiene or an allergy. It doesn''t mean the baby isn''t being looked after properly or has an infection. Babies with cradle cap may be more likely to develop dandruff, which is another type of seborrhoeic dermatitis, when they''re older. Does cradle cap need treatment? Most cases of cradle cap will clear up on their own in time. Gently washing your baby''s hair and scalp with baby shampoo can help prevent a build-up of scales. Massaging baby oil or natural oil, such as olive oil, into their scalp at night can help loosen the crust. There is usually no need to see your GP if your baby has cradle cap. However, you may want to ask them for advice if your baby''s scalp becomes inflamed or if the cradle cap spreads to other parts of their body.  It''s important not to pick at the scales as this can cause an infection. Special shampoos You can buy special shampoo for cradle cap from your local pharmacy. Always read the instruction leaflet to check it''s safe to use on your child. Avoid getting the shampoo in your baby''s eyes. If you''re unsure about using it, speak to a pharmacist for advice. Generally, don''t use shampoos that contain groundnut oil or peanut oil on children under five years of age. See your GP if your baby''s cradle cap is severe, if there is swelling or bleeding, or if there are signs of cradle cap on their face or body. Treating an infection If your baby''s cradle cap becomes inflamed or infected, a course of antibiotics or an antifungal cream or shampoo such as ketoconazole may be prescribed by a doctor. A mild steroid cream such as hydrocortisone may also be recommended for an inflamed rash.

It can mean that you''re not passing stools regularly or you''re unable to completely empty your bowel. Constipation can also cause your stools to be hard and lumpy, as well as unusually large or small. The severity of constipation varies from person to person. Many people only experience constipation for a short time, but for others, constipation can be a long-term (chronic) condition that causes significant pain and discomfort and affects quality of life. Read more about the symptoms of constipation. What causes constipation? It''s often difficult to identify the exact cause of constipation. However, there are a number of things that contribute to the condition, including: not eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals a change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits ignoring the urge to pass stools side effects of certain medications not drinking enough fluids anxiety or depression In children, poor diet, fear about using the toilet and problems toilet training can all lead to constipation. Read more about the causes of constipation. Who''s affected Constipation can occur in babies, children and adults. It''s estimated that around one in every seven adults and up to one in every three children in the UK has constipation at any one time. The condition affects twice as many women as men and is also more common in older adults and during pregnancy. When to see your GP You may be able to treat constipation yourself by making simple changes to your diet and lifestyle (see below). If these changes don''t help and the problem continues, you should see your GP. Also speak to your GP if you think your child might be constipated. Read more about diagnosing constipation. Treating constipation Diet and lifestyle changes are usually recommended as the first treatment for constipation. This includes gradually increasing your daily intake of fibre, making sure you drink plenty of fluids, and trying to get more exercise. If these aren''t effective, your GP may prescribe an oral laxative medication that can help you empty your bowels. Treatment for constipation is effective, although in some cases it can take several months before a regular bowel pattern is re-established. Read more about treating constipation. Preventing constipation Making the diet and lifestyle changes mentioned above can also help to reduce your risk of developing constipation in the first place. Giving yourself enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably may also help, and you should try not to ignore the urge to go to the toilet. Read more about preventing constipation. Complications For most people constipation rarely causes complications, but people with long-term constipation can develop: haemorrhoids (piles) faecal impaction (where dry, hard stools collect in the rectum) bowel incontinence (the leakage of liquid stools) Read more about the complications of constipation.

You may feel hazy or groggy as you come round from the anaesthetic. A nurse will give you oxygen (through tubes or a mask) to help you feel better. It''s common to feel sick or vomit after you''ve been given anaesthesia. Your nurse may offer you medicine to help relieve this discomfort. You may also have a sore throat and dry mouth. Your blood pressure will be taken via an automatic cuff that squeezes tightly at regular times. Your temperature will also be taken. The outcome of your operation It''s important to find out how well your operation went. Here are some questions you may want to ask: Was the operation as successful as expected? What effect has the operation had on my condition? How will I expect to feel when I get home? How long will it be before I''m back to normal? Managing pain Tell your nurse as soon as you start to feel any pain, so they can give you painkilling medication as soon as possible, to stop it getting worse (the medication can take 20 minutes to start working). Avoiding blood clots The sooner you start to move around, the better. Lying in bed for too long can cause some of your blood to pool in your legs. This puts you at risk of a blood clot. If possible, doing some leg exercises can help to prevent a blood clot. These may be as simple as flexing your knee or ankle and rotating your foot. You may be given special support stockings to wear after surgery to help your blood circulation. Your nurse or doctor will explain how you should use these. Some people are given an injection to thin the blood slightly to help reduce the risk of clots. Enhanced recovery Research shows the earlier you get out of bed and start walking, eating and drinking after your operation, the better. Your hospital may offer an enhanced recovery programme if you''ve had major surgery. This rehabilitation programme aims to get you back to full health quickly, which means you could go home sooner than traditionally expected. Plan for your days following surgery It''s important to arrange for appropriate care following your operation. For elderly people, it''s important to arrange for suitable equipment and care. You shouldn''t be afraid to ask for things that may help you, such as a wheelchair or walking frame. Discharge Before you leave hospital you may (depending on the type of operation you had) have an appointment with a physiotherapist, who will be able to advise you about any exercises you need to carry out. You''ll also be given advice about how to care for your wound, a dose of painkillers, and any equipment you may require, such as dressings, bandages, crutches and splints. Each hospital will have its own policy and arrangements for discharging patients. Your discharge will be affected by: how quickly your health improves while you''re in hospital what support you''ll need after you return home You may want to ask some questions before you leave hospital, such as: Who should I call if I have any concerns once I''m home? What should I be trying to do on my own – for example, going to the bathroom and getting out of bed? Is there anything I should avoid doing? When can I go back to work? How much pain, bruising or swelling should I expect when I get home? When and where will any stitches be removed? Do I need to return to hospital or my GP for follow-up? If so, when will this be? Read more about leaving hospital. Transport home You won’t be able to drive yourself home after surgery. Instead, you could ask someone to pick you up or take you home in a taxi. It''s a good idea to have an adult available to help you for at least 24 hours after surgery. What happens next?

It may be triggered by bad posture while sitting or standing, bending awkwardly, or lifting incorrectly. It''s not generally caused by a serious condition. Find out more about the causes of back pain. In most cases back pain will improve in a few weeks or months, although some people experience long-term pain or pain that keeps coming back. Types of back pain Backache is most common in the lower back (lumbago), although it can be felt anywhere along your spine, from your neck down to your hips. Read information on neck pain and shoulder pain, which are covered separately. Sometimes back pain can be caused by an injury or disease, such as: a slipped disc – when one of the discs in the spine is damaged and presses on the nerves sciatica – irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve, which causes pain, numbness and tingling that travels down one leg whiplash – neck injury caused by a sudden impact frozen shoulder – inflammation around the shoulder that causes pain and stiffness ankylosing spondylitis – a long-term condition that causes pain and stiffness where the spine meets the pelvis The rest of this information will focus on back pain that doesn''t have an obvious cause. Doctors call this non-specific back pain. What to do Most cases of back pain get better on their own and you may not need to see a doctor. If you''ve only had back pain for a few days or weeks, the following advice may help relieve your symptoms and speed up your recovery: remain as active as possible and try to continue with your daily activities take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen if you feel you need to use hot or cold compression packs – you can buy these from your local pharmacy, or a bag of frozen vegetables and a hot water bottle will work just as well Although it can be difficult to be cheerful or optimistic if you are in pain, it''s important to stay positive as this can help you recover faster. Read more about treatments for short-term back pain. Treatments for long-term back pain If you''re worried about your back or your pain hasn''t improved by around six weeks, it''s a good idea to visit your GP, who can advise you about the treatments available. These include: stronger painkillers exercise classes – where you are taught specific exercises to strengthen your muscles and improve your posture manual therapy – such as physiotherapy, chiropractic or osteopathy acupuncture counselling – such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) support and advice at a specialist pain clinic Some people choose to see a therapist for manual therapy or acupuncture without seeing their GP first. If you want to do this, you will usually need to pay for private treatment, which is likely to cost around £30-50 for each appointment. Spinal surgery is usually only recommended when all else has failed. Read more about treating long-term back pain. Preventing back pain How you sit, stand, lie and lift can all affect the health of your back. Try to avoid placing too much pressure on your back and ensure it''s strong and supple. Regular exercise, such as walking and swimming, is an excellent way of preventing back pain. Activities such as yoga or pilates can improve your flexibility and strengthen your back muscles.

The hormone insulin – produced by the pancreas – is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 – where the pancreas doesn''t produce any insulin type 2 – where the pancreas doesn''t produce enough insulin or the body''s cells don''t react to insulin These pages are about type 2 diabetes. Read more about type 1 diabetes. Another type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear after birth. Symptoms of diabetes The symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means glucose stays in the blood and isn''t used as fuel for energy. Your body tries to reduce blood glucose levels by getting rid of the excess glucose in your urine. Typical symptoms include: feeling very thirsty passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired weight loss and loss of muscle bulk Read more about the symptoms of type 2 diabetes. It''s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible as it will get progressively worse if left untreated. Read about how type 2 diabetes is diagnosed.

Causes of type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn''t produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body''s cells don''t react to insulin. This means glucose stays in the blood and isn''t used as fuel for energy. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity and tends to be diagnosed in older people. It''s far more common than type 1 diabetes. Read about the causes and risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Treating type 2 diabetes As type 2 diabetes usually gets worse, you may eventually need medication – usually tablets – to keep your blood glucose at normal levels. Read more about the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Complications of type 2 diabetes Diabetes can cause serious long-term health problems. It''s the most common cause of vision loss and blindness in people of working age. Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year for diabetic retinopathy. Diabetes is also responsible for most cases of kidney failure and lower limb amputation, other than accidents. People with diabetes are up to five times more likely to have cardiovascular disease, such as a stroke, than those without diabetes. Read more about the complications of type 2 diabetes. Preventing type 2 diabetes If you''re at risk of type 2 diabetes, you may be able to prevent it developing by making lifestyle changes.

It may be triggered by bad posture while sitting or standing, bending awkwardly, or lifting incorrectly. It''s not generally caused by a serious condition. Find out more about the causes of back pain. In most cases back pain will improve in a few weeks or months, although some people experience long-term pain or pain that keeps coming back. Types of back pain Backache is most common in the lower back (lumbago), although it can be felt anywhere along your spine, from your neck down to your hips. Read information on neck pain and shoulder pain, which are covered separately. Sometimes back pain can be caused by an injury or disease, such as: a slipped disc – when one of the discs in the spine is damaged and presses on the nerves sciatica – irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve, which causes pain, numbness and tingling that travels down one leg whiplash – neck injury caused by a sudden impact frozen shoulder – inflammation around the shoulder that causes pain and stiffness ankylosing spondylitis – a long-term condition that causes pain and stiffness where the spine meets the pelvis The rest of this information will focus on back pain that doesn''t have an obvious cause. Doctors call this non-specific back pain. What to do Most cases of back pain get better on their own and you may not need to see a doctor. If you''ve only had back pain for a few days or weeks, the following advice may help relieve your symptoms and speed up your recovery: remain as active as possible and try to continue with your daily activities take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen if you feel you need to use hot or cold compression packs – you can buy these from your local pharmacy, or a bag of frozen vegetables and a hot water bottle will work just as well Although it can be difficult to be cheerful or optimistic if you are in pain, it''s important to stay positive as this can help you recover faster. Read more about treatments for short-term back pain. Treatments for long-term back pain If you''re worried about your back or your pain hasn''t improved by around six weeks, it''s a good idea to visit your GP, who can advise you about the treatments available. These include: stronger painkillers exercise classes – where you are taught specific exercises to strengthen your muscles and improve your posture manual therapy – such as physiotherapy, chiropractic or osteopathy acupuncture counselling – such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) support and advice at a specialist pain clinic Some people choose to see a therapist for manual therapy or acupuncture without seeing their GP first. If you want to do this, you will usually need to pay for private treatment, which is likely to cost around £30-50 for each appointment. Spinal surgery is usually only recommended when all else has failed. Read more about treating long-term back pain. Preventing back pain How you sit, stand, lie and lift can all affect the health of your back. Try to avoid placing too much pressure on your back and ensure it''s strong and supple. Regular exercise, such as walking and swimming, is an excellent way of preventing back pain. Activities such as yoga or pilates can improve your flexibility and strengthen your back muscles. See the back pain guide for advice about how to sit, stand and lift correctly to avoid backache, or read more about preventing back pain. Signs of a serious problem You should seek urgent medical help if you have back pain and: a high temperature (fever) unexplained weight loss a swelling or a deformity in your back it''s constant and doesn''t ease after lying down pain in your chest loss of bladder or bowel control an inability to pass urine numbness around your genitals, buttocks or back passage it''s worse at night it started after an accident, such as after a car accident These problems could be a sign of something more serious and need to be assessed as soon as possible.

It may be unpleasant and uncomfortable, but can usually be treated with medication available from pharmacies or on prescription from your GP. However, for some women, vaginal thrush can be difficult to treat and keeps coming back. This page covers: Symptoms of vaginal thrush What to do if you have vaginal thrush How to treat vaginal thrush What causes vaginal thrush? Preventing vaginal thrush Symptoms of vaginal thrush Typical symptoms of vaginal thrush include: itching and soreness around the entrance of the vagina (itchy labia) vaginal discharge – this is usually odourless and may be thick and white or thin and watery pain during sex, which may make you worry about having sex a stinging sensation when peeing Sometimes the skin around the vagina can be red, swollen or cracked. Occasionally there may also be sores on the skin, although this is more often a sign of genital herpes. You can use the vagina problems visual guide to help find out what could be causing your symptoms. What to do if you have vaginal thrush If you''ve had thrush before and think you have it again, you can normally treat it with medicines bought from a local pharmacy. See How to treat vaginal thrush below for more information. It''s a good idea to get medical advice from your GP or a sexual health clinic if: you have thrush for the first time you''re under the age of 16 or over 60 you''re pregnant or breastfeeding – read more about thrush in pregnancy you have unusual symptoms, such as coloured or smelly discharge, or sores on the skin around your vagina  you have abnormal vaginal bleeding or pain in your lower tummy you''ve had two episodes of thrush within the last six months you''ve reacted badly to antifungal treatment in the past, or it didn''t work you or your partner have previously had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and you think it might have returned your symptoms don''t improve after 7-14 days of treatment Thrush isn''t usually anything to worry about in these cases, but your doctor may want to take a swab from your vagina to confirm the diagnosis and/or carry out tests to check for any underlying cause. They can also advise you about the most suitable treatment and give you a prescription, if necessary. How to treat vaginal thrush Mild thrush can usually be treated with a short course of antifungal medication. The symptoms will usually clear up within a week or two. Treatment may need to be continued for longer if you have repeated bouts of thrush. Several thrush medicines can be bought over the counter from pharmacies, while others are only available on prescription from your GP. The main types are: pessaries – a special pill that you insert into your vagina using a special applicator intravaginal creams – these are also placed into the vagina using an applicator capsules – these are swallowed and may be more convenient to use than pessaries or intravaginal cream, but can have more troublesome side effects, such as vomiting or an upset stomach These treatments are all equally effective. You can usually choose the treatment you prefer, although pregnant or breastfeeding women shouldn''t take the capsules. You can also get creams to apply to the skin surrounding the entrance of your vagina. These can help relieve itchiness and soreness, although you may find that an ordinary emollient (moisturiser) works just as well. Read more about treating vaginal thrush. What causes vaginal thrush? Vaginal thrush is caused by yeasts from a group of fungi called Candida. Many women have Candida in their vagina without it causing any problems, but thrush can develop if the natural balance of micro-organisms in the vagina is disrupted and Candida multiplies. You''re more likely to get thrush if you: are in your twenties and thirties – thrush is less common in girls who haven''t started their periods and women who have been through the menopause are pregnant have sex when you''re not fully aroused or you''re worried it may hurt – this can lead to vaginal dryness and tightness during sex, which can trigger thrush take antibiotics have poorly controlled diabetes have a weakened immune system – for example, because of a condition such as HIV or a treatment such as chemotherapy Vaginal thrush isn''t classed as an STI, but it can be triggered by sex – particularly if you have trouble relaxing and your vagina is dry – and can occasionally be passed on to sexual partners. Preventing vaginal thrush If you get thrush frequently, you can: use water and an emollient (moisturiser) soap substitute to clean the skin around your vagina, but avoid cleaning this area more than once a day apply a greasier moisturiser to the skin around your vagina several times a day to protect it (but be aware that these moisturisers can weaken condoms) avoid potential irritants in perfumed soaps, shower gels, vaginal deodorants, wipes and douches avoid wearing tight-fitting underwear or tights – some women find that special silk underwear designed for people with eczema and thrush is helpful ensure your blood sugar level is kept under control, if you have diabetes Some women eat probiotic yoghurt or supplements to prevent vaginal thrush, but there''s little evidence to suggest this works.

Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you''re depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They''re wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression isn''t a sign of weakness or something you can "snap out of" by "pulling yourself together". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. How to tell if you have depression Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety. There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, unhappiness or anxiety during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. Read more about low mood and depression. If you''ve been feeling low for more than a few days, take this short test to find out if you''re depressed. When to see a doctor It''s important to seek help from your GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it''s best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery.

Sometimes there''s a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or even having a baby, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Read more about the causes of depression. Depression is fairly common, affecting about one in 10 people at some point during their life. It affects men and women, young and old. Studies have shown that about 4% of children aged five to 16 in the UK are anxious or depressed. Treating depression Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medication. Your recommended treatment will be based on whether you have mild, moderate or severe depression. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as "watchful waiting". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and self-help groups. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), are often used for mild depression that isn''t improving or moderate depression. Antidepressants are also sometimes prescribed. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medication. Read more about treating depression. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of the treatments for depression. Living with depression Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise, cutting down on alcohol, giving up smoking and eating healthily. Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Read more about the lifestyle changes you can make to help you beat depression.

Periods usually start to become less frequent over a few months or years before they stop altogether. Sometimes they can stop suddenly. The menopause is a natural part of ageing that usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age, as a woman''s oestrogen levels decline. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 51. However, around 1 in 100 women experience the menopause before 40 years of age. This is known as premature menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency. Symptoms of the menopause Most women will experience menopausal symptoms. Some of these can be quite severe and have a significant impact on your everyday activities. Common symptoms include: hot flushes  night sweats vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex difficulty sleeping low mood or anxiety reduced sex drive (libido) problems with memory and concentration Menopausal symptoms can begin months or even years before your periods stop and last around four years after your last period, although some women experience them for much longer. Read more about the symptoms of the menopause. When to see your GP It''s worth talking to your GP if you have menopausal symptoms that are troubling you or if you''re experiencing symptoms of the menopause before 45 years of age. Your GP can usually confirm whether you are menopausal based on your symptoms, but a blood test to measure your hormone levels may be carried out if you''re aged 40 to 45. Blood tests may also be carried out to help diagnose suspected premature menopause if you’re under 40 and have menopausal symptoms. Read more about how your GP can help during the menopause. Treatments for menopausal symptoms Your GP can offer treatments and suggest lifestyle changes if you have severe menopausal symptoms that interfere with your day-to-day life, including: hormone replacement therapy (HRT) – tablets, skin patches, gels and implants that relieve menopausal symptoms by replacing oestrogen vaginal oestrogen creams, lubricants or moisturisers for vaginal dryness cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – a type of talking therapy that can help with low mood and anxiety eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly – maintaining a healthy weight and staying fit and strong can improve some menopausal symptoms Your GP can refer you to a menopause specialist if your symptoms don''t improve after trying treatment or if you''re unable to take HRT. Read more about treating the menopause. What causes the menopause? The menopause is caused by a change in the balance of the body''s sex hormones, which occurs as you get older. It happens when your ovaries stop producing as much of the hormone oestrogen and no longer release an egg each month. Premature or early menopause can occur at any age, and in many cases, there''s no clear cause. Sometimes it''s caused by a treatment such as surgery to remove the ovaries (oophorectomy), some breast cancer treatments, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or it can be brought on by an underlying medical condition, such as Down''s syndrome or Addison''s disease.

Atopic eczema is more common in children, often developing before their first birthday. However, it may also develop for the first time in adults. It''s usually a long-term (chronic) condition, although it can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older. This topic covers: Symptoms When to seek medical advice Causes Treatment Other types of eczema Symptoms of atopic eczema Atopic eczema causes the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked, sore and red. Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body.             Although atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, it most often affects the hands, insides of the elbows, backs of the knees and the face and scalp in children. People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups). Read about the symptoms of atopic eczema  When to seek medical advice See your GP if you have symptoms of atopic eczema. They''ll usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions such as: whether the rash is itchy and where it appears when the symptoms first began whether it comes and goes over time whether there''s a history of atopic eczema in your family whether you have any other conditions, such as allergies or asthma whether something in your diet or lifestyle may be contributing to your symptoms Typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and three or more of the following: visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin – such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above generally dry skin in the last 12 months a history of asthma or hay fever – children under four must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has one of these conditions the condition started before the age of two (this does not apply to children under the age of four) Causes of atopic eczema The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it''s clear it is not down to one single thing. Atopic eczema often occurs in people who get allergies – "atopic" means sensitivity to allergens. It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever. The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather. Sometimes food allergies can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema. You may be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse. Allergy tests aren''t usually needed, although they''re sometimes helpful in identifying whether a food allergy may be triggering symptoms. Read about the causes of atopic eczema. Treating atopic eczema  Treatment for atopic eczema can help to relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time. However, there''s currently no cure and severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life, which may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally. There''s also an increased risk of skin infections.  Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including: self care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers emollients (moisturising treatments) – used on a daily basis for dry skin  topical corticosteroids – used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups Read about treating atopic eczema and complications of atopic eczema. Other types of eczema Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin. Other types of eczema include: discoid eczema – a type of eczema that occurs in circular or oval patches on the skin contact dermatitis – a type of eczema that occurs when the body comes into contact with a particular substance varicose eczema – a type of eczema that most often affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins seborrhoeic eczema – a type of eczema where red, scaly patches develop on the sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears and scalp dyshidrotic eczema (pompholyx) – a type of eczema that causes tiny blisters to erupt across the palms of the hands Page last reviewed: 02/12/2016 Next review due: 02/12/2019', 2051870139),

How do I take part in a clinical trial? Why join a clinical trial? Will I get paid? What happens in a clinical trial? What should I know before I sign up? How are trials regulated and judged ethical? How are trial results used to improve treatment? Where can I find results from trials that are relevant to me?  How do I take part in a clinical trial? You can ask your doctor or a patient organisation if they know of any clinical trials that you may be eligible to join. You can also search for information on a number of websites and register your interest in taking part in research. The main ones are described below. UK Clinical Trials Gateway The UK Clinical Trials Gateway (UKCTG) website pulls through information about clinical trials and other research from several different UK registers. If you sign up to it, researchers can contact you about research that might be suitable for you.  You can also search the UKCTG site in various ways to find trials relevant to you, and you can contact researchers yourself. WHO International Clinical Trials The World Health Organization''s Clinical Trials Search Portal provides access to clinical trials in countries all around the world. Charities For some conditions, you can find out about clinical trials from the websites of charities. Examples are: Arthritis Research UK: current clinical trials and studies Cancer Research UK: find a clinical trial   Multiple Sclerosis Society: MS clinical trials     Target Ovarian Cancer: clinical trials information centre Why join a clinical trial? Clinical trials help doctors understand how to treat a particular disease or condition. It may benefit you, or others like you, in the future. If you take part in a clinical trial, you may be one of the first people to benefit from a new treatment. However, there is also a chance that the new treatment turns out to be no better, or worse, than the standard treatment. To hear other people''s experiences of taking part in a clinical trial, visit healthtalk.org: clinical trials. Will I get paid? Some clinical trials offer payment, which can vary from hundreds to thousands of pounds depending on what is involved and expected from you. Some trials don''t offer payment and just cover your travel expenses. It''s important to find out about the inconvenience and risks involved before you sign up, and to carefully weigh up whether it is worth it. Bear in mind: it can be time consuming – you may be expected to attend a number of screening and follow-up sessions, and some trials require you to stay overnight there may be restrictions on what you can and cannot do – for example, you may be asked to not eat or drink alcohol for a period of time you may experience unknown side effects from the treatment What happens in a clinical trial? Testing a new medicine All clinical trials of new medicines go through a series of phases to test whether they are safe and whether they work. The medicines will usually be tested against another treatment called a control. This will either be a dummy treatment (a placebo) or a standard treatment already in use. Learn more about the placebo effect. Phase one trials: A small number of people, who may be healthy volunteers, are given the medicine. The drug is being trialled in human volunteers for the first time. Researchers test for side effects and calculate what the right dose might be to use in treatment. Researchers start with small doses and only increase the dose if the volunteers don''t experience any side effects, or if they only experience minor side effects. Phase two trials: The new medicine is tested on a larger group of people who are ill. This is to get a better idea of its effects in the short term. Phase three trials: Carried out on medicines that have passed phases one and two. The medicine is tested in larger groups of people who are ill, and compared against an existing treatment or a placebo to see if it''s better in practice and if it has important side effects. Trials often last a year or more and involve several thousand patients. Phase four trials: The safety, side effects and effectiveness of the medicine continue to be studied while it is being used in practice. Not required for every medicine. Only carried out on medicines that have passed all the previous stages and have been given marketing licences – a licence means the medicine can be made available on prescription. Control groups, randomisation and blinding If you take part in a clinical trial, you will usually be randomly assigned to either the: treatment group – where you''ll be given the treatment being assessed, or  control group – where you''ll be given an existing standard treatment, or a placebo if no proven standard treatment exists While the treatments are different in the two groups, researchers try to keep as many of the other conditions the same as possible. For example, both groups should have people of a similar age, with a similar proportion of men and women, who are in similar overall health. In most trials, a computer will be used to randomly decide which group each patient will be allocated to. Many trials are set up so nobody knows who''s been allocated to receive which treatment. This is known as blinding, and it helps reduce the effects of bias when comparing the outcomes of the treatments. What should I know before I sign up? When you express interest in a trial, a doctor or nurse is likely to tell you something about it in person. You''ll also be given some printed information to take away. You may come back with some questions you feel haven''t been answered. General questions What is the aim of the trial and how will it help people? Who is funding the trial? What treatment will I get if I do not take part in the trial? How long is the trial expected to last, and how long will I have to take part? How long will it be before the results of the trial are known? What will happen if I stop the trial treatment or leave the trial before it ends? What would happen if something went wrong? It''s rare for patients to be harmed by trial treatments, but you may want to ask about compensation if this were to happen. Practical questions How much of my time will be needed? Will I need to take time off work? Will I be paid? Will the costs of my travel to take part in the trial be covered? If the trial is testing a new drug, will I have to collect it from the hospital, will it be sent to me by post, or will I get it through my doctor? Will I have to complete questionnaires or keep a diary? What are the possible side effects of my treatment? How could the treatments affect me physically and emotionally? Who can I contact if I have a problem? Will someone be available 24 hours a day? How do I find out the results of the trial? Things to weigh up As with any treatment, you can''t be sure of the outcome. You may be given a new treatment that turns out not to be as effective as the standard treatment. Also, it''s possible you''ll experience unexpected side effects. And bear in mind that you may have to visit your place of treatment more often, or have more tests, treatments or monitoring, than you would if you were receiving the standard treatment in usual care. Leaving a trial You may decide to stop taking part in a trial if your condition is getting worse or if you feel the treatment isn''t helping you. You can also choose to leave at any point without giving a reason and without it affecting the care you receive. Results At the end of the trial, the researchers should publish the results and make them available to anyone who took part and wanted to know the results. If the researchers don''t offer you the results and you want to know, ask for them. Some research funders, such as the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), have websites where they publish the results of the research they have supported. How are trials regulated and judged ethical? Role of the MHRA Before a clinical trial of a new medicine can begin, a government agency called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) needs to review and authorise it. The MHRA inspects sites where trials take place to make sure they''re conducted in line with good clinical practice. Role of the HRA The Health Research Authority (HRA) works to protect and promote the interests of patients and the public in health research. It is responsible for research ethics committees up and down the country.  All medical research involving people in the UK, whether in the NHS or the private sector, first has to be approved by an independent research ethics committee. The committee protects the rights and interests of the people who will be in the trial. How are trial results used to improve treatment? Clinical trials can help: prevent illnesses by testing a vaccine detect or diagnose illnesses by testing a scan or blood test treat illnesses by testing new or existing medicines find out how best to provide psychological support  find out how people can control their symptoms or improve their quality of life – for example, by testing how a particular diet affects a condition Many clinical trials are designed to show whether new medicines work as expected. These results are sent to the MHRA, which decides whether to allow the company making the medicine to market it for a particular use. Licensing a treatment If research has identified a new medicine, the MHRA must license it before it can be marketed. Licensing shows a treatment has met certain standards of safety and effectiveness. Safety must be monitored carefully over the first few years of a newly licensed treatment. This is because rare side effects that weren''t obvious in clinical trials may show up for the first time. In England and Wales, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) decides whether the NHS should provide treatments. Where can I find results from trials that are relevant to me? The results of clinical trials are usually published in specialist medical journals and online libraries of evidence. Some of the most well-known examples are: The Lancet medical journal British Medical Journal (BMJ) The New England Journal of Medicine Cochrane Library – a collection of high-quality evidence NHS Evidence database You can use a search engine such as Google to look for articles and read summaries (abstracts). But you can''t usually see the full articles without a subscription to the journal. Also, research papers are not written in plain English and often use many medical, scientific and statistical terms. They can be very difficult to understand. Coverage in newspapers You''ll often see stories about research findings in mainstream media. But while news stories are easier to read than original research papers, sometimes the findings are exaggerated or sensationalised. The NHS website aims to make this clearer for you. Behind the Headlines is an independent service that analyses health stories that make the news.  It aims to explain the facts behind the headlines and give a better understanding of the research that was carried out.

Children with croup have a distinctive barking cough and will make a harsh sound, known as stridor, when they breathe in. They may also have a hoarse voice and find it difficult to breathe because their airway is blocked. Croup can usually be diagnosed by a GP and treated at home. However, if your child’s symptoms are severe and they are finding it difficult to breathe, take them to the nearest hospital’s accident and emergency (A&E) department. Read more about the symptoms of croup and diagnosing croup. Why does croup happen? Commonly, croup is caused by a virus. Several viruses can cause croup but in most cases it is the parainfluenza virus. Read more about the causes of croup. Who is affected by croup? Croup usually affects young children aged between six months and three years, with most cases occurring in one-year-olds.  However, croup can sometimes develop in babies as young as three months, and older children up to 15 years of age. Adults can also get croup but this is rare. The condition is more common during the late autumn and early winter months.  It tends to affect more boys than girls. A child may experience croup more than once during childhood. Treating croup Most cases of croup are mild and can be treated at home. Sitting your child upright and comforting them if they are distressed is important, because crying may make symptoms worse. Your child should also drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. A single dose of an oral corticosteroid medication called dexamethasone or prednisolone will usually also be prescribed to help reduce the swelling in the throat. If your child has breathing problems they may need hospital treatment, such as adrenaline and oxygen through a mask. Read more about treating croup. Complications Most cases of croup clear up within 48 hours. However, in some cases symptoms can last for up to two weeks. It is extremely rare for a child to die from croup. There are a number of conditions that can follow croup, such as pneumonia and middle ear infection. Read more about the complications of croup. Preventing croup Croup is spread in a similar way to the common cold, so it is difficult to prevent. Good hygiene is the main defence against croup, such as regularly washing hands and cleaning surfaces. A number of your child''s routine vaccinations also protect against some of the infections that can cause croup. These include: MMR – protection from measles, mumps and rubella DTaP/IPV/Hib – protection from diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b Croup is a distinctive bark-like cough with a harsh sound known as stridor when breathing in   Community content from HealthUnlocked Pregnancy and baby All you need to know about pregnancy, birth and looking after a baby, including feeding and trying to get pregnant Page last reviewed: 28/08/2014 Next review due: 28/08/2017', 428014547),

Children with the condition can have heart defects, learning difficulties, a cleft palate and potentially many other problems.

How does the mutation happen?  How is DiGeorge syndrome diagnosed?  What are the chances of my next child having it?  What help and support is available?  What is the outlook? Information about you What are the main features of DiGeorge syndrome?  DiGeorge syndrome can potentially cause many different problems affecting various areas of the body. The main features are described below, but bear in mind that the severity of these problems varies from child to child and some children with the syndrome will only experience a few of them.  Heart problems Most children with DiGeorge syndrome have heart abnormalities from birth, such as a hole in the heart or a problem with the main artery leaving the heart (the aorta). Many children will have four specific structural abnormalities of the heart, collectively known as ''tetralogy of Fallot''. These are: pulmonary stenosis – narrowing between the right heart chamber and the main blood vessel (pulmonary artery) that carries blood from the heart to the lungs  ventricular septal defect – a hole between the right and left pumping chambers (ventricles) of the heart  over-riding aorta – the entrance to the aorta is next to the ventricular septal defect, allowing low-oxygen blood to flow through it thick right ventricle – the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the narrowed pulmonary artery, causing the muscle to thicken A doctor will carry out an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to check if your child has these heart problems. Surgery may be needed to correct some of them. Read more about congenital heart disease. Learning difficulties Commonly, children with DiGeorge syndrome will have slow development of speech and poor concentration, and may struggle with maths and problem solving as they grow up. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder are fairly common, which can make learning even more difficult. The earlier any learning difficulties are noticed the better, as prompt treatment can reduce their impact and allow parents and teachers to organise any special help needed at nursery or school. Problems with the mouth, feeding and hearing Some children with DiGeorge syndrome have a cleft palate (hole in the roof of their mouth) and many more will have a problem with the surrounding mouth muscles. A few will also have a cleft lip (split in the upper lip). Read more about cleft lips and palates. These problems can result in: difficulty with speech and language and a "nasal" voice feeding problems – they may find it hard to chew and swallow solids (dysphagia), may occasionally regurgitate food through their nose when swallowing, and typically do not put on much weight ear infections such as glue ear, which may lead to temporary hearing loss Appearance Children with DiGeorge syndrome tend to have the following features: a long, narrow face wide-set, almond-shaped eyes  a broad nasal bridge and bulbous nose tip a small mouth small, low-set ears that are folded over at the top a cleft lip a cleft palate an irregular skull shape (craniosynostosis) Many of these features will become easier to spot as the child gets older. Infections Children with DiGeorge syndrome generally have weak immune systems because of a problem with the thymus gland – a gland in the chest that produces cells needed to fight invading germs. It means they may be susceptible to recurrent infections such as oral thrush and pneumonia. However, immune system problems often improve with age and routine childhood vaccinations should normally be given to prevent several serious infections. Hormone and growth problems Many children with DiGeorge syndrome also have an underactive parathyroid gland, known as hypoparathyroidism. There are four tiny parathyroid glands, each the size of a grain of rice, in the neck behind the thyroid gland. They produce parathyroid hormone to help control the levels of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D in the bones and blood. An underactive gland causes low levels of calcium in the blood, which can cause problems such as tremors and seizures (fits), although these are unusual after infancy. Calcium supplements may be given to treat this. Some children may also be short for their age because of a growth hormone deficiency, and they may have an underactive thyroid gland. Emotional and mental health problems Children with DiGeorge syndrome may find it difficult to make friends with children their own age and may avoid making eye contact. They may have rapid mood swings, swinging from quietness to hyperactivity, and have unexpected temper tantrums. Teenagers and adults with DiGeorge syndrome are more likely to develop depression and other psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia. Bone and muscle problems Bone and muscle problems are fairly common in people with DiGeorge syndrome. Problems that can occur include: reduced muscle tone or "floppiness" (hypotonia) abnormalities of the spine, such as a curved spine (scoliosis) clumsy walking or hand movements recurrent leg pains rheumatoid arthritis weak muscles, resulting in hernias and constipation (as the gut muscles don''t work very well) a high shoulder blade club foot over-flexible joints (joint hypermobility) undescended testicles  Eye problems Possible eye problems include a squint (where the eyes point in different directions), a hole in the iris of the eye known as coloboma, and childhood cataracts – although these won''t always need treating. Kidney problems It''s quite common for a child with DiGeorge syndrome to have a missing kidney, or for one kidney to be smaller than the other. An ultrasound scan will pick this up. This shouldn''t cause any problems and no treatment is necessary. What is 22q11 deletion? Chromosomes are X-shaped strands of genes, which provide instructions for a person''s characteristics. Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes – one of each pair from their mother, and the other from their father. Each chromosome has a long arm (referred to as ''q'') and a short arm (''p''). In 22q11 deletion, a tiny part of the long arm of chromosome 22 is missing (at position 11). 22q11 is responsible for a wide range of syndromes and conditions, ranging from mild to severe. DiGeorge syndrome is at the more severe end of the range. Scientists are not sure why the same missing piece of chromosome can result in different genetic syndromes. How does the mutation happen?  In most cases of DiGeorge syndrome, the missing piece of chromosome would already have been missing from the egg or sperm from which the baby was conceived. This can happen by chance when DNA is copied to make sperm and eggs and it can''t be predicted or prevented. In these cases, there is usually no family history of the condition.  In around 10% of cases, the 22q11 deletion will have been passed on to the child by one of the parents who has the mutation themselves.   How is DiGeorge syndrome diagnosed?  The piece of missing chromosome that causes DiGeorge syndrome is so small that it cannot be seen under a microscope. Instead, a special test called the FISH test (fluorescence in situ hybridisation) will be needed to diagnose the condition. This test shows whether the region of chromosome 22 is present. If only one copy of chromosome 22 ''lights up'' with fluorescent DNA dye, rather than both copies, the test is positive for 22q11 deletion. The FISH test can be carried out to diagnose an unborn baby using a sample of cells from the placenta (chorionic villus sampling) or a sample of fluid surrounding the baby (amniocentesis). It can be carried out using a blood sample in children and adults. However, this test doesn''t pick up every case of DiGeorge syndrome. Some people will need to have more advanced DNA tests and occasionally the diagnosis may be solely made on the characteristic features and symptoms. What are the chances of my next child having it?  A parent with DiGeorge syndrome has a 50% chance of passing on the condition to their child. This applies in each pregnancy. If neither parent has the condition, the risk of having another child with it is around 1%. If you''re at risk of having a baby with DiGeorge syndrome, you should be referred for genetic counselling to discuss the level of risk and what your options are. The earliest an unborn baby can be tested in pregnancy is at 10-12 weeks, by chorionic villus sampling. Testing is also available by amniocentesis from 15-16 weeks onwards. It''s important to be aware, however, that these tests cannot predict how severely a child with 22q11 deletion will be affected. Find out more about genetic testing and counselling. What help and support is available?  There''s no cure for DiGeorge syndrome, but many of the problems experienced by people with the condition can be monitored and treated if necessary. Your child will have regular tests from infancy onwards, including: hearing tests and eye examinations blood tests to check hormone and calcium levels medical tests of their immune system kidney and heart scans and tests Before they start school, your child''s developmental progress and speech and language development should be carefully assessed. If your child has a learning disability, their educational needs can be met either in a mainstream school with extra support, or in a special school. Read more about education for children with learning disabilities. A physiotherapist can help with any physical problems – for example, shoe inserts (orthoses) may help your child''s leg pains. Read more about physiotherapy. Speech therapy can help with speech problems, and dietary changes or tube feeding may be needed temporarily to help with swallowing or feeding difficulties. Surgery may be needed to correct any severe problems, such as heart surgery or an operation to reduce the amount of air escaping through their nose (if your child''s speech is very nasal). You may find it useful to discuss your concerns with a social worker, psychologist or counsellor, who you can contact directly or via your doctor. Read more about caring for a disabled child and childcare options for disabled children.  Self-help groups such as the Max Appeal may also be a good source of information and support. What is the outlook? Nowadays, most children with DiGeorge syndrome will survive into adulthood – particularly if heart problems are detected and treated early on. Less than 5% of babies die before their first birthday. As a child with DiGeorge syndrome gets older, physical features such as heart and speech problems tend to become less of an issue, but behavioural, learning and mental health problems may affect daily life. Many of those who reach adulthood will have a relatively normal life span, although for some people, ongoing health problems mean their life expectancy is lower than the average. Regular check-ups are necessary to monitor the condition. Adults with DiGeorge syndrome are often able to live independently and have jobs, although some people experience social isolation and employment problems as a result of their condition. Information about your child If your child has DiGeorge syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about him or her on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. Related conditions As well as DiGeorge syndrome, several other conditions can be caused by 22q11 deletion. One of the main other types of 22q11 deletion is velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS). VCFS generally has many similar symptoms to DiGeorge syndrome, including problems with the structure and function of the palate ("velo" refers to the roof of the mouth) and heart problems from birth, but these tend to be less severe.

There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes – where the body''s immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin type 2 diabetes – where the body doesn''t produce enough insulin, or the body''s cells don''t react to insulin Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. In the UK, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2. During pregnancy, some women have such high levels of blood glucose that their body is unable to produce enough insulin to absorb it all. This is known as gestational diabetes. Pre-diabetes Many more people have blood sugar levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes. This is sometimes known as pre-diabetes. If your blood sugar level is above the normal range, your risk of developing full-blown diabetes is increased. It''s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it will get progressively worse if left untreated. When to see a doctor Visit your GP as soon as possible if you experience the main symptoms of diabetes, which include: feeling very thirsty urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night feeling very tired weight loss and loss of muscle bulk itching around the penis or vagina, or frequent episodes of thrush cuts or wounds that heal slowly blurred vision Type 1 diabetes can develop quickly over weeks or even days. Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because the early symptoms tend to be general.

Causes of diabetes The amount of sugar in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach). When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it''s broken down to produce energy. However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there''s either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced doesn''t work properly. Although there are no lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes is often linked to being overweight. Read about how to reduce your diabetes risk. Living with diabetes If you''re diagnosed with diabetes, you''ll need to eat healthily, take regular exercise and carry out regular blood tests to ensure your blood glucose levels stay balanced. You can use the BMI healthy weight calculator to check whether you''re a healthy weight. People diagnosed with type 1 diabetes also require regular insulin injections for the rest of their life. As type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, medication may eventually be required, usually in the form of tablets. Read about:  Treating type 1 diabetes Treating type 2 diabetes Living with diabetes Diabetic eye screening Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year. If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it''s not treated. Screening, which involves a half-hour check to examine the back of the eyes, is a way of detecting the condition early so it can be treated more effectively. Read more about diabetic eye screening.

About the yellow fever vaccine The yellow fever vaccine is given as a single injection.   You should be vaccinated at least 10 days before you travel, as this will allow enough time for your body to develop protection against the yellow fever infection. Your proof of vaccination certificate (see below) will only become valid after this time. The vaccination provides protection for 95-100% of those who have it. This protection lasts at least 10 years and may even be life-long. Booster doses of yellow fever vaccine Booster doses of the yellow fever vaccine used to be recommended every 10 years for everyone planning another visit to an area where the infection is found. However, experts working for the World Health Organization (WHO) recently suggested that booster doses may not be necessary. Since July 2016, vaccination certificates have been valid for life (they previously expired after 10 years). For the time being, booster doses are only recommended if you are travelling to an at-risk area, you were last vaccinated more than 10 years ago, and: you need a valid certificate of vaccination, or you were originally vaccinated when you were pregnant, were less than two years old, or had a weakened immune system (for example, due to an HIV infection or preparation for a bone marrow transplant) Your local designated yellow fever vaccination centre (see below) should be able to advise you if you’re not sure whether you need to have a booster vaccination before travelling. Where can I be vaccinated against yellow fever? Yellow fever vaccinations can only be given at designated centres. For a centre to become a designated yellow fever vaccination centre, it must register with the appropriate authority. In the UK, this is either: the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) Health Protection Scotland (HPS) Find your nearest yellow fever vaccination centre. The vaccination is not usually available for free on the NHS, so you will normally have to pay for it. On average, a single vaccination costs around £60. Certificate of yellow fever vaccination Under regulations set out by the WHO, anyone travelling to a country or area where there is a risk of picking up or spreading the virus that causes yellow fever must have an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP). You can find a list of all the countries that require you to have an ICVP (PDF, 436kb) on the WHO website. You can also search the destination information on the NHS Fit for Travel website to find out whether the places you are visiting require an ICVP. An ICVP is not required for entry into the UK. If you lose your certificate, you may be able to get another one reissued as long as you have details of the vaccination batch number and the date you had the vaccination. Exemption from yellow fever vaccination Some people may be advised not to have the yellow fever vaccine because of the risk of potential side effects or complications. This includes: babies under nine months of age – babies who are six to nine months old may sometimes be vaccinated, but only if the risk of getting yellow fever during travel is unavoidable pregnant and breastfeeding women people over 60 years of age people with weakened immune systems – such as people with HIV and those receiving radiotherapy people who are severely allergic to any of the ingredients in the vaccine – including people with allergies to eggs, as the vaccine contains small amounts of egg If the yellow fever vaccination is not advised, you may be issued with an exemption letter, which may be accepted by immigration authorities. If you have not been vaccinated, you will need to take particular care to prevent mosquito bites while travelling – for example, by using insect repellent and mosquito nets. Side effects of the yellow fever vaccine Up to one in every three people experience mild side effects after having the yellow fever vaccine, such as: a headache muscle pain a mild fever soreness at the injection site Reactions at the injection site usually occur one to five days after being vaccinated. The other side effects may last for up to two weeks. Rare side effects of the yellow fever vaccine There are also some very rare, but potentially serious, side effects that can occur, including: an allergic reaction to the vaccine; this occurs around once for every 130,000 doses given yellow fever vaccine-associated neurological disease (YEL-AND) – a condition affecting the brain and nervous system, causing symptoms such as confusion and problems with movement and co-ordination; this occurs around once for every 250,000 doses given yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) – a condition affecting your internal organs, which can lead to organ failure in some cases; this occurs around once for every 330,000 doses given The risk of YEL-AND and YEL-AVD is higher in young babies and elderly people, which is why vaccination is not always recommended for these groups.

(224, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dyslexia/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Dyslexia', 'Dyslexia - NHS Choices', 'Dyslexia  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Dyslexia is a common learning difficulty that can cause problems with reading, writing and spelling. It''s a "specific learning difficulty", which means it causes problems with certain abilities used for learning, such as reading and writing. Unlike a learning disability, intelligence isn''t affected. It''s estimated that up to 1 in every 10 to 20 people in the UK has some degree of dyslexia. Dyslexia is lifelong problem that can present challenges on a daily basis, but support is available to improve reading and writing skills and help those with the problem be successful at school and work. What are the signs of dyslexia? Signs of dyslexia usually become apparent when a child starts school and begins to focus more on learning how to read and write. A person with dyslexia may: read and write very slowly confuse the order of letters in words put letters the wrong way round – such as writing "b" instead of "d" have poor or inconsistent spelling understand information when told verbally, but have difficulty with information that''s written down find it hard to carry out a sequence of directions struggle with planning and organisation However, people with dyslexia often have good skills in other areas, such as creative thinking and problem solving. Read more about the symptoms of dyslexia. Getting help If you think your child may have dyslexia, the first step is to speak to their teacher or their school''s special needs coordinator (SENCO) about your concerns. They may be able to offer additional support to help your child if necessary. If your child continues to have problems despite extra support, you or the school may want to consider requesting a more in-depth assessment from a specialist dyslexia teacher or an educational psychologist. This can be arranged through the school, or you can request a private assessment by contacting: an educational psychologist directly – you can find a directory of chartered psychologists on the British Psychological Society''s website a voluntary organisation that can arrange an assessment, such as Dyslexia Action or a local dyslexia association Adults who wish to be assessed for dyslexia should contact a local or national dyslexia association (see below) for advice. Read more about how dyslexia is diagnosed Support for people with dyslexia If your child has dyslexia, they''ll probably need extra educational support from their school. With appropriate support, there''s usually no reason your child can''t go to a mainstream school, although a small number of children may benefit from attending a specialist school. Techniques and support that may help your child include: occasional one-to-one teaching or lessons in a small group with a specialist teacher phonics – a special learning technique that focuses on improving the ability to identify and process the smaller sounds that make up words technology, such as computers and speech recognition software, that may make it easier for your child to read and write when they''re a bit older Universities also have specialist staff who can support young people with dyslexia in higher education. Technology such as word processors and electronic organisers can be useful for adults too. Employers are required to make reasonable adjustments to the workplace to help people with dyslexia, such as allowing extra time for certain tasks. Read more about how dyslexia is managed. Support groups As well as national dyslexia charities, such as Dyslexia Action and the British Dyslexia Association (BDA), there are several local dyslexia associations (LDAs). These are independently registered charities that run workshops and help to provide local support and access to information. You can find your local LDA on the BDA website. What causes dyslexia? People with dyslexia find it difficult to recognise the different sounds that make up words and relate these to letters.  Dyslexia isn''t related to a person''s general level of intelligence. Children and adults of all intellectual abilities can be affected by dyslexia. The exact cause of dyslexia is unknown, but it often appears to run in families. In people with dyslexia, it''s thought that certain genes inherited from your parents may act together in a way that affects how some parts of brain develop during early life.

It usually causes a bright red rash on the cheeks. Although the rash can look alarming, slapped cheek syndrome is normally a mild infection that clears up by itself in one to three weeks. Once you''ve had the infection, you''re usually immune to it for life. However, slapped cheek syndrome can be more serious for some people. If you''re pregnant, have a blood disorder or a weakened immune system and have been exposed to the virus, you should get medical advice. This page covers: Symptoms When to get medical advice What to do if you or your child has it How you get it Prevention Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome usually develop 4-14 days after becoming infected, but sometimes may not appear for up to 21 days. Initial symptoms Some people with slapped cheek syndrome won''t notice any early symptoms, but most people will have the following symptoms for a few days: a slightly high temperature (fever) of around 38C (100.4F) a runny nose  a sore throat a headache an upset stomach feeling generally unwell The infection is most contagious during this initial period. In adults, these symptoms are often accompanied by joint pain and stiffness, which may continue for several weeks or even months after the other symptoms have passed. Slapped cheek rash After a few days, a distinctive bright red rash on both cheeks (the so-called "slapped cheeks") normally appears, although adults may not get this. By the time this rash develops, the condition is no longer contagious. After another few days, a light pink rash may also appear on the chest, stomach, arms and thighs. This often has a raised, lace-like appearance and may be itchy. The rashes will normally fade within a week or two, although occasionally the body rash may come and go for a few weeks after the infection has passed. This can be triggered by exercise, heat, anxiety or stress. When to get medical advice You don''t usually need to see your GP if you think you or your child has slapped cheek syndrome, as the condition normally gets better on its own. However, you should contact your GP, call NHS 111 or contact your local out-of-hours service if you have been exposed to anyone with slapped cheek or you have symptoms of the infection and: you''re pregnant – infection in pregnancy, particularly early pregnancy, carries a risk of causing miscarriage, stillbirth or other complications; however, this risk is small and most pregnant women will already be immune (read more about the risks of slapped cheek syndrome in pregnancy) you have a blood disorder, such as sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia, or a weakened immune system – the infection can cause severe anaemia that may need to be treated in hospital you have symptoms of severe anaemia, such as very pale skin, severe shortness of breath, extreme tiredness or fainting In these cases, a blood test may be carried out to see if you''re immune to the infection. If you''re not immune, you''ll be monitored carefully to check for any problems. If you develop severe anaemia, it''s likely that you''ll need to be admitted to hospital and have a blood transfusion to replace your damaged blood cells. What to do if you or your child has slapped cheek Slapped cheek syndrome is usually mild and should clear up without specific treatment. If you or your child is feeling unwell, you can try the following to ease the symptoms: rest and drink plenty of fluids – babies should continue their normal feeds for a fever, headaches or joint pain, you can take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen – children under 16 shouldn''t take aspirin to reduce itchiness, you can take antihistamines or use an emollient (moisturising lotion) – some antihistamines are not suitable for young children, so check with your pharmacist first Unless you or your child is feeling unwell, there’s no need to stay away from school or work once the rash has developed, as the infection is no longer contagious by this point. It''s a good idea to notify your child''s school about the infection, so children who develop early symptoms can be spotted quickly and vulnerable people can be made aware that they may need to get medical advice. How do you get slapped cheek syndrome? Slapped cheek syndrome is caused by a virus called parvovirus B19. This is found in the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of someone with the infection. The virus is spread in a similar way to colds and flu. You can become infected by:  inhaling droplets that are sneezed or coughed out by someone with the infection touching a contaminated surface or object and then touching your mouth or nose Someone with slapped cheek syndrome is infectious during the period before the rash develops. Once the rash appears, the condition can no longer be passed on. Preventing slapped cheek syndrome It''s very difficult to prevent slapped cheek syndrome, because people who have the infection are most contagious before they develop any obvious symptoms. However, making sure that everyone in your household washes their hands frequently may help stop the infection from spreading. There''s currently no vaccine available to protect you against the condition. Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 13/10/2015 Next review due: 01/10/2018', 423850798),

The impulsive, fearless and chaotic behaviours typical of ADHD can make normal everyday activities exhausting and stressful. Ways to cope Although it can be difficult at times, it''s important to remember that a child with ADHD can''t help their behaviour. People with ADHD find it difficult to suppress impulses, which means they don''t stop to consider a situation or the consequences before they act. If you''re looking after a child with ADHD, you may find the below advice helpful. Plan the day Plan the day so your child knows what to expect. Set routines can make a difference to how a child with ADHD copes with everyday life. For example, if your child has to get ready for school, break it down into structured steps, so they know exactly what they need to do. Set clear boundaries Make sure everyone knows what behaviour is expected, and reinforce positive behaviour with immediate praise or rewards. Be clear, using enforceable consequences if boundaries are overstepped (such as taking away a privilege) and follow these through consistently. Be positive Give specific praise. Instead of saying a general, "Thanks for doing that," you could say, "You washed the dishes really well. Thank you." This will make it clear to your child that you''re pleased, and why. Giving instructions If you''re asking your child to do something, give brief instructions and be specific. Instead of asking, "Can you tidy your bedroom?" say, "Please put your toys into the box, and put the books back onto the shelf." This makes it clearer what your child needs to do and creates opportunities for praise when they get it right. Incentive scheme Set up your own incentive scheme using a points chart or star chart, so good behaviour can earn a privilege. For example, behaving well on a shopping trip will earn your child time on the computer or some sort of game. Involve your child in it and allow them to help decide what the privileges will be. These charts need regular changes or they become boring. Targets should be: immediate (for example, daily) intermediate (for example, weekly) long-term (for example, three-monthly) Try to focus on just one or two behaviours at a time. Intervene early Watch for warning signs. If your child looks like they''re becoming frustrated, overstimulated and about to lose self-control, intervene. Distract your child if possible, by taking them away from the situation, which may calm them down. Social situations Keep social situations short and sweet. Invite friends to play, but keep playtimes short, so your child doesn''t lose self-control. Don''t aim to do this when your child is feeling tired or hungry, such as after a day at school. Exercise Make sure your child gets lots of physical activity during the day. Walking, skipping and playing sport can help your child wear themselves out and improve their quality of sleep. Make sure they''re not doing anything too strenuous or exciting near to bedtime. Read our page on health and fitness, which includes information on getting active, and how much activity you and your child should be doing. Eating Keep an eye on what your child eats. If your child is hyperactive after eating certain foods, which may contain additives or caffeine, keep a diary of these and discuss them with your GP. Bedtime Stick to a routine. Make sure your child goes to bed at the same time each night and gets up at the same time in the morning. Avoid overstimulating activities in the hours before bedtime, such as computer games or watching TV. Night time Sleep problems and ADHD can be a vicious circle. ADHD can lead to sleep problems, which in turn can make symptoms worse. Many children with ADHD will repeatedly get up after being put to bed and have interrupted sleep patterns. Trying a sleep-friendly routine can help your child and make bedtime less of a battleground. Read more information about creating a bedtime ritual for better sleep. Help at school Children with ADHD often have problems with their behaviour at school, and the condition can have a negative impact on a child''s academic progress. Speak to your child''s teachers or their school''s special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) about any extra support your child may need. Adults with ADHD If you''re an adult living with ADHD, you may find the following advice useful: Make lists, keep diaries, stick up reminders and set aside some time to plan what you need to do if you find it hard to stay organised. Let off steam by exercising regularly. Find ways to help you relax, such as listening to music or learning relaxation techniques. If you have a job, speak to your employer about your condition, and discuss anything they can do to help you work better. Talk to your doctor about your suitability to drive, as you''ll need to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) if your ADHD affects your driving. Contact or join a local or national support group – these organisations can put you in touch with other people in a similar situation, and they can be a good source of support, information and advice. For more advice, you can read about living with ADHD on the AADD-UK website. AADD-UK is a charity specifically for adults with ADHD. AADD-UK also has a list of adult support groups across the UK.

It''s more serious than cystitis, a common infection of the bladder that makes urinating painful. If treated promptly, a kidney infection doesn''t cause serious harm, but will make you feel very unwell. If a kidney infection isn''t treated, it can get worse and cause permanent kidney damage. Symptoms of a kidney infection often come on within a few hours. You can feel feverish, shivery, sick and have a pain in your back or side. Read more about the symptoms of a kidney infection. When to see your GP See your GP if you have a fever and persistent tummy, lower back or genital pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination. Most kidney infections need prompt treatment with antibiotics to stop the infection from damaging the kidneys or spreading to the bloodstream. You may also need painkillers. If you''re especially vulnerable to the effects of an infection – for example, if you have a pre-existing health condition or are pregnant, you may be admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotics through an intravenous drip. After taking antibiotics, you should feel completely better after about two weeks. In rare cases, a kidney infection can cause further problems. These include blood poisoning (sepsis) and a build-up of pus in the kidney called an abscess. Read more about treating a kidney infection and the complications of a kidney infection. What causes a kidney infection? A kidney infection usually happens when bacteria – often a type called E. coli – gets into the urethra (the tube which carries urine out of the body) and travels up through the bladder and into the kidneys. Read more about the causes of a kidney infection. Who''s at risk? Kidney infections are relatively rare. It''s estimated that one in every 830 people develops a kidney infection each year in the UK. They can happen at any age, but are much more common in women. In fact, women are six times more likely to get a kidney infection than men. This is because a woman''s urethra is shorter, making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys. Younger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active, and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection. Younger children are also vulnerable to developing kidney infections because they may be born with an abnormality of the urinary tract or have a condition called vesico-ureteric reflux, where there is a backflow of urine from the bladder up to the kidneys. Can kidney infections be prevented? You can reduce your chances of developing a kidney infection by keeping your bladder and urethra free from bacteria. This can include drinking plenty of fluids, keeping your genitals clean and treating any constipation. Read more about preventing a kidney infection.

Genetics ADHD tends to run in families and, in most cases, it''s thought the genes you inherit from your parents are a significant factor in developing the condition. Research shows that both parents and siblings of a child with ADHD are four to five times more likely to have ADHD themselves. However, the way ADHD is inherited is likely to be complex and isn''t thought to be related to a single genetic fault. Brain function and structure Research has identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared to those who don''t have the condition, although the exact significance of these isn''t clear. For example, studies involving brain scans have suggested that certain areas of the brain may be smaller in people with ADHD, whereas other areas may be larger. Research has also shown that the brain may take an average of two to three years longer to mature in children with ADHD, compared to children who don''t have the condition. Other studies have suggested that people with ADHD may have an imbalance in the level of neurotransmitters in the brain, or that these chemicals may not work properly. Other possible causes Various other causes have also been suggested as playing a role in the development of ADHD, including: being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) having a low birthweight brain damage either in the womb or in the first few years of life drinking alcohol, smoking or misusing drugs while pregnant exposure to high levels of toxic lead at a young age However, the evidence for many of these factors is inconclusive, and more research is needed to determine if they contribute to ADHD.

Vaccinations are available to protect you against infections such as yellow fever, typhoid and hepatitis A. In the UK, the childhood vaccination programme protects you against a number of diseases, but doesn''t cover most of the infectious diseases found overseas. Which jabs do I need? You can find out which vaccinations are necessary or recommended for the areas you''ll be visiting on these two websites: NHS fitfortravel the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) Some countries require you to have an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP) before you enter. For example, Saudi Arabia requires proof of vaccination against certain types of meningitis for visitors arriving for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. Many tropical countries in Africa and South America won''t accept travellers from an area where there''s yellow fever unless they can prove they''ve been vaccinated against it. Read more about the vaccines available for travellers abroad. Where do I get my jabs? You should get advice at least eight weeks before you''re due to travel, as some jabs need to be given well in advance. First, phone or visit your GP or practice nurse to find out whether your existing UK jabs are up-to-date (they can tell from your notes). Your GP or practice nurse may also be able to give you general advice about travel vaccinations and travel health, such as protecting yourself from malaria. Your GP or practice nurse can give you a booster of your UK jabs if you need one. They may be able to give you the travel jabs you need, either free on the NHS or for a charge. Alternatively, you can visit a local private travel vaccination clinic for your UK boosters and other travel jabs. Not all vaccinations are available free on the NHS, even if they''re recommended for travel to a certain area. Free travel vaccinations The following travel vaccinations are usually available free on the NHS: diphtheria, polio and tetanus (combined booster) typhoid hepatitis A – including when combined with typhoid or hepatitis B cholera These vaccines are usually free because they protect against diseases thought to represent the greatest risk to public health if they were brought into the country. Private travel vaccinations You''re likely to have to pay for travel vaccinations against: hepatitis B when not combined with hepatitis A Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis meningitis vaccines  rabies tuberculosis (TB) yellow fever Yellow fever vaccines are only available from designated centres. The NaTHNaC website can help you find a clinic offering yellow fever vaccination. The cost of travel vaccines at private clinics will vary, but could be around £50 for each dose of a vaccine. It''s worth considering this when budgeting for your trip. Things to consider There are several things to consider when planning your travel vaccinations, including: the country or countries you''re visiting – some diseases are more common in certain parts of the world and less common in others  when you''re travelling – some diseases are more common at certain times of the year; for example, during the rainy season where you''re staying – in general, you''ll be more at risk of disease in rural areas than in urban areas, and if you''re backpacking and staying in hostels or camping, you may be more at risk than if you were on a package holiday and staying in a hotel how long you''ll be staying – the longer your stay, the greater your risk of being exposed to diseases your age and health – some people may be more vulnerable to infection than others, while some vaccinations can''t be given to people with certain medical conditions what you''ll be doing during your stay – for example, whether you''ll be spending a lot of time outdoors, such as trekking or working in rural areas if you''re working as an aid worker – you may come into contact with more diseases if you''re working in a refugee camp or helping after a natural disaster if you''re working in a medical setting – for example, a doctor or nurse may require additional vaccinations if you are in contact with animals – in this case, you may be more at risk of getting diseases spread by animals, such as rabies If you''re only travelling to countries in northern and central Europe, North America or Australia, you''re unlikely to need any vaccinations. If possible, see your GP at least eight weeks before you''re due to travel. Some vaccinations need to be given well in advance to allow your body to develop immunity. Some also involve multiple doses spread over several weeks. Pregnancy and breastfeeding Speak to your GP before having any vaccinations if: you''re pregnant you think you might be pregnant you''re breastfeeding In many cases, it''s unlikely a vaccine given while pregnant or breastfeeding will cause problems for the baby. However, your GP will be able to give you further advice about this. People with immune deficiencies For some people travelling overseas, vaccination against certain diseases may not be advised. This may be the case if: you have a condition that affects your body''s immune system, such as HIV or AIDS you''re receiving treatment that affects your immune system, such as chemotherapy you''ve recently had a bone marrow or organ transplant Your GP can give you further advice about this. Non-travel vaccines As well as getting any travel vaccinations you need, it''s also a good opportunity to make sure your other vaccinations are up-to-date and have booster jabs if necessary. Your GP surgery can check your existing vaccination records. People in certain risk groups may be offered extra vaccines. These include vaccinations against diseases such as hepatitis B, tuberculosis (TB), flu and chickenpox.

These categories are: inattentiveness hyperactivity and impulsiveness Most people with ADHD have problems that fall into both these categories, but this isn''t always the case. For example, some people with the condition may have problems with inattentiveness, but not with hyperactivity or impulsiveness. This form of ADHD is also known as attention deficit disorder (ADD). ADD can sometimes go unnoticed because the symptoms may be less obvious. Symptoms in children and teenagers The symptoms of ADHD in children and teenagers are well defined, and they''re usually noticeable before the age of six. They occur in more than one situation, such as at home and at school. The main signs of each behavioural problem are detailed below. Inattentiveness The main signs of inattentiveness are: having a short attention span and being easily distracted making careless mistakes – for example, in schoolwork appearing forgetful or losing things being unable to stick at tasks that are tedious or time-consuming appearing to be unable to listen to or carry out instructions constantly changing activity or task having difficulty organising tasks Hyperactivity and impulsiveness The main signs of hyperactivity and impulsiveness are: being unable to sit still, especially in calm or quiet surroundings constantly fidgeting being unable to concentrate on tasks excessive physical movement excessive talking being unable to wait their turn acting without thinking interrupting conversations little or no sense of danger These symptoms can cause significant problems in a child''s life, such as underachievement at school, poor social interaction with other children and adults, and problems with discipline. Related conditions in children and teenagers Although not always the case, some children may also have signs of other problems or conditions alongside ADHD, such as: anxiety disorder – which causes your child to worry and be nervous much of the time; it may also cause physical symptoms, such as a rapid heartbeat, sweating and dizziness oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) – this is defined by negative and disruptive behaviour, particularly towards authority figures, such as parents and teachers conduct disorder – this often involves a tendency towards highly antisocial behaviour, such as stealing, fighting, vandalism and harming people or animals depression sleep problems – finding it difficult to get to sleep at night, and having irregular sleeping patterns autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) – this affects social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour epilepsy – a condition that affects the brain and causes repeated fits or seizures Tourette’s syndrome – a condition of the nervous system, characterised by a combination of involuntary noises and movements called tics learning difficulties – such as dyslexia Symptoms in adults In adults, the symptoms of ADHD are more difficult to define. This is largely due to a lack of research into adults with ADHD. ADHD is a developmental disorder; it''s believed that it can''t develop in adults without it first appearing during childhood. But it''s known that symptoms of ADHD often persist from childhood into a person''s teenage years, and then adulthood. Any additional problems or conditions experienced by children with ADHD, such as depression or dyslexia, may also continue into adulthood. By the age of 25, an estimated 15% of people diagnosed with ADHD as children still have a full range of symptoms, and 65% still have some symptoms that affect their daily lives. The symptoms in children and teenagers, which are listed above, is sometimes also applied to adults with possible ADHD. But some specialists say that the way in which inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness affect adults can be very different from the way they affect children. For example, hyperactivity tends to decrease in adults, while inattentiveness tends to get worse as the pressure of adult life increases. Adult symptoms of ADHD also tend to be far more subtle than childhood symptoms. Some specialists have suggested the following list of symptoms associated with ADHD in adults: carelessness and lack of attention to detail continually starting new tasks before finishing old ones poor organisational skills inability to focus or prioritise continually losing or misplacing things forgetfulness restlessness and edginess difficulty keeping quiet and speaking out of turn blurting out responses and often interrupting others mood swings, irritability and a quick temper inability to deal with stress extreme impatience taking risks in activities, often with little or no regard for personal safety or the safety of others – for example, driving dangerously Additional problems in adults with ADHD As with ADHD in children and teenagers, ADHD in adults can occur alongside several related problems or conditions. One of the most common conditions is depression. Other conditions that adults may have alongside ADHD include: personality disorders – conditions in which an individual differs significantly from an average person, in terms of how they think, perceive, feel or relate to others bipolar disorder – a condition that affects your moods, which can swing from one extreme to another obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) – a condition that causes obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviour The behavioural problems associated with ADHD can also cause problems such as difficulties with relationships, social interaction, drugs and crime. Some adults with ADHD find it hard to find and stay in a job. Community content from HealthUnlocked Page last reviewed: 25/04/2016 Next review due: 01/04/2019', 1745981764),

Vaccination is usually only recommended for travellers to areas where cholera is widespread, particularly for aid workers and people who are likely to have limited access to medical services. The cholera vaccine is usually available on the NHS, but this can vary. It''s also available through private prescription from a private travel clinic. The vaccine The cholera vaccine is given as a drink, where the vaccination ingredients are mixed with water. You should avoid eating, drinking or taking oral medication for an hour before and after having the vaccination. For adults and children over the age of six, two doses of the vaccine are needed to protect against cholera for two years. After this, a booster is required if you continue to be at risk. Children who are two to six years of age will need to have three doses of the vaccine. This will protect them for six months. After this, they will need to have a booster if they continue to be at risk. All the doses must be taken one to six weeks apart. If more than six weeks passes between doses, you''ll need to start the full vaccination course again. Ideally, the vaccination course should be completed at least one week before travelling. The cholera vaccine isn''t recommended for children under two years of age, because it''s not clear how well it works in this age group. Side effects and precautions After having the cholera vaccine, less than 1 in 100 people will experience short-term symptoms similar to a mild stomach upset, such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea. Severe reactions are very rare. Most people can have the vaccination safely, but you should tell the doctor or nurse before being vaccinated if you: have a high temperature (fever) or stomach upset are pregnant or think you might be pregnant are breastfeeding have a condition, or are receiving treatment, that affects your immune system In these circumstances, you may still be able to have the vaccine if you''re at a high risk of getting cholera, but your doctor or nurse may need to check with a travel medicine specialist before giving it to you. The vaccination may need to be delayed if you''re unwell with a fever or upset stomach. You shouldn''t have the vaccine if you''ve had an allergic reaction to the cholera vaccine or any of the vaccine components in the past. Reporting side effects The Yellow Card Scheme allows you to report suspected side effects from any type of medicine you''re taking. It''s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Page last reviewed: 18/12/2015 Next review due: 30/04/2018', -1098972953),

ADHD can be treated using medication or therapy, but a combination of both is often best. Treatment is usually arranged by a specialist, such as a paediatrician or psychiatrist, although the condition may be monitored by your GP.  Medication There are five types of medication licensed for the treatment of ADHD: methylphenidate  dexamfetamine lisdexamfetamine atomoxetine guanfacine These medications aren''t a permanent cure for ADHD, but may help someone with the condition concentrate better, be less impulsive, feel calmer, and learn and practise new skills. Some medications need to be taken every day, but some can be taken just on school days. Treatment breaks are occasionally recommended, to assess whether the medication is still needed. In the UK, all of these medications are licensed for use in children and teenagers. Atomoxetine is also licensed for use in adults who had symptoms of ADHD as children. If you weren''t diagnosed with ADHD until adulthood, your GP and specialist can discuss which medications and therapies are suitable for you. If you or your child is prescribed one of these medications, you''ll probably be given small doses at first, which may then be gradually increased. You or your child will need to see your GP for regular check-ups, to ensure the treatment is working effectively and to check for signs of any side effects or problems. Your specialist will discuss how long you should take your treatment but, in many cases, treatment is continued for as long as it is helping. Methylphenidate Methylphenidate is the most commonly used medication for ADHD. It belongs to a group of medicines called stimulants that work by increasing activity in the brain, particularly in areas that play a part in controlling attention and behaviour. Methylphenidate can be used by teenagers and children with ADHD over the age of six. Although methylphenidate isn''t licensed for use in adults, it may be taken under close supervision from your GP and specialist. The medication can be taken as either immediate-release tablets (small doses taken two to three times a day), or as modified-release tablets (taken once a day in the morning, and they release the dose throughout the day). Common side effects of methylphenidate include: a small increase in blood pressure and heart rate loss of appetite, which can lead to weight loss or poor weight gain trouble sleeping headaches stomach aches mood swings Dexamfetamine Dexamfetamine is also a stimulant medication, which works in a similar way to methylphenidate by stimulating areas of the brain that play a part in controlling attention and behaviour. Dexamfetamine can be used by teenagers and children with ADHD over the age of three. Although it''s not licensed for use in adults, it may be taken under close supervision from your GP and specialist. Dexamfetamine is usually taken as a tablet once or twice a day, although an oral solution is also available. Common side effects of dexamfetamine include: decreased appetite mood swings agitation and aggression dizziness headaches diarrhoea nausea and vomiting Lisdexamfetamine Lisdexamfetamine is a similar medication to dexamfetamine, and works in the same way. It can be used by children with ADHD over the age of six if treatment with methylphenidate hasn''t helped. You may continue to take it into adulthood if your doctor thinks you''re benefitting from treatment. Lisdexamfetamine comes in capsule form, which you or your child usually take once a day. Common side effects of lisdexamfetamine include: decreased appetite, which can lead to weight loss or poor weight gain aggression drowsiness dizziness headaches diarrhoea nausea and vomiting Atomoxetine Atomoxetine works differently to other ADHD medications. It''s known as a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which means it increases the amount of a chemical in the brain called noradrenaline. This chemical passes messages between brain cells, and increasing the amount can aid concentration and help control impulses. Atomoxetine can be used by teenagers and children over the age of six. It''s also licensed for use in adults if symptoms of ADHD are confirmed. Atomoxetine comes in capsule form, which you or your child usually take once or twice a day. Common side effects of atomoxetine include: a small increase in blood pressure and heart rate nausea and vomiting stomach aches trouble sleeping dizziness headaches irritability Atomoxetine has also been linked to some more serious side effects that it''s important to look out for, including suicidal thoughts and liver damage. If either you or your child begin to feel depressed or suicidal while taking this medication, speak to your doctor. Guanfacine Guanfacine acts on part of the brain to improve attention and it also reduces blood pressure. It''s used for ADHD in teenagers and children if other medicines are unsuitable or ineffective. Guanfacine is usually taken as a tablet once a day, in the morning or evening. Common side effects include: tiredness or fatigue headache abdominal pain dry mouth Therapy As well as taking medication, different therapies can be useful in treating ADHD in children, teenagers and adults. Therapy is also effective in treating additional problems, such as conduct or anxiety disorders, that may appear with ADHD. Some of the therapies that may be used are outlined below. Psychoeducation Psychoeducation means that you or your child will be encouraged to discuss ADHD and how it affects you. It can help children, teenagers and adults make sense of being diagnosed with ADHD, and can help you to cope and live with the condition. Behaviour therapy Behaviour therapy provides support for carers of children with ADHD, and may involve teachers as well as parents. Behaviour therapy usually involves behaviour management, which uses a system of rewards to encourage your child to try to control their ADHD. If your child has ADHD, you can identify types of behaviour you want to encourage, such as sitting at the table to eat. Your child is then given some sort of small reward for good behaviour, and removal of a privilege for poor behaviour. For teachers, behaviour management involves learning how to plan and structure activities, and to praise and encourage children for even very small amounts of progress. Parent training and education programmes If your child has ADHD, specially tailored parent training and education programmes can help you learn specific ways of talking to your child, and playing and working with them to improve their attention and behaviour. You may also be offered parent training before your child is formally diagnosed with ADHD. These programmes are usually arranged in groups of around 10-12 parents. A programme usually consists of 10-16 meetings, which each last up to two hours. They aim to teach parents and carers about behaviour management (see above), while increasing confidence in your ability to help your child and improve your relationship.  Social skills training Social skills training involves your child taking part in role play situations, and aims to teach them how to behave in social situations by learning how their behaviour affects others. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave. A CBT therapist would try to change how your child feels about a situation, which would in turn potentially change their behaviour. CBT can be carried out with a therapist individually or in a group. Other possible treatments There are other ways of treating ADHD that some people with the condition find helpful, such as cutting out certain foods and taking supplements. However, there''s no strong evidence these work, and they shouldn''t be attempted without medical advice. Diet People with ADHD should eat a healthy, balanced diet. Don''t cut out foods before seeking medical advice. Some people may notice a link between types of food and worsening ADHD symptoms. For example, sugar, food colourings and additives, and caffeine are often blamed for aggravating hyperactivity, and some people believe they have intolerances to wheat or dairy products, which may add to their symptoms. If this is the case, keep a diary of what you eat and drink, and what behaviour this causes. Discuss this with your GP, who may refer you to a dietitian (a healthcare professional who specialises in nutrition). Supplements Some studies have suggested that supplements of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids may be beneficial in people with ADHD, although the evidence supporting this is very limited. It''s advisable to talk to your GP before using any supplements, because some can react unpredictably with medication or make it less effective. You should also remember that some supplements shouldn''t be taken long term, as they can reach dangerous levels in your body. Tips for parents Be sure that your GP or specialist helps you understand the difference between ADHD and other problems your child may have. Think about who else needs to know about your child’s ADHD, such as their school or nursery. Find out the side effects of any medication your child takes and what you need to look out for. Getting to know people at local support groups can stop you feeling isolated and unable to cope.   For information on local support groups, contact Attention Deficit Disorder Information and Support Service (ADDISS) or call 020 8952 2800.   Read more about living with ADHD.

High-risk areas Typhoid is found throughout the world, but it''s more likely to occur in areas where there''s poor sanitation and hygiene. High-risk areas include: the Indian subcontinent Africa South and South East Asia South America the Middle East Europe Central America Vaccination is strongly recommended if you''re going to be staying or working with local people, or if you''re going to be staying for prolonged periods in areas where sanitation and food hygiene are likely to be poor. In the UK, most people who get typhoid fever develop it while visiting India, Pakistan or Bangladesh. It''s therefore particularly important that you''re vaccinated if you''re visiting these countries. Vaccination against typhoid fever is usually free on the NHS from GP surgeries. Private travel clinics also offer the vaccine for about £30. Choosing a typhoid vaccine In the UK, the two main vaccines available to prevent typhoid fever are: Vi vaccine – given as a single injection Ty21a vaccine – given as three capsules to take on alternate days Combined typhoid and hepatitis A injections are also available for people aged 15 or older. Protection against hepatitis A lasts one year and protection against typhoid lasts three years. The vaccines work by stimulating your body to create antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) that prevent you getting ill if you become infected with the typhoid bacteria. It''s important to remember that none of the typhoid vaccines are 100% effective, and you should always take precautions when eating food and drinking water abroad (see the advice below about this). The Vi vaccine is generally more effective than the Ty21a vaccine, but some people prefer to have the Ty21a vaccine because it doesn''t require an injection. As the Ty21a vaccine contains a live sample of Salmonella typhi bacteria, it isn''t suitable for people with a weakened immune system, such as people with HIV or those receiving certain types of treatment, such as chemotherapy. It also isn''t usually recommended for children under six, whereas children can have the Vi vaccine from two years of age. The typhoid vaccine should ideally be given at least one month before you travel, although if necessary it can be given closer to your travel date. Booster vaccinations are recommended every three years if you continue to be at risk of infection with typhoid bacteria. Side effects of typhoid fever vaccine After having the typhoid fever vaccine, some people have temporary soreness, redness, swelling or hardness at the injection site. About 1 in every 100 people experience a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above. Less common side effects include: abdominal pain headache feeling sick diarrhoea Severe reactions are rare for both typhoid vaccines. Read more about routine NHS vaccinations. Advice for travellers Whether you''ve been vaccinated against typhoid or not, it''s important to take basic precautions when travelling in countries where typhoid fever is present. For example: only drink bottled water from a bottle that was properly sealed, or water that''s been recently boiled  avoid ice cream and don''t have ice in your drinks avoid uncooked fruits and vegetables, unless you''ve washed them in safe water or peeled them yourself avoid shellfish, seafood or salads Read more about food and water abroad.

If you''re worried about your child, it may help to speak to their teachers before seeing your GP, to find out if they have any concerns about your child''s behaviour. Your GP can''t formally diagnose ADHD, but they can discuss your concerns with you and refer you for a specialist assessment, if necessary. When you see your GP, they may ask you: about your symptoms or those of your child when these symptoms started where the symptoms occur – for example, at home or in school whether the symptoms affect your or your child’s day-to-day life – for example, if they make socialising difficult if there have been any recent significant events in your life or your child''s, such as a death or divorce in the family if there''s a family history of ADHD about any other problems or symptoms of different health conditions you or your child may have Next steps If your GP thinks your child may have ADHD, they may first suggest a period of "watchful waiting" lasting around 10 weeks – to see if your child''s symptoms improve, stay the same or get worse. They may also suggest starting a parent training or education programme to teach you ways of helping your child (see treating ADHD for more information). If your child''s behaviour doesn''t improve, and both you and your GP believe it''s seriously affecting their day-to-day life, your GP should refer you and your child to a specialist for a formal assessment (see below). For adults with possible ADHD, your GP will assess your symptoms and may refer you for an assessment if: you weren''t diagnosed with ADHD as a child, but your symptoms began during childhood and have been ongoing since then your symptoms can''t be explained by a mental health condition your symptoms have a significant impact on your day-to-day life – for example, if you''re underachieving at work or find intimate relationships difficult You may also be referred to a specialist if you had ADHD as a child or young person, and your symptoms are now causing moderate or severe functional impairment. Assessment There are a number of different specialists that you or your child may be referred to for a formal assessment, including: a child or adult psychiatrist a paediatrician (a specialist in children''s health) a learning disability specialist, social worker or occupational therapist with expertise in ADHD Who you''re referred to depends on your age and what''s available in your local area. There''s no simple test to determine whether you or your child have ADHD, but your specialist can make an accurate diagnosis after a detailed assessment that may include: a physical examination, which can help rule out other possible causes for the symptoms a series of interviews with you or your child interviews or reports from other significant people, such as partners, parents and teachers The criteria for making a diagnosis of ADHD in children, teenagers and adults are outlined below. Diagnosis in children and teenagers Diagnosing ADHD in children depends on a set of strict criteria. To be diagnosed with ADHD, your child must have six or more symptoms of inattentiveness, or six or more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Read more about the symptoms of ADHD. To be diagnosed with ADHD, your child must also have: been displaying symptoms continuously for at least six months started to show symptoms before the age of 12 been showing symptoms in at least two different settings – for example, at home and at school, to rule out the possibility that the behaviour is just a reaction to certain teachers or parental control symptoms that make their lives considerably more difficult on a social, academic or occupational level symptoms that aren''t just part of a developmental disorder or difficult phase, and aren''t better accounted for by another condition Diagnosis in adults Diagnosing ADHD in adults is more difficult because there''s some disagreement about whether the list of symptoms used to diagnose children and teenagers also applies to adults. In some cases, an adult may be diagnosed with ADHD if they have five or more symptoms of inattentiveness, or five or more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness, that are listed in diagnostic criteria for children with ADHD. As part of your assessment, the specialist will ask about your present symptoms. However, under current diagnostic guidelines, a diagnosis of ADHD in adults can''t be confirmed unless your symptoms have been present from childhood. If you find it difficult to remember whether you had problems as a child, or you weren''t diagnosed with ADHD when you were younger, your specialist may wish to see your old school records or talk to your parents, teachers or anyone else who knew you well when you were a child. For an adult to be diagnosed with ADHD, their symptoms should also have a moderate impact on different areas of their life, such as: underachieving at work or in education driving dangerously difficultly making or keeping friends difficulty in relationships with partners If your problems are recent and didn''t occur regularly in the past, you''re not considered to have ADHD. This is because it''s currently not thought that ADHD can develop for the first time in adults.

These colours include: sunset yellow (E110)  quinoline yellow (E104) carmoisine (E122) allura red (E129) tartrazine (E102) ponceau 4R (E124) These colours are used in a number of foods, including soft drinks, sweets, cakes and ice cream. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has published a list of manufacturers with food ranges free from the six colours. What are E numbers? All food additives, whether natural or artificial, must go through a rigorous safety assessment and approval procedure, and must comply with European Union (EU) legislation. They''re only allowed to be used if experts decide they''re necessary and safe. If a food additive has an E number, this shows it''s passed safety tests and has been approved for use throughout the EU. If colours are used in food they must be declared in the list of ingredients as ''colour'', with either their name or E number. If any of the six colours listed above are in food or drink, the food label must also have a specific warning saying that the colour ''may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children''. You can avoid certain additives by checking the label. If you buy foods without packaging, you''ll need to check with the manufacturer or the person selling the product. The advice about food additives and hyperactivity was issued after being evaluated by the independent Committee on Toxicity and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) following research commissioned by the FSA. The FSA is encouraging manufacturers to work towards finding alternatives to these food colours. Some manufacturers and retailers have already taken action to remove them. The FSA website has more information about where to find products free from the colours associated with hyperactivity. You should also be aware that certain additives, such as sulphites, can cause allergic reactions. Read more about the causes of food allergy. The difference between hyperactivity and ADHD In the context of this advice, hyperactivity is when a child is overactive, can''t concentrate and acts on sudden impulses without thinking about alternatives. Experts think hyperactivity affects 2-5% of children in the UK. There''s no single test for diagnosing it. It''s important to remember that hyperactivity is also associated with factors other than additives, including premature birth, genetics and upbringing. ADHD is more than just hyperactive behaviour. It''s linked to a specific pattern of behaviour, including reduced attention span and difficulty concentrating, to the extent that the child’s ability to learn and function at home and school is affected. Children with ADHD often have learning difficulties and behavioural problems.   Page last reviewed: 18/02/2015 Next review due: 18/02/2017', 310608494),

Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most common causes of sight loss among people of working age. It occurs when diabetes affects small blood vessels, damaging the part of the eye called the retina. When the blood vessels in the central area of the retina (the macula) are affected, it''s known as diabetic maculopathy. People with diabetes should also see their optician every two years for a regular eye test. Diabetic eye screening is specifically for diabetic retinopathy and can''t be relied upon for other conditions. This page covers: Why it''s needed When it''s offered Eye screening in pregnancy What happens during screening Results Private screening Why eye screening is needed Screening is a way of detecting the condition early before you notice any changes to your vision. Diabetic retinopathy doesn''t usually cause any noticeable symptoms in the early stages. If retinopathy is detected early enough, treatment can stop it getting worse. Otherwise, by the time symptoms become noticeable, it can be much more difficult to treat. This is why the NHS Diabetic Eye Screening Programme was introduced. Everyone aged 12 and over with diabetes is offered screening once a year. Diabetic retinopathy is extremely unusual in children with diabetes who are under the age of 12.  The check takes about half an hour and involves examining the back of the eyes and taking photographs of the retina. When diabetic eye screening is offered Everyone with diabetes who is 12 years of age or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year. You should receive a letter from your local Diabetic Eye Screening Service inviting you to attend a screening appointment. The letter will include a leaflet about diabetic eye screening. People with diabetes can opt out of the screening programme if they choose. They should confirm this decision in writing to the screening service that has invited them for diabetic eye screening Contact your local screening service or your GP if you haven''t received a letter and your appointment is overdue. You can look up your local screening service here – your service will be the one nearest to your GP surgery. The invitation will say where you need to go. This may be your GP surgery, your local hospital, a local optician''s practice, or another nearby clinic. Bring all the glasses and contact lenses you wear, along with lens solution for contacts. If you have sight problems in between screening appointments, such as sudden vision loss or a deterioration in your vision, seek immediate medical advice. Don''t wait until your next screening appointment. Diabetic eye screening in pregnancy If you have diabetes and become pregnant, you''ll need special care as there are risks to both mother and baby associated with the condition. You''ll be offered additional tests for diabetic retinopathy at or soon after your first antenatal clinic visit, and also after 28 weeks of pregnancy. If the early stages of retinopathy are found at the first screening, you''ll also be offered another test between 16 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. If serious retinopathy is found at any screening, you''ll be referred to an eye specialist. Some women who don''t have diabetes can develop hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) during pregnancy. This is known as gestational diabetes. Pregnant women who develop gestational diabetes aren''t offered screening for diabetic retinopathy. What happens during diabetic eye screening The screening appointment should last about 30 minutes. When you arrive, the procedure will be explained to you. If you have any questions, ask the healthcare professional who is treating you. You''ll be given eye drops to enlarge your pupils, which takes between 15 and 20 minutes, and photographs of your retina will be taken.   There will be a flash of light each time a photograph is taken, but the camera won''t touch your eye. Although the light is bright, it shouldn''t be uncomfortable. The eye drops may cause your eyes to sting slightly, and after about 15 minutes your vision will be blurred. You may find it difficult to focus on objects that are close to you. Depending on the type of eye drops used, the blurring can last between two and six hours. You won''t be able to drive home from your appointment, so you may want to bring someone with you. After the screening procedure, you may also find that everything looks very bright. You may want to take a pair of sunglasses to wear afterwards. Side effects In very rare cases, the eye drops can cause a sudden pressure increase within the eye. This requires prompt treatment at an eye unit. The symptoms of a pressure increase are: pain or severe discomfort in your eye redness of the white of your eye constantly blurred vision, sometimes with rainbow halos around lights If you experience any of these symptoms after screening, go back to the screening centre or your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Your screening results Within six weeks, both you and your GP should receive a letter letting you know your results. You won''t get the results immediately as the photographs need to be studied by a number of different healthcare professionals, including someone who is trained in identifying and grading retinopathy. The screening results may show either: no retinopathy background retinopathy – also called stage one retinopathy degrees of referable retinopathy – this means retinopathy that requires referral to an eye specialist for further assessment and treatment You may need to have a further assessment if: the photographs aren''t clear enough to give an accurate result you have retinopathy that could affect your sight and follow-up treatment is needed you have retinopathy that needs to be checked more than once a year other eye conditions are detected, such as glaucoma (a group of eye conditions that affect vision) or cataracts (cloudy patches in the lens of the eye) If your results show no retinopathy or background retinopathy, you''ll be invited back for another screening appointment a year later. You can also reduce your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy in the future by controlling your blood sugar levels and blood pressure. Read more about preventing diabetic retinopathy. If screening detects signs that diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy is threatening your sight, you''ll be given information about how far the condition has progressed. This will determine the type of treatment you receive. Read about the treatment options for diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy. If you have questions about your results, contact your local diabetic eye screening service. Their details should be on the letter you received from them. Alternatively, you can find your local screening service here. Private screening for diabetic retinopathy Eye checks for diabetic retinopathy are available privately but they won''t necessarily be quality-assured in the same way as the NHS Diabetic Eye Screening Programme. If you''re considering private screening, check that the company is properly regulated and ask for clear written information about the benefits as well as the risks of any tests offered. Find further information in the UK National Screening Committee''s leaflet on private screening. Diabetic retinopathy screening Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video. Diabetic retinopathy causes changes in the eye. Often those changes can be treated if they are picked up early. This video explains what happens when you go for diabetic eye screening.

Vaccinations are available to protect you against infections such as yellow fever, typhoid and hepatitis A. In the UK, the childhood vaccination programme protects you against a number of diseases, but doesn''t cover most of the infectious diseases found overseas. Which jabs do I need? You can find out which vaccinations are necessary or recommended for the areas you''ll be visiting on these two websites: NHS fitfortravel the National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) Some countries require you to have an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP) before you enter. For example, Saudi Arabia requires proof of vaccination against certain types of meningitis for visitors arriving for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. Many tropical countries in Africa and South America won''t accept travellers from an area where there''s yellow fever unless they can prove they''ve been vaccinated against it. Read more about the vaccines available for travellers abroad. Where do I get my jabs? You should get advice at least eight weeks before you''re due to travel, as some jabs need to be given well in advance. First, phone or visit your GP or practice nurse to find out whether your existing UK jabs are up-to-date (they can tell from your notes). Your GP or practice nurse may also be able to give you general advice about travel vaccinations and travel health, such as protecting yourself from malaria. Your GP or practice nurse can give you a booster of your UK jabs if you need one. They may be able to give you the travel jabs you need, either free on the NHS or for a charge. Alternatively, you can visit a local private travel vaccination clinic for your UK boosters and other travel jabs. Not all vaccinations are available free on the NHS, even if they''re recommended for travel to a certain area. Free travel vaccinations The following travel vaccinations are usually available free on the NHS: diphtheria, polio and tetanus (combined booster) typhoid hepatitis A – including when combined with typhoid or hepatitis B cholera These vaccines are usually free because they protect against diseases thought to represent the greatest risk to public health if they were brought into the country. Private travel vaccinations You''re likely to have to pay for travel vaccinations against: hepatitis B when not combined with hepatitis A Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis meningitis vaccines  rabies tuberculosis (TB) yellow fever Yellow fever vaccines are only available from designated centres. The NaTHNaC website can help you find a clinic offering yellow fever vaccination. The cost of travel vaccines at private clinics will vary, but could be around £50 for each dose of a vaccine. It''s worth considering this when budgeting for your trip. Things to consider There are several things to consider when planning your travel vaccinations, including: the country or countries you''re visiting – some diseases are more common in certain parts of the world and less common in others  when you''re travelling – some diseases are more common at certain times of the year; for example, during the rainy season where you''re staying – in general, you''ll be more at risk of disease in rural areas than in urban areas, and if you''re backpacking and staying in hostels or camping, you may be more at risk than if you were on a package holiday and staying in a hotel how long you''ll be staying – the longer your stay, the greater your risk of being exposed to diseases your age and health – some people may be more vulnerable to infection than others, while some vaccinations can''t be given to people with certain medical conditions what you''ll be doing during your stay – for example, whether you''ll be spending a lot of time outdoors, such as trekking or working in rural areas if you''re working as an aid worker – you may come into contact with more diseases if you''re working in a refugee camp or helping after a natural disaster if you''re working in a medical setting – for example, a doctor or nurse may require additional vaccinations if you are in contact with animals – in this case, you may be more at risk of getting diseases spread by animals, such as rabies If you''re only travelling to countries in northern and central Europe, North America or Australia, you''re unlikely to need any vaccinations. If possible, see your GP at least eight weeks before you''re due to travel. Some vaccinations need to be given well in advance to allow your body to develop immunity. Some also involve multiple doses spread over several weeks. Pregnancy and breastfeeding Speak to your GP before having any vaccinations if: you''re pregnant you think you might be pregnant you''re breastfeeding In many cases, it''s unlikely a vaccine given while pregnant or breastfeeding will cause problems for the baby. However, your GP will be able to give you further advice about this. People with immune deficiencies For some people travelling overseas, vaccination against certain diseases may not be advised. This may be the case if: you have a condition that affects your body''s immune system, such as HIV or AIDS you''re receiving treatment that affects your immune system, such as chemotherapy you''ve recently had a bone marrow or organ transplant Your GP can give you further advice about this. Non-travel vaccines As well as getting any travel vaccinations you need, it''s also a good opportunity to make sure your other vaccinations are up-to-date and have booster jabs if necessary. Your GP surgery can check your existing vaccination records. People in certain risk groups may be offered extra vaccines. These include vaccinations against diseases such as hepatitis B, tuberculosis (TB), flu and chickenpox.

Who should have the hepatitis A vaccine People usually advised to have the hepatitis A vaccine include: close contacts of someone with hepatitis A people planning to travel to or live in parts of the world where hepatitis A is widespread, particularly if levels of sanitation and food hygiene are expected to be poor people with any type of long-term (chronic) liver disease men who have sex with other men people who inject illegal drugs people who may be exposed to hepatitis A through their job – this includes sewage workers, staff of institutions where levels of personal hygiene may be poor (such as a homeless shelter) and people working with monkeys, apes and gorillas Contact your GP surgery if you think you should have the hepatitis A vaccine or you''re not sure whether you need it. Types of hepatitis A vaccine There are three main types of hepatitis A vaccination: a vaccine for hepatitis A only a combined vaccine for hepatitis A and hepatitis B a combined vaccine for hepatitis A and typhoid fever Talk to your GP about which vaccine is most suitable for you. All three types are usually available for free on the NHS. If you''ve travelling abroad, try to plan your vaccinations in advance. They should ideally be started at least two or three weeks before you leave, although some can be given up to the day of your departure if necessary. Extra doses of the vaccine are often recommended after 6-12 months if you need long-term protection. You can find more information about the various hepatitis A vaccines on the NHS Fit for Travel website. Side effects of the hepatitis A vaccine Some people develop temporary soreness, redness and hardening of the skin at the injection site after having the hepatitis A vaccine. A small, painless lump may also form, but this usually disappears quickly and isn''t a cause for concern.

Someone with a dissociative disorder may have memory loss or may feel: that their body or the world around them is unreal uncertain about who they are that they have many different identities Most people affected by this disorder will have experienced a traumatic event during childhood. They ''dissociate'', or switch off from reality, to cope with it (the box on this page explains what ''dissociation'' means). This feeling of being disconnected from yourself or from the world can be extremely distressing, significantly affecting work and personal life. It can affect people at any age and is nothing to do with a head injury or underlying health condition – it''s the result of the brain adapting to a difficult early life. If you have been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder, or a friend or family member has, read on. This page explains three main types of dissociative disorders: dissociative amnesia depersonalisation-derealisation disorder  dissociative identity disorder It then explains what we know about the cause of dissociative disorders, other conditions commonly associated with dissociative disorders, and how dissociative disorders are treated. What is dissociative amnesia? Someone with dissociative amnesia will repeatedly have periods where they cannot remember information about themselves or about events in their past life. They may also forget a learnt talent or skill. These gaps in memory are much more severe than normal forgetfulness, and are not the result of an underlying medical condition. Some people with dissociative amnesia will find themselves in a strange place without knowing how they got there. They may have travelled there purposefully, or wandered in a confused state. These blank episodes may last minutes, hours or days – and rarely, months or years. What is depersonalisation-derealisation disorder? ''Depersonalisation'' means feeling detached from yourself, observing yourself and your feelings and thoughts as if they belong to someone else you are watching in a movie. Some of the typical symptoms are: out-of-body experiences loss of feeling in parts of your body distorted views of your body unable to recognise your image in a mirror a sense of detachment from your emotions feeling like you are watching a movie of yourself feeling like you are unreal ''Derealisation'' means seeing other people and the environment around you as dream-like and unreal. Objects may change in shape, size or colour. Typical symptoms are: feeling like a normal environment is unfamiliar a sense that what is happening is unreal feeling detached from the world a perception of objects changing shape, colour, size feeling that people you know are strangers You might experience one or both of these problems if you have been diagnosed with depersonalisation-derealisation disorder, and will probably be aware that these experiences aren''t reality. Episodes of depersonalisation or derealisation may last just a few moments and come and go over many years, or may be ongoing. What is dissociative identity disorder? Dissociative identity disorder, or ''multiple personality disorder'', is the most extreme of the three types. If you''ve been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, you may feel uncertain about who you are and struggle to define yourself. You may feel the presence of other identities, which may each have their own names, voices, personal histories and mannerisms. Typical symptoms are: feeling like a stranger to yourself being confused about your sexuality or gender feeling like there are different people within you referring to yourself as ''we'' behaving out of character writing in different handwriting What''s the cause? Many people with a dissociative disorder will have experienced a traumatic event in the past. Often, this traumatic event will have been physical, sexual or emotional abuse suffered during childhood, although some people ''dissociate'' after experiencing war, kidnapping or even an invasive medical procedure. Switching off from reality is a normal defence mechanism that helps the person to cope during a traumatic time – it''s a form of denial, as if "this isn''t happening to me". It becomes dysfunctional when the environment is no longer traumatic but the person still acts and lives as if it is, and hasn''t dealt with or processed the event. So, a dissociative disorder is the result of the brain adapting to a difficult early life environment. It is not: to do with genes the result of another medical condition the result of a head injury the result of drug or alcohol abuse (although many people with dissociative disorders misuse alcohol or drugs to cope) What are the some of the associated conditions? Someone with a dissociative disorder may also suffer from: post-traumatic stress disorder  depression  mood swings anxiety and panic attacks suicidal tendencies and/or self-harm headaches hearing voices  sleep disorders phobias  an eating disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder  How are dissociative disorders treated? If you have been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder, a mental health specialist will want to ask you more questions about how you are feeling and find out whether you suffered any trauma in the past. It''s important to be honest about your symptoms, and not feel ashamed or embarrassed, so you can receive the help and support you need. Some people with dissociative disorders will benefit from a course of psychotherapy or counselling. This talking therapy aims to help you cope with the underlying cause of your symptoms, and helps you to manage the periods of feeling disconnected. Read more about how psychotherapy works. If you have suffered a traumatic event in the past, you might benefit from a technique called eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). EMDR has been found to reduce the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. It involves making side-to-side eye movements, usually by following the movement of the therapist''s finger, while recalling the traumatic incident. It is not clear exactly how EMDR works, but it may help the malfunctioning part of the brain to process distressing memories and flashbacks so that they have less influence over your mind. Read more about EMDR. There is no medication to specifically treat dissociation, although medication may be prescribed to treat any depression, anxiety and insomnia. Read about the: treatment of depression treatment of anxiety treatment of insomnia Many people make a full recovery with treatment and support. If you''re feeling suicidal If you are reading this because you have, or have had, thoughts about taking your own life, it''s important you ask someone for help. It''s probably difficult for you to see it at this time, but you''re not alone and not beyond help.   There are people you can talk to who want to help: speak to a friend, family member or someone you trust as they may be able to help you calm down and find some breathing space call the Samaritans 24-hour support service on 08457 90 90 90 go to, or call, your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department and tell the staff how you are feeling contact NHS 111 make an urgent appointment to see your GP Read more about getting help if you''re feeling suicidal. If you are worried that someone you know may be considering suicide, try to encourage them to talk about how they are feeling. Listening is the best way to help. Try to avoid offering solutions and try not to judge.  If they have previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition, such as depression, you can speak to a member of their care team for help and advice. Read more about suicide warning signs and how you can help someone with suicidal thoughts. Support and further information You may find that reading about other people''s experiences of a dissociative disorder may help.

''Dissociation'' means a period when we feel disconnected from the environment and/or from ourselves. We all have these moments of disconnection from time to time – daydreaming while driving, or switching off and missing part of a conversation, for example. These moments of ''not being with it'' normally pass quickly. Someone with a dissociative disorder has persistent, repeated episodes of dissociation that are extreme enough to severely affect everyday life.

This affects the heart''s ability to pump blood around the body. Some types of cardiomyopathy are inherited and are seen in children and younger people. This page explains the main types of cardiomyopathy: dilated cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy takotsubo cardiomyopathy or ''broken heart syndrome'' It then explains:  diagnosing cardiomyopathy treating cardiomyopathy information about you Dilated cardiomyopathy In dilated cardiomyopathy the muscle walls of the heart have become stretched and thin, so they can''t contract (squeeze) properly to pump blood around the body. How serious is it? If you have dilated cardiomyopathy, you''re at greater risk of heart failure, where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure. Heart failure typically causes shortness of breath, extreme tiredness and ankle swelling. Learn more about the symptoms of heart failure. There''s also a risk of heart valve problems, an irregular heartbeat and blood clots. You''ll need to have regular appointments with your GP so the disease can be monitored. Who''s affected? Dilated cardiomyopathy can affect both children and adults.  The heart muscle can become stretched if you have an unhealthy lifestyle or an underlying medical condition, or both. The following can all play a role in the disease: uncontrolled high blood pressure an unhealthy lifestyle – such as a lack of vitamins and minerals in the diet, heavy drinking and recreational drug use a viral infection that causes inflammation of the heart muscle   a heart valve problem a disease of the body tissues or vessels – such as Wegener''s granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, lupus, polyarteritis nodosa, vasculitis or muscular dystrophy inheriting a mutated (changed) gene that makes you more vulnerable to the disease pregnancy – cardiomyopathy can sometimes develop as a complication of pregnancy But for many people, the cause is unknown. More information Read the British Heart Foundation''s detailed booklet on living with dilated cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle cells have enlarged and the walls of the heart chambers thicken. The chambers are reduced in size so they can''t hold much blood, and the walls can''t relax properly and may stiffen. How serious is it? Most people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will be able to live a full, normal life. Some people don''t even have symptoms and don''t need treatment. But that doesn''t mean the condition can''t be serious. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden unexpected death in childhood and in young athletes. The main heart chambers can become stiff, leading to back pressure on the smaller collecting chambers. This can sometimes worsen the symptoms of heart failure and lead to abnormal heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation). Blood flow from the heart may become reduced or restricted (known as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Also, the mitral heart valve can become leaky, causing blood to leak backwards. Read more about mitral regurgitation. These heart changes can cause dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath and temporary loss of consciousness. You''ll also be at greater risk of developing endocarditis (a heart infection). If you have severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, you''ll need to see your doctor regularly so your condition can be monitored. Your doctor will advise about the level and amount of exercise you can do and sensible lifestyle changes to make.  Who''s affected? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is thought to affect 1 in 500 people in the UK. Most people inherit the disease from their parents. Read more about how genetic conditions are inherited.   More information Read the British Heart Foundation''s detailed booklet on living with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy is rare and mostly affects older adults. The walls of the main heart chambers become stiffened and rigid and can''t relax properly after contracting. This means the heart can''t fill up properly with blood. It results in reduced blood flow from the heart and can lead to symptoms of heart failure, such as breathlessness, tiredness and ankle swelling, as well as heart rhythm problems. In many cases the cause is unknown, although sometimes it can be inherited. More information Read the American Heart Association''s leaflet on restrictive cardiomyopathy (PDF, 102kb). Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy In arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), the proteins that normally hold the heart muscle cells together are abnormal. Muscle cells can die and the dead muscle tissue is replaced with fatty and fibrous tissue. The walls of the main heart chambers become thin and stretched, and can''t pump blood around the body properly. People with ARVC typically have heart rhythm problems. Reduced blood flow from the heart can also lead to symptoms of heart failure. ARVC is an uncommon inherited condition caused by a mutation (change) in one or more genes. It can affect teenagers or young adults and has been the reason for some sudden unexplained deaths in young athletes. There''s increasing evidence that prolonged, strenuous exercise worsens the symptoms of ARVC. It''s important that people with or at risk of ARVC have a careful discussion about this with their cardiologist. More information Read the British Heart Foundation''s detailed booklet on ARVC. Diagnosing cardiomyopathy Some cases of cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed after various heart scans and tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram. Cardiomyopathy that runs in the family can be diagnosed after a genetic test. If you''ve been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, you may be advised to have a genetic test to identify the mutation (faulty gene) that caused this. Your relatives can then be tested for the same mutation and, if they have it, their condition can be monitored and managed early. Treating cardiomyopathy  There''s no cure for cardiomyopathy, but the treatments described below are usually effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications. Not everyone with cardiomyopathy will need treatment. Some people only have a mild form of the disease that they can control after making a few lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes If the cause of your cardiomyopathy isn''t genetic, it should generally help to: follow a healthy diet and take gentle exercise quit smoking (if you smoke) lose weight (if you''re overweight) avoid or reduce your intake of alcohol  get plenty of sleep manage stress make sure any underlying condition, such as diabetes, is well controlled  Medication Medication may be needed to control blood pressure, correct an abnormal heart rhythm, remove excess fluid or prevent blood clots.  Read about: medication for high blood pressure beta-blockers to treat an irregular heartbeat or heart failure diuretics to remove excess fluid from your body if this has caused swelling anticoagulants such as warfarin to prevent blood clots medication to treat heart failure Hospital procedures In some people with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the septum (the wall dividing the left and right side of the heart) is thickened and bulges into the main heart chamber. They may need to have either: an injection of alcohol into their heart – this is to reduce part of the muscle in the septum a septal myectomy – heart surgery to remove part of the thickened septum (the mitral valve may be repaired at the same time, if necessary) Those with heart rhythm problems may need to have a pacemaker, or a similar device, implanted to control their abnormal heart rhythm. Read more about having a pacemaker fitted. As a last resort, a heart transplant may be necessary. Information about you If you have cardiomyopathy, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. GOV.UK has more information about the register. Broken heart syndrome Some people who sustain significant emotional or physical stress, such as bereavement or major surgery, go on to experience a temporary heart problem. The heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or "stunned", causing the left ventricle (one of the heart''s main chambers) to change shape. It may be caused by a surge of hormones, particularly adrenaline, during this period of stress. The main symptoms are chest pain and breathlessness, similar to those of a heart attack – always call 999 if you or someone else experiences these. The condition – known medically as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or acute stress cardiomyopathy – is temporary and reversible. It''s unusual for it to happen again.

Problems can also occur because of changes in the way you digest food. Cancer Gastrectomies to treat stomach cancer have a higher risk of complications, because most people who have this type of surgery are elderly and often in poor health. Complications can also occur after a gastrectomy to treat oesophageal cancer. The oesophagus is the tube connecting your throat to your stomach. Possible complications of a gastrectomy include: wound infection leaking from where the stomach has been closed or reattached to the small intestine stricture – where stomach acid leaks up into your oesophagus and over time causes scarring, leading to the oesophagus becoming narrow and constricted chest infection internal bleeding blockage of the small intestine (small bowel) An infection can usually be treated with antibiotics, but some other complications will require further surgery. Before your operation, ask your surgeon to explain the possible risks and how likely they are to affect you. It''s estimated that around 2 in 100 people who have a gastrectomy for cancer die from complications. Obesity Possible complications of a gastrectomy for obesity include: nausea and vomiting – which usually get better over time internal bleeding – which can lead to blood clots forming leaking from where the stomach has been closed acid reflux – where stomach acid leaks back up into the oesophagus infection It may be possible to treat some complications with medication, but others may need further surgery. Before your operation, ask your surgeon to explain the possible risks and how likely they are to affect you. The risk of death from a gastrectomy for obesity is very low, estimated as less than 1 in 100. Vitamin deficiency One function of your stomach is to absorb vitamins, particularly vitamins B12, C and D, from the food you eat. If your entire stomach has been removed, you may not get all the vitamins your body needs from your diet. This may lead to certain health conditions, such as: Anaemia  The body requires vitamin B12 to make healthy blood cells. Without enough healthy blood cells, you could develop symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness and breathlessness. Increased vulnerability to infection Vitamin C helps to strengthen your immune system (the body''s natural defence against infection and illness). If you don''t have enough vitamin C in your diet, you may develop frequent infections. Wounds or burns will also take longer to heal. Brittle bones and weakened muscles Your body needs vitamin D to keep both your bones and muscles strong and healthy. If there isn''t enough vitamin D in your diet, you could develop pain and weakness in your bones (osteoporosis) and muscles. Changing your diet may help to compensate for your stomach''s inability to absorb vitamins. However, even after changing your diet, you may need vitamin supplements. The healthcare professionals treating you can advise on this. Read about recovering from a gastrectomy for more information on diet and supplements. Weight loss Immediately after surgery, you may find that eating even a small meal makes you feel uncomfortably full. This could lead to weight loss. Losing weight may be desirable if you''ve had a gastrectomy because you''re obese, but it can be a health risk if you''ve been treated for cancer. Some people who have a gastrectomy regain weight once they have adjusted to the effects of surgery and have changed their diet. However, if you continue to lose weight, see a dietitian (a healthcare professional who specialises in nutrition). A dietitian can give you advice on how to increase your weight without upsetting your digestive system. Dumping syndrome Dumping syndrome is a set of symptoms that can affect people after a gastrectomy. It''s caused when particularly sugary or starchy food moves suddenly into your small intestine. Before a gastrectomy, your stomach digested most of the sugar and starch. However, after surgery your stomach can no longer do this, so your small intestine has to draw in water from the rest of your body to help break down the food. The amount of water that enters your small intestine can be as much as 1.5 litres (3 pints). Much of the extra water is taken from your blood, which means you will experience a sudden fall in blood pressure. The drop in blood pressure can cause symptoms such as: faintness sweating palpitations a need to lie down The extra water in your small intestine will cause symptoms such as: bloating rumbling stomach nausea indigestion diarrhoea If you have dumping syndrome, resting for 20-45 minutes after eating a meal may help. To ease the symptoms of dumping syndrome: eat slowly avoid sugary foods – such as cakes, chocolate and sweets slowly add more fibre to your diet avoid soup and other liquid foods eat smaller, more frequent meals Seek advice from your hospital team or dietitian if you have symptoms of dumping syndrome. For most people, the symptoms improve over time. Morning vomiting After a partial gastrectomy, a small number of people may experience morning vomiting. Vomiting occurs when bile (a fluid used by the digestive system to break down fats) and digestive juices build up in your duodenum overnight, before spilling back into what remains of your stomach. The duodenum is the first part of your small intestine. Due to its reduced size, your stomach is likely to feel uncomfortably full and this will trigger a vomiting reflex to get rid of the excess fluids and bile. Taking indigestion medication, such as aluminium hydroxide, may help to reduce the symptoms of morning vomiting. See your GP if your symptoms are particularly troublesome. Diarrhoea During a gastrectomy, it''s sometimes necessary to cut a nerve called the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve helps to control the movement of food through your digestive system. Although the vagus nerve will heal after surgery, a small number of people will experience bouts of severe diarrhoea. However, they usually only occur now and again, and should pass within a day or so. Taking diarrhoea medication, such as loperamide, in the morning may help to reduce your symptoms.

Depression with psychosis is known as psychotic depression. Symptoms of severe depression Someone with severe clinical depression feels sad and hopeless for most of the day, practically every day, and has no interest in anything. Getting through the day feels almost impossible. Other typical symptoms of severe depression are: fatigue (exhaustion) loss of pleasure in things disturbed sleep changes in appetite feeling worthless and guilty being unable to concentrate or being indecisive thoughts of death or suicide Read more about the psychological, physical and social symptoms of clinical depression. Symptoms of psychosis Having moments of psychosis (psychotic episodes) means experiencing: delusions – thoughts or beliefs that are unlikely to be true  hallucinations – hearing and, in some cases, feeling, smelling, seeing or tasting things that aren''t there; hearing voices is a common hallucination The delusions and hallucinations almost always reflect the person''s deeply depressed mood – for example, they may become convinced they''re to blame for something, or that they''ve committed a crime. "Psychomotor agitation" is also common. This means not being able to relax or sit still, and constantly fidgeting. At the other extreme, a person with psychotic depression may have "psychomotor retardation", where both their thoughts and physical movements slow down. People with psychotic depression have an increased risk of thinking about suicide. What causes psychotic depression? The cause of psychotic depression isn''t fully understood. It''s known that there''s no single cause of depression and it has many different triggers. For some, stressful life events such as bereavement, divorce, serious illness or financial worries can be the cause. Genes probably play a part, as severe depression can run in families, although it''s not known why some people also develop psychosis. Many people with psychotic depression will have experienced adversity in childhood, such as a traumatic event. Read more about the causes of clinical depression. Treating psychotic depression Treatment for psychotic depression involves: medication – a combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants can help relieve the symptoms of psychosis psychological therapies – the one-to-one talking therapy cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has proved effective in helping some people with psychosis social support – support with social needs, such as education, employment or accommodation The person may need to stay in hospital for a short period of time while they''re receiving treatment. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may sometimes be recommended if the person has severe depression and other treatments, including antidepressants, haven''t worked. Treatment is usually effective, but follow-up appointments so that the person can be closely monitored are usually required. Getting help for others People with psychosis are often unaware that they''re thinking and acting strangely. As a result of this lack of insight, it''s often down to the person''s friends, relatives or carers to seek help for them. If you''re concerned about someone and think they may have psychosis, you could contact their social worker or community mental health nurse if they''ve previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition. Contact the person''s GP if this is the first time they''ve shown symptoms of psychosis. If you think the person''s symptoms are placing them or others at possible risk of harm you can: take them to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if they agree call their GP or local out-of-hours GP call 999 to ask for an ambulance Further information The following websites provide further information and support: SANE Mind: psychotic experiences Driving If you''ve been diagnosed with psychotic depression, it''s your legal obligation to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).

Hands-only CPR To carry out a chest compression: Place the heel of your hand on the breastbone at the centre of the person’s chest. Place your other hand on top of your first hand and interlock your fingers. Position yourself with your shoulders above your hands. Using your body weight (not just your arms), press straight down by 5-6cm (2-2.5 inches) on their chest. Keeping your hands on their chest, release the compression and allow the chest to return to its original position.   Repeat these compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 times per minute until an ambulance arrives or you become exhausted. When you call for an ambulance, telephone systems now exist that can give basic life-saving instructions, including advice about CPR. These are now common and are easily accessible with mobile phones. CPR with rescue breaths If you’ve been trained in CPR, including rescue breaths, and feel confident using your skills, you should give chest compressions with rescue breaths. If you''re not completely confident, attempt hands-only CPR instead (see above). Adults Place the heel of your hand on the centre of the person''s chest, then place the other hand on top and press down by 5-6cm (2-2.5 inches) at a steady rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute. After every 30 chest compressions, give two rescue breaths. Tilt the casualty''s head gently and lift the chin up with two fingers. Pinch the person’s nose. Seal your mouth over their mouth and blow steadily and firmly into their mouth for about one second. Check that their chest rises. Give two rescue breaths. Continue with cycles of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until they begin to recover or emergency help arrives. Children over one year old Open the child''s airway by placing one hand on the child’s forehead and gently tilting their head back and lifting the chin. Remove any visible obstructions from the mouth and nose. Pinch their nose. Seal your mouth over their mouth and blow steadily and firmly into their mouth, checking that their chest rises. Give five initial rescue breaths. Place the heel of one hand on the centre of their chest and push down by 5cm (about two inches), which is approximately one-third of the chest diameter. The quality (depth) of chest compressions is very important. Use two hands if you can''t achieve a depth of 5cm using one hand. After every 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute, give two breaths. Continue with cycles of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until they begin to recover or emergency help arrives. Infants under one year old Open the infant''s airway by placing one hand on their forehead and gently tilting the head back and lifting the chin. Remove any visible obstructions from the mouth and nose. Place your mouth over the mouth and nose of the infant and blow steadily and firmly into their mouth, checking that their chest rises. Give five initial rescue breaths. Place two fingers in the middle of the chest and push down by 4cm (about 1.5 inches), which is approximately one-third of the chest diameter. The quality (depth) of chest compressions is very important. Use the heel of one hand if you can''t achieve a depth of 4cm using the tips of two fingers. After 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute, give two rescue breaths. Continue with cycles of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until they begin to recover or emergency help arrives. Page last reviewed: 08/01/2016 Next review due: 01/01/2019', -1148917127),

It usually starts during childhood and continues into adulthood. In many cases Tourette''s syndrome runs in families and it''s often associated with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Tourette’s syndrome is named after the French doctor, Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who first described the syndrome and its symptoms in the 19th century. Tics Tics can be: vocal (sounds) – such as grunting, coughing or shouting out words physical (movements) – such as jerking of the head or jumping up and down They can also be: simple – making a small movement or uttering a single sound complex – making a series of physical movements or speaking a long phrase Most people diagnosed with Tourette’s syndrome have a combination of physical and vocal tics, which can be both simple and complex. The tics don''t usually pose a serious threat to a person''s overall health, although physical tics, such as jerking of the head, can often be painful. However, children and adults with Tourette’s syndrome may experience associated problems, such as social isolation, embarrassment and low self-esteem. Read more about the signs and symptoms of Tourette’s syndrome. What causes Tourette''s syndrome? The cause of Tourette’s syndrome is unknown. However, it''s thought to be linked to problems with a part of the brain known as the basal ganglia, which helps regulate body movements. In people with Tourette’s syndrome, the basal ganglia ''misfire'', resulting in the characteristic tics. Read more about the causes of Tourette''s syndrome. Treating Tourette’s syndrome There''s no cure for Tourette''s syndrome, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. If your child is diagnosed with Tourette''s syndrome, their treatment plan may involve a type of psychological therapy, known as behavioural therapy. Two types of behavioural therapy have been shown to reduce the impact and intensity of tics in some people. These are described below. Habit reversal therapy – involves monitoring the pattern and frequency of the tics and identifying any sensations that trigger them. The next stage is to find an alternative, less noticeable method of relieving the sensations that cause a tic (known as premonitory sensations). This is known as a competing response. Exposure with response prevention (ERP) – involves increasing exposure to the urge to tic to suppress the tic response for longer. This works on the theory that you get used to the feeling of needing to tic until the urge, and any related anxiety, weakens. When the tics are more frequent or severe, medication can help to improve them, such as alpha2-adrenergic agonists, muscle relaxants and dopamine antagonists. Surgery may be recommended in particularly severe cases that don''t respond to treatment. However, surgery for Tourette''s syndrome is rare. Read more about how Tourette’s syndrome is treated. Associated conditions Children with Tourette’s syndrome will usually also have one or more other developmental or behavioural conditions. The two most commonly reported conditions are: obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) – a condition characterised by unwanted persistent obsessive thoughts and useless compulsive behaviour, for example, a compulsion to keep washing your hands due to a fear of catching a serious illness attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) – a behavioural condition with symptoms such as a short attention span, being easily distracted, a tendency to be impulsive and not being able to sit still because you are constantly fidgeting (hyperactivity) Children with Tourette’s syndrome may also have other behavioural problems, such as flying into a sudden rage, or behaving inappropriately or anti-socially with other children. In many cases, these associated conditions and behavioural problems can be more disruptive and troublesome than the tics of Tourette’s syndrome, and are the main focus of treatment. Read more about the conditions associated with Tourette’s syndrome. Outlook In around two-thirds of cases of Tourette''s syndrome, symptoms improve significantly (usually around 10 years after they started). In many of these cases, medication or therapy will no longer be needed to control the person''s tics. Some people''s symptoms become less frequent and troublesome, or they disappear completely. In one third of people with Tourette’s syndrome, the symptoms continue throughout their life. However, they usually become milder as the person gets older. This means the need for medication and therapy may pass over time. Who is affected by Tourette’s syndrome? Tourette’s syndrome is more common than most people realise. It affects around one in every 100 people. The symptoms of Tourette''s syndrome usually begin at around seven years of age and become most pronounced at 10–11 years. For unknown reasons, boys are more likely to be affected by Tourette’s syndrome than girls. Tourette''s syndrome (TS) Please enable JavaScript in order to view the video.

It''s most commonly used to treat anxiety and depression, but can be useful for other mental and physical health problems. This topic covers: How it works Uses What happens during a session Pros and cons Finding a therapist How CBT works CBT is based on the concept that your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and actions are interconnected, and that negative thoughts and feelings can trap you in a vicious cycle. CBT aims to help you deal with overwhelming problems in a more positive way by breaking them down into smaller parts. You''re shown how to change these negative patterns to improve the way you feel. Unlike some other talking treatments, CBT deals with your current problems, rather than focusing on issues from your past. It looks for practical ways to improve your state of mind on a daily basis. Read more about how CBT works. Uses for CBT CBT has been shown to be an effective way of treating a number of different mental health conditions. In addition to depression or anxiety disorders, CBT can also help people with: obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)  panic disorder post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) phobias eating disorders – such as anorexia and bulimia sleep problems – such as insomnia problems related to alcohol misuse CBT is also sometimes used to treat people with long-term health conditions, such as: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) Although CBT can''t cure the physical symptoms of these conditions, it can help people cope better with their symptoms. What happens during CBT sessions If CBT is recommended, you''ll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every two weeks. The course of treatment usually lasts for between five and 20 sessions, with each session lasting 30-60 minutes. During the sessions, you''ll work with your therapist to break down your problems into their separate parts – such as your thoughts, physical feelings and actions. You and your therapist will analyse these areas to work out if they''re unrealistic or unhelpful and to determine the effect they have on each other and on you. Your therapist will then be able to help you work out how to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours. After working out what you can change, your therapist will ask you to practise these changes in your daily life and you''ll discuss how you got on during the next session. The eventual aim of therapy is to teach you to apply the skills you''ve learnt during treatment to your daily life. This should help you manage your problems and stop them having a negative impact on your life – even after your course of treatment finishes. Pros and cons of CBT Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be as effective as medication in treating some mental health problems, but it may not be successful or suitable for everyone. Some of the advantages of CBT include: it may be helpful in cases where medication alone hasn''t worked it can be completed in a relatively short period of time compared to other talking therapies the highly structured nature of CBT means it can be provided in different formats, including in groups, self-help books and computer programs it teaches you useful and practical strategies that can be used in everyday life – even after the treatment has finished Some of the disadvantages of CBT to consider include: you need to commit yourself to the process to get the most from it – a therapist can help and advise you, but they need your co-operation attending regular CBT sessions and carrying out any extra work between sessions can take up a lot of your time it may not be suitable for people with more complex mental health needs or learning difficulties – as it requires structured sessions it involves confronting your emotions and anxieties – you may experience initial periods where you''re anxious or emotionally uncomfortable it focuses on the individual’s capacity to change themselves (their thoughts, feelings and behaviours) – which doesn''t address any wider problems in systems or families that often have a significant impact on an individual’s health and wellbeing Some critics also argue that because CBT only addresses current problems and focuses on specific issues, it doesn''t address the possible underlying causes of mental health conditions, such as an unhappy childhood. Finding a CBT therapist If you think you have a problem that may benefit from treatment with CBT, the first step is usually to speak to your GP.  Your GP may be able to refer you for CBT that''s free on the NHS, although you may have to wait.  Find psychological therapy services. If you can afford it, you can choose to pay for your therapy privately. The cost of private therapy sessions varies, but it''s usually £40-100 per session. If you''re considering having CBT privately, ask your GP if they can suggest a local therapist. The British Association for Behavioural & Cognitive Psychotherapies (BABCP) keeps a register of all accredited therapists in the UK and The British Psychological Society (BPS) has a directory of chartered psychologists, some of whom specialise in CBT.

They can include: a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above extreme tiredness sore throat  swollen glands muscle and joint pain loss of appetite hepatitis (inflammation of the liver)  These symptoms will usually last for a couple of weeks. If CMV recurs in someone who''s otherwise healthy, including during pregnancy, it will cause few, if any, symptoms. Weakened immune system Active CMV infection in someone with a weakened immune system can cause a wide range of symptoms, including: a high temperature diarrhoea  shortness of breath  visual problems – such as blind spots, blurring and floaters pneumonia (lung infection) retinitis – inflammation of the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye) hepatitis  These symptoms occur because the virus can quickly spread throughout the body, damaging one or more organs, particularly the digestive system, lungs and eyes. Contact your GP or treatment team immediately if you have one or more of the above symptoms and your immune system is weakened by HIV or organ transplantation. Congenital CMV Around 13% of babies born with congenital CMV will have symptoms at birth. A similar number of babies who don''t have symptoms at birth will develop problems at a later stage. Symptoms at birth Symptoms of congenital CMV at birth can include: jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) pneumonia a rash consisting of small, purplish spots an enlarged liver and spleen low birth weight seizures (fits) small head  Some of these symptoms can be treated, but some babies will develop long-term conditions as a result of the infection. Long-term problems A small proportion of babies with congenital CMV (including those with no symptoms at birth) will develop one or more physical or mental problems at a later stage. These can include: hearing loss (see below) visual impairment or blindness learning difficulties dyspraxia (lack of physical co-ordination) epilepsy CMV infection is responsible for around 25% of cases of hearing loss during childhood. Hearing loss caused by congenital CMV may develop during the first few years of life. This usually gets worse over time. It can also be permanent and range from mild to total. The hearing problems can affect either one or both ears. Children with hearing loss in both ears are also likely to experience difficulties with speech and communication as they get older.

It''s different to acute pancreatitis, where the inflammation is only short-term. The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of abdominal (tummy) pain, which can be severe. Other symptoms tend to develop as the damage to the pancreas progresses, such as producing greasy, foul-smelling stools. Read more about the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis and diagnosing chronic pancreatitis. When to seek medical advice Always visit your GP if you''re experiencing severe pain – it''s a warning sign that something is wrong. Why it happens Long-term alcohol misuse is responsible for around 7 out of every 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis. This is because heavy drinking over a number of years can repeatedly damage the pancreas. Less common causes include: smoking a problem with the immune system, causing it to attack the pancreas an inherited genetic mutation disrupting the functions of the pancreas In as many as 3 out of 10 people with the condition, the cause cannot be identified – this is known as "idiopathic" chronic pancreatitis. Read more about the causes of chronic pancreatitis. Who''s affected Chronic pancreatitis can affect people of any age, but is most common in middle-aged men aged between 45 and 54. Between 2012 and 2013, over 35,000 people visited hospitals in England with the condition. How it''s treated In most cases of chronic pancreatitis, there''s no specific treatment to reduce the inflammation and repair the damage to the pancreas. Treatment mainly focuses on lifestyle changes (see below) and medication to relieve the pain. Surgery is sometimes needed to treat severe chronic pain that doesn''t respond to painkillers. However, the pain can be difficult to treat and can seriously affect your quality of life. People who don''t smoke cigarettes and avoid drinking alcohol tend to experience less pain and live longer than those who continue to drink and smoke after receiving a diagnosis. Read more about treating chronic pancreatitis. Complications Living with chronic pain can cause mental as well as physical strain. It''s important to speak to your GP if you''re experiencing stress, anxiety or depression caused by chronic pancreatitis. Diabetes is a common complication of chronic pancreatitis and affects about a third of people with the condition. It occurs when the pancreas is damaged and unable to produce insulin. People with chronic pancreatitis also have an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Read more about the possible complications of chronic pancreatitis.

They work by killing bacteria or preventing them from reproducing and spreading. Antibiotics aren''t effective against viral infections, such as the common cold, flu, most coughs and sore throats. Many mild bacterial infections can also be cleared by your immune system without using antibiotics, so they aren''t routinely prescribed. It''s important that antibiotics are prescribed and taken correctly to help prevent the progression of antibiotic resistance. This is when a strain of bacteria no longer responds to treatment with one or more types of antibiotics. When antibiotics are used Antibiotics may be used to treat bacterial infections that: are unlikely to clear up without antibiotics could infect others unless treated could take too long to clear without treatment carry a risk of more serious complications People at a high risk of infection may also be given antibiotics as a precaution, known as antibiotic prophylaxis. Read more about when antibiotics are used. How do I take antibiotics? Take antibiotics as directed on the packet or the patient information leaflet that comes with the medication, or as instructed by your GP or pharmacist. Doses of antibiotics can be provided in several ways: oral antibiotics – tablets, capsules or a liquid that you drink, which can be used to treat most types of mild to moderate infections in the body topical antibiotics – creams, lotions, sprays or drops, which are often used to treat skin infections injections of antibiotics – these can be given as an injection or infusion through a drip directly into the blood or muscle, and are usually reserved for more serious infections It''s essential to finish taking a prescribed course of antibiotics, even if you feel better, unless a healthcare professional tells you otherwise. If you stop taking an antibiotic part way through a course, the bacteria can become resistant to the antibiotic. Missing a dose of antibiotics If you forget to take a dose of your antibiotics, take that dose as soon as you remember and then continue to take your course of antibiotics as normal. But if it''s almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Don''t take a double dose to make up for a missed one. There''s an increased risk of side effects if you take two doses closer together than recommended. Accidentally taking an extra dose Accidentally taking one extra dose of your antibiotic is unlikely to cause you any serious harm. But it will increase your chances of experiencing side effects, such as pain in your stomach, diarrhoea, and feeling or being sick. If you accidentally take more than one extra dose of your antibiotic, are worried or experiencing severe side effects, speak to your GP or call NHS 111 as soon as possible. Side effects of antibiotics As with any medication, antibiotics can cause side effects. Most antibiotics don''t cause problems if they''re used properly and serious side effects are rare. The most common side effects include: being sick feeling sick bloating and indigestion diarrhoea Some people may have an allergic reaction to antibiotics, especially penicillin and a type called cephalosporins. In very rare cases, this can lead to a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which is a medical emergency. Read more about the side effects of antibiotics. Considerations and interactions Some antibiotics aren''t suitable for people with certain medical conditions, or women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. You should only ever take antibiotics prescribed for you – never "borrow" them from a friend or family member. Some antibiotics can also react unpredictably with other medications, such as the oral contraceptive pill and alcohol. It''s important to read the information leaflet that comes with your medication carefully and discuss any concerns with your pharmacist or GP. Read more about: things to consider before taking antibiotics how antibiotics interact with other medicines Types of antibiotics There are hundreds of different types of antibiotics, but most of them can be broadly classified into six groups. These are outlined below. penicillins (such as penicillin and amoxicillin) – widely used to treat a variety of infections, including skin infections, chest infections and urinary tract infections cephalosporins (such as cephalexin) – used to treat a wide range of infections, but some are also effective for treating more serious infections, such as septicaemia and meningitis aminoglycosides (such as gentamicin and tobramycin) – tend to only be used in hospital to treat very serious illnesses such as septicaemia, as they can cause serious side effects, including hearing loss and kidney damage; they''re usually given by injection, but may be given as drops for some ear or eye infections tetracyclines (such as tetracycline and doxycycline)– can be used to treat a wide range of infections, but are commonly used to treat moderate to severe acne and rosacea macrolides (such as erythromycin and clarithromycin) – can be particularly useful for treating lung and chest infections, or an alternative for people with a penicillin allergy, or to treat penicillin-resistant strains of bacteria fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) – broad-spectrum antibiotics that can be used to treat a wide range of infections Antibiotic resistance Both the NHS and health organisations across the world are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics, especially for conditions that aren''t serious. The overuse of antibiotics in recent years means they''re becoming less effective and has led to the emergence of "superbugs". These are strains of bacteria that have developed resistance to many different types of antibiotics, including: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)  Clostridium difficile (C. diff) the bacteria that cause multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) These types of infections can be serious and challenging to treat, and are becoming an increasing cause of disability and death across the world. The biggest worry is that new strains of bacteria may emerge that can''t be effectively treated by any existing antibiotics.

Bile ducts are small tubes that connect the liver and small intestine. They allow fluid called bile to flow from the liver, through the pancreas, to the gut, where it helps with digestion. Cancer can affect any part of these ducts. Bile duct cancer can sometimes be cured if caught very early on, but it''s not usually picked up until a later stage, when a cure isn''t possible. This page covers: Symptoms Causes Tests Treatments Outlook Symptoms of bile duct cancer There aren''t usually any symptoms of bile duct cancer until it grows large enough to block the bile ducts. This can cause: yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) itchy skin pale stools and dark urine loss of appetite and weight loss  persistent tiredness and feeling unwell tummy (abdominal) pain and swelling – some people feel a dull ache in the upper right hand side of their tummy high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above chills and shivering See your GP if you have persistent symptoms that you''re worried about – particularly if you have jaundice. These symptoms can have a number of causes, so it''s important to get a proper diagnosis. Causes of bile duct cancer The exact cause of bile duct cancer is unknown. Most occur without a clear cause, although some things can increase your risk of getting it. These include: primary sclerosing cholangitis – a rare type of liver disease that causes long-term inflammation of the liver bile duct abnormalities – such as cysts (fluid-filled sacs) in the bile ducts that are present from birth biliary stones within the liver – hard stones, similar to gallstones, that form in the bile duct infection with a liver fluke parasite (mostly a problem in Asia) exposure to certain chemicals and toxins, including thorotrast (a special dye that used to be used in medical scans) There may also be a link with long-term hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections, liver scarring (cirrhosis), diabetes, obesity, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Tests for bile duct cancer Several tests may be needed to help diagnose bile duct cancer. These will usually be carried out in hospital. Tests you may have include:  blood tests to check for signs of cancer or a problem with your liver scans, such as an ultrasound scan, computerised tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan detailed X-rays taken after a special dye has been injected into your bile ducts to make them show up more clearly a biopsy – where a small sample of tissue is removed so it can be looked at under a microscope for signs of cancer Read more about how bile duct cancer is diagnosed. Treatments for bile duct cancer It''s not usually possible to cure bile duct cancer because it''s often only diagnosed after it has grown and spread. But even in these cases, treatment can help control the symptoms for months or possibly years. The main treatments for bile duct cancer are: surgery to remove the affected area – this is only suitable for a small number of people, but could get rid of the cancer completely inserting a hollow tube (stent) into the bile duct to stop it becoming blocked – this can help relieve symptoms such as jaundice chemotherapy – where medication is given to stop the cancer cells growing and to relieve your symptoms radiotherapy – where a beam of radiation is carefully aimed at the cancer cells to stop them growing and to relieve your symptoms Read more about how bile duct cancer is treated.   Outlook for bile duct cancer The outlook for bile duct cancer depends on which part of the bile duct is affected and how far the cancer has grown. Even if it''s possible to remove the cancer, there''s a chance it could come back later.  Overall: one in every two to five people (20-50%) will live at least five years if bile duct cancer is caught early on and surgery is carried out to try to remove it one in every 50 people (2%) will live at least five years if it''s caught at a later stage and surgery to remove it isn''t possible Cancer Research UK has more information about survival statistics for bile duct cancer.

(380, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/scarlet-fever/pages/introduction.aspx', 'scarlet fever', 'Scarlet fever - NHS Choices', 'Scarlet fever  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Scarlet fever is a bacterial illness that mainly affects children. It causes a distinctive pink-red rash. The illness is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, also known as group A streptococcus, which are found on the skin and in the throat. Generally, scarlet fever is much less common than it used to be but in recent years there have been a number of significant outbreaks. For example, figures published by Public Health England show that from September 2013 to March 2014 there were 2,830 cases of scarlet fever. For the same period in 2014/15 a total of 5,746 cases were recorded. The reason for recent increase is unclear. It’s important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of scarlet fever so that early treatment with antibiotics can be given. Scarlet fever symptoms Scarlet fever usually follows a sore throat or a skin infection, such as impetigo, caused by particular strains of streptococcus bacteria. Initial symptoms usually include a sore throat, headache and a high temperature (38.3C/101F or above), flushed cheeks and a swollen tongue. A day or two later the characteristic pinkish rash appears. It usually occurs on the chest and stomach before spreading to other areas of the body, such as the ears and neck. The symptoms of scarlet fever usually develop two to five days after infection, although the incubation period (the period between exposure to the infection and symptoms appearing) can be as short as one day or as long as seven days. The rash feels like sandpaper to touch and it may be itchy. On darker skin the rash may be more difficult to see although its rough texture should be apparent. When to seek medical advice Scarlet fever usually clears up after about a week, but if you think you or your child may have it, see your GP for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Your GP should be able to diagnose scarlet fever by examining the distinctive rash and asking about other symptoms. They may also decide to take a sample of saliva from the back of the throat so it can be tested in a laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. There''s no evidence to suggest that catching scarlet fever when pregnant will put your baby at risk. However, if you''re heavily pregnant, tell the doctors and midwives in charge of your care if you''ve been in contact with someone who has scarlet fever. How scarlet fever spreads Scarlet fever is very contagious and can be caught by: breathing in bacteria in airborne droplets from an infected person''s coughs and sneezes touching the skin of a person with a streptococcal skin infection, such as impetigo sharing contaminated towels, baths, clothes or bed linen It can also be caught from carriers – people who have the bacteria in their throat or on their skin but don''t have any symptoms. Who''s affected by scarlet fever Most cases (about 80%) of scarlet fever occur in children under 10 (usually between two and eight years of age). However, people of any age can get the illness. As it''s so contagious, scarlet fever is likely to affect someone in close contact with a person with a sore throat or skin infection caused by streptococcus bacteria. Outbreaks often occur in nurseries and schools where children are in close contact with one another. The symptoms of scarlet fever will only develop in people susceptible to toxins produced by the streptococcus bacteria. Most children over 10 years of age will have developed immunity to these toxins. It''s possible to catch scarlet fever more than once, but this is rare. Treating scarlet fever Scarlet fever used to be a very serious illness, but nowadays most cases tend to be mild. It can easily be treated with antibiotics. Liquid antibiotics, such as penicillin or amoxicillin, are often used to treat children. These must be taken for 10 days, even though most people recover after four to five days. It''s important to be aware that your child will still be infectious for 24 hours after antibiotic treatment has begun, and therefore they shouldn''t attend nursery or school during this period (see below). Without antibiotic treatment, your child will be infectious for 1-2 weeks after symptoms appear. Read more about treating scarlet fever. Complications of scarlet fever With the right treatment, further problems are unlikely. However, there''s a small risk of the infection spreading to other parts of the body and causing more serious infections, such as an ear infection, sinusitis, or pneumonia. Read more about complications of scarlet fever. Preventing scarlet fever from spreading There’s currently no vaccine for scarlet fever. If your child has scarlet fever, keep them away from nursery or school for at least 24 hours after starting treatment with antibiotics. Adults with the illness should also stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment. GPs, schools and nurseries should be aware of the current high levels of scarlet fever and inform local health protection teams if they become aware of cases, particularly if more than one child is affected. Children and adults should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze and wash their hands with soap and water after using or disposing of tissues. Avoid sharing contaminated utensils, cups and glasses, clothes, baths, bed linen or towels. Scarlatina Scarlet fever is also sometimes known as scarlatina, although this often refers to a milder form of the illness.

It can be serious if not treated promptly. The infection develops suddenly and can spread through the body quickly. Severe infections can spread deep into the body, and can be life threatening. Most cases are successfully treated with antibiotics at home, although sometimes it needs to be treated in hospital. This page covers: Symptoms When to get medical advice Treatments Outlook Causes Prevention Symptoms of cellulitis Cellulitis causes an area of skin to suddenly become: red hot swollen painful tender It most often affects the lower legs, but can occur anywhere. In more severe cases, cellulitis can also be accompanied – and often preceded – by: a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above vigorous shaking (rigors) nausea and vomiting dizziness confusion These are signs that the infection has spread deeper into the body. Read more about the symptoms of cellulitis. When to get medical advice See your GP or visit your nearest minor injuries unit as soon as possible if an area of your skin suddenly turns red, painful and hot. Early treatment can help reduce the risk of the infection becoming severe. Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately if: your face or the area around your eye is affected your symptoms are getting rapidly worse you experience other symptoms in addition to the changes in your skin, such as a fever or vomiting you have a weak immune system – for example, because of HIV or chemotherapy – or severe lymphoedema, a condition that causes swelling in the body''s tissues a young child or elderly person has possible cellulitis Treatments for cellulitis Cellulitis is usually treated with antibiotics. Many infections can be treated with antibiotic tablets at home. You''ll usually be given a seven-day course of tablets, and your symptoms should start to improve after a few days. Make sure you complete the whole course of medicine you''ve been given, even if you''re feeling better. Contact your GP if your symptoms get worse after a few days or don''t improve within a week. For serious infections, treatment is usually started in hospital. You''ll normally be given antibiotics directly into a vein through an injection or a drip. Many hospitals can then arrange for this treatment to continue at home or in an outpatient clinic. Treatment is usually for seven days. If the infection responds to treatment quickly, it may be possible to complete the course with antibiotic tablets instead of having injections or a drip. Read more about how cellulitis is treated. Outlook for cellulitis Cellulitis can usually be treated successfully with antibiotics, and most people make a full recovery. But there is a risk it could cause potentially serious problems, particularly if it''s not treated quickly, such as: blood poisoning (septicaemia) – where the bacteria enter the blood kidney damage leg ulcers Septicaemia and kidney problems can be life threatening and require immediate treatment in hospital. Causes of cellulitis Cellulitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection. The bacteria that cause it often live harmlessly on the skin, but they can lead to an infection if they get into a break in your skin, such as: a bruise, cut or graze  an animal bite or insect bite a leg ulcer dry, cracked skin – for example, because of eczema or athlete''s foot In most cases the trigger for the infection is unknown. The infection isn''t normally spread from person to person. Read about the causes of cellulitis, including information on who''s most at risk of the condition. Preventing cellulitis If you''ve had cellulitis before, you''re more likely to get it again. It''s not always possible to prevent it, but the following measures may help reduce your risk: use moisturiser if your skin is dry or prone to cracking lose weight if you''re overweight – being obese can increase your risk of cellulitis try to ensure any conditions that can increase your risk of cellulitis – such as eczema, athlete''s foot, leg ulcers and lymphoedema – are well managed make sure any cuts, grazes or bites are kept clean – wash them under running tap water and cover them with a plaster or dressing wash your hands regularly – particularly when treating or touching a wound or skin condition If you get cellulitis often or severely, your GP may refer you to a skin specialist called a dermatologist, or an infection specialist, to discuss the option of taking antibiotics on a long-term basis to protect against further infections. Cellulitis and cellulite Cellulite is a cosmetic problem caused by fatty deposits that form underneath the skin. It is not related to cellulitis. If you''re overweight, losing weight is the best way of dealing with cellulite. Read more information and advice about losing weight.

These can include: feeling dizzy or faint a change in mental state – such as confusion or disorientation diarrhoea  nausea and vomiting slurred speech severe muscle pain severe breathlessness less urine production than normal – for example, not urinating for a day cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin loss of consciousness When to get medical help Seek medical advice urgently from NHS 111 if you''ve recently had an infection or injury and you have possible early signs of sepsis. If sepsis is suspected, you''ll usually be referred to hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. Severe sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies. If you think you or someone in your care has one of these conditions, go straight to A&E or call 999.  Tests to diagnose sepsis Sepsis is often diagnosed based on simple measurements such as your temperature, heart rate and breathing rate. You may need to give a blood test. Other tests can help determine the type of infection, where it''s located and which body functions have been affected. These include: urine or stool samples a wound culture – where a small sample of tissue, skin or fluid is taken from the affected area for testing respiratory secretion testing – taking a sample of saliva, phlegm or mucus blood pressure tests imaging studies – such as an X-ray, ultrasound scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan Treatments for sepsis If sepsis is detected early and hasn''t affected vital organs yet, it may be possible to treat the infection at home with antibiotics. Most people who have sepsis detected at this stage make a full recovery. Almost all people with severe sepsis and septic shock require admission to hospital. Some people may require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Because of problems with vital organs, people with severe sepsis are likely to be very ill and the condition can be fatal. However, sepsis is treatable if it is identified and treated quickly, and in most cases leads to a full recovery with no lasting problems. Read more about treating sepsis. Recovering from sepsis Some people make a full recovery fairly quickly. The amount of time it takes to fully recover from sepsis varies, depending on: the severity of the sepsis the person''s overall health how much time was spent in hospital whether treatment was needed in an ICU Some people experience long-term physical and/or psychological problems during their recovery period, such as: feeling lethargic or excessively tired muscle weakness swollen limbs or joint pain chest pain or breathlessness These long-term problems are known as post-sepsis syndrome. Not everyone experiences these problems. Read more about recovering from sepsis on the UK Sepsis Trust website. Who''s at risk? There are around 123,000 cases of sepsis a year in England. Around 37,000 people die every year as a result of the condition. Anyone can develop sepsis after an injury or minor infection, although some people are more vulnerable. People most at risk of sepsis include those: with a medical condition or receiving medical treatment that weakens their immune system who are already in hospital with a serious illness who are very young or very old who have just had surgery or who have wounds or injuries as a result of an accident Read more about the causes of sepsis. Sepsis, septicaemia and blood poisoning Although sepsis is often referred to as either blood poisoning or septicaemia, these terms refer to the invasion of bacteria into the bloodstream. Sepsis can affect multiple organs or the entire body, even without blood poisoning or septicaemia. Sepsis can also be caused by viral or fungal infections, although bacterial infections are by far the most common cause.

Atopic eczema is more common in children, often developing before their first birthday. However, it may also develop for the first time in adults. It''s usually a long-term (chronic) condition, although it can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older. This topic covers: Symptoms When to seek medical advice Causes Treatment Other types of eczema Symptoms of atopic eczema Atopic eczema causes the skin to become itchy, dry, cracked, sore and red. Some people only have small patches of dry skin, but others may experience widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body.             Although atopic eczema can affect any part of the body, it most often affects the hands, insides of the elbows, backs of the knees and the face and scalp in children. People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups). Read about the symptoms of atopic eczema  When to seek medical advice See your GP if you have symptoms of atopic eczema. They''ll usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions such as: whether the rash is itchy and where it appears when the symptoms first began whether it comes and goes over time whether there''s a history of atopic eczema in your family whether you have any other conditions, such as allergies or asthma whether something in your diet or lifestyle may be contributing to your symptoms Typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and three or more of the following: visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin – such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above generally dry skin in the last 12 months a history of asthma or hay fever – children under four must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has one of these conditions the condition started before the age of two (this does not apply to children under the age of four) Causes of atopic eczema The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it''s clear it is not down to one single thing. Atopic eczema often occurs in people who get allergies – "atopic" means sensitivity to allergens. It can run in families, and often develops alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever. The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather. Sometimes food allergies can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema. You may be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse. Allergy tests aren''t usually needed, although they''re sometimes helpful in identifying whether a food allergy may be triggering symptoms. Read about the causes of atopic eczema. Treating atopic eczema  Treatment for atopic eczema can help to relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time. However, there''s currently no cure and severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life, which may be difficult to cope with physically and mentally. There''s also an increased risk of skin infections.  Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including: self care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers emollients (moisturising treatments) – used on a daily basis for dry skin  topical corticosteroids – used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups Read about treating atopic eczema and complications of atopic eczema. Other types of eczema Eczema is the name for a group of skin conditions that cause dry, irritated skin. Other types of eczema include: discoid eczema – a type of eczema that occurs in circular or oval patches on the skin contact dermatitis – a type of eczema that occurs when the body comes into contact with a particular substance varicose eczema – a type of eczema that most often affects the lower legs and is caused by problems with the flow of blood through the leg veins seborrhoeic eczema – a type of eczema where red, scaly patches develop on the sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears and scalp dyshidrotic eczema (pompholyx) – a type of eczema that causes tiny blisters to erupt across the palms of the hands Page last reviewed: 02/12/2016 Next review due: 02/12/2019', 1698116091),

But occasionally they can become infected, cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or spread serious illnesses such as Lyme disease and malaria. Bugs that bite or sting include wasps, hornets, bees, horseflies, ticks, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, spiders and midges. This page covers: Symptoms What to do if you''ve been bitten or stung When to get medical advice When to get emergency medical help Prevention Symptoms of insect bites and stings Insect bites and stings will usually cause a red, swollen lump to develop on the skin. This may be painful and in some cases can be very itchy. The symptoms will normally improve within a few hours or days, although sometimes they can last a little longer. Some people have a mild allergic reaction and a larger area of skin around the bite or sting becomes swollen, red and painful. This should pass within a week. Occasionally, a severe allergic reaction can occur, causing symptoms such as breathing difficulties, dizziness and a swollen face or mouth. This requires immediate medical treatment (see below). Read more about the symptoms of common insect bites and stings. What to do if you''ve been bitten or stung To treat an insect bite or sting: Remove the sting or tick if it''s still in the skin (see treating insect bites and stings for advice about how to do this safely). Wash the affected area with soap and water. Apply a cold compress (such as a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) or an ice pack to any swelling for at least 10 minutes. Raise or elevate the affected area if possible, as this can help reduce swelling. Avoid scratching the area, to reduce the risk of infection. Avoid traditional home remedies, such as vinegar and bicarbonate of soda, as they''re unlikely to help. The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as painkillers, creams for itching and antihistamines. Read more about treatments for insect bites and stings. When to get medical advice Contact your GP or call NHS 111 for advice if: you''re worried about a bite or sting your symptoms don''t start to improve within a few days or are getting worse you''ve been stung or bitten in your mouth or throat, or near your eyes a large area (around 10cm or more) around the bite becomes red and swollen you have symptoms of a wound infection, such as pus or increasing pain, swelling or redness you have symptoms of a more widespread infection, such as a fever, swollen glands and other flu-like symptoms When to get emergency medical help Dial 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe reaction, such as: wheezing or difficulty breathing a swollen face, mouth or throat nausea or vomiting a fast heart rate dizziness or feeling faint difficulty swallowing loss of consciousness Emergency treatment in hospital is needed in these cases. Prevent insect bites and stings There are some simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of being bitten or stung by insects. For example, you should: Remain calm and move away slowly if you encounter wasps, hornets or bees – don''t wave your arms around or swat at them. Cover exposed skin by wearing long sleeves and trousers. Wear shoes when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin – repellents that contain 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective. Avoid using products with strong perfumes, such as soaps, shampoos and deodorants – these can attract insects. Be careful around flowering plants, rubbish, compost, stagnant water, and in outdoor areas where food is served. You may need to take extra precautions if you''re travelling to part of the world where there''s a risk of serious illnesses. For example, you may be advised to take antimalarial tablets to help prevent malaria. Read more about how to prevent insect bites and stings.

Treatment is often recommended as it can help clear up the infection in around seven to 10 days and reduce the risk of the infection being passed on to others. If impetigo is confirmed, it can usually be effectively treated with antibiotics. If the infection is being caused by an underlying skin condition, such as eczema, this may also need to be treated. Antibiotic cream For mild cases of impetigo that cover a small area, antibiotic cream is often recommended. This usually needs to be applied three or four times a day for seven days. Before applying the cream, wash any affected areas of skin with warm, soapy water and try to clean off any crusts that have developed. To reduce the risk of spreading the infection, it''s also important that you wash your hands immediately after applying the cream or, if available, wear latex gloves while applying the cream. Side effects of antibiotic cream can include: irritation redness itchiness in the area where the cream is applied If symptoms haven''t improved after seven days of starting treatment, speak to your GP about other possible treatment options. Antibiotic tablets Antibiotic tablets may be prescribed if the infection is more severe and widespread, or if the symptoms don''t improve after using antibiotic cream. These usually need to be taken two to four times a day for seven days. If a course of oral antibiotics is prescribed for you or your child, it''s very important that the course is finished even if the symptoms clear up before you''ve taken all the tablets.  Common side effects of oral antibiotics include: feeling sick vomiting diarrhoea Speak to your GP if your symptoms haven''t improved after seven days of treatment with antibiotic tablets. Further testing and treatment Further tests are usually only required in cases where the infection is severe or widespread, doesn''t respond to treatment, or keeps recurring. In these circumstances, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) for further tests or they may take a swab of the affected skin themselves for testing. This can help to rule out or confirm other skin conditions that may be responsible for your symptoms and can detect whether you carry one of the types of bacteria responsible for the infection inside your nose. If your doctor thinks you may keep getting impetigo because you naturally have these bacteria inside your nose, they may prescribe you an antiseptic nasal cream to try to clear the bacteria.

He told me to separate my children''s flannels and towels as the infection spreads so easily. But it was too late. "I think the kids got their flannels mixed up, because, by then, my ten-year-old daughter Sinead had caught it too. Then they passed it to their baby brother. "I had them all treated with antibiotics that Monday, and by Friday the spots had gone completely. "Luckily it was the holidays, so I didn''t need to keep them off school. For the first few days of treatment, when the spots were still weeping, I kept them inside and they played together in the house. During this time I constantly had to remind them to stop scratching their spots. "My daughter got a bit moody about not seeing her friends during those days, but they coped fine otherwise and are clear of impetigo now."

Some types and pack sizes are only available from pharmacy counters, and some only on prescription. Ibuprofen is available in many forms, including: tablets capsules liquids gels or creams sprays In some products ibuprofen is combined with other ingredients. For example, it''s sometimes combined with medicine for a blocked nose (a decongestant) and sold as a cold and flu remedy. Who can take ibuprofen Some people should avoid using ibuprofen and others should use it with caution. If you have any queries about using ibuprofen or any other medicines, speak to your GP or pharmacist, or call NHS 111. You shouldn''t take ibuprofen if you: have a history of a strong, unpleasant reaction (hypersensitivity) to aspirin or other NSAIDs currently have or recently had a stomach ulcer, or you have had one in the past have severe heart failure have severe liver disease are taking low-dose aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular disease You should use ibuprofen with caution if you''re aged 65 or over, breastfeeding, or have: asthma kidney or liver problems lupus Crohn''s disease or ulcerative colitis previously had any bleeding in your stomach high blood pressure (hypertension) narrowing of the arteries (peripheral arterial disease) any problems with your heart, such as angina, heart attacks, or mild or moderate heart failure had a stroke Ibuprofen and pregnancy Ideally, pregnant women shouldn''t take ibuprofen unless a doctor recommends and prescribes it. It''s best to tell your GP, pharmacist or health visitor about any medicines you''re taking. Paracetamol is recommended as an alternative to ease short-term pain or reduce a high temperature. Ibuprofen and breastfeeding Ibuprofen appears in breast milk in small amounts, so it''s unlikely to cause any harm to your baby while you''re breastfeeding. Ibuprofen and children Ibuprofen may be given to children aged three months or over who weigh at least 5kg (11lbs) to relieve pain, inflammation or fever. Your GP or another healthcare professional may recommend ibuprofen for younger children in certain cases – for example, this may be to control a fever after a vaccination if paracetamol is unsuitable. If your baby or child has a high temperature that doesn''t get better or they continue to experience pain, speak to your GP or call NHS 111. How to take ibuprofen Make sure you use ibuprofen as directed on the label or leaflet, or as instructed by a health professional. How much you can take depends on your age, the type of ibuprofen you''re taking and how strong it is. For example: adults – can usually take one or two 200mg tablets every four to six hours, but shouldn''t take more than 1,200mg (six 200mg) tablets in the space of 24 hours children under 16 – may need to take a lower dose depending on their age; check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice The painkilling effect of ibuprofen begins soon after a dose is taken, but the anti-inflammatory effect can sometimes take up to three weeks to get the best results. Ibuprofen shouldn''t be used to treat conditions that are mainly related to inflammation. Don''t take more than the recommended dose if it isn''t relieving your symptoms. Adults can take paracetamol at the same time as ibuprofen if necessary, but this isn''t recommended for children. For more details, see Can I take paracetamol and ibuprofen together?. Contact your GP or call NHS 111 if your symptoms get worse or last more than three days despite taking ibuprofen. Interactions with medicines, food and alcohol Ibuprofen can react unpredictably with certain other medicines. This can affect how well either medicine works and increase the risk of side effects. Check the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with ibuprofen. Ask your GP or local pharmacist if you''re not sure.  As ibuprofen is a type of NSAID, you shouldn''t take more than one of these at a time or you''ll have an increased risk of side effects.  NSAIDs can also interact with many other medicines, including: some types of antidepressants – used to treat depression beta-blockers – used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) diuretics – which reduce the amount of fluid in your body Read more about medicines that interact with NSAIDs. Ibuprofen can also interact with ginkgo biloba, a controversial dietary supplement some people claim can treat memory problems and dementia. There are no known problems caused by taking ibuprofen with any specific foods or by drinking a moderate amount of alcohol. Side effects of ibuprofen Ibuprofen can cause a number of side effects. You should take the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time needed to control your symptoms. See the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for a full list of side effects. Common side effects of ibuprofen include: nausea or vomiting constipation or diarrhoea indigestion (dyspepsia) or abdominal pain Less common side effects include: headache or dizziness bloating (fluid retention) raised blood pressure inflammation of the stomach (gastritis) a stomach ulcer allergic reactions – such as a rash worsening of asthma symptoms by causing narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) kidney failure black stools and blood in your vomit – this can indicate bleeding in your stomach If you feel unwell after taking ibuprofen or have concerns, speak to your GP or pharmacist, or call NHS 111. You can also report suspected side effects using the Yellow Card Scheme. High doses Taking high doses of ibuprofen over long periods of time can increase your risk of: stroke – when the blood supply to the brain is disturbed heart attacks – when the blood supply to the heart is blocked In women, long-term use of ibuprofen might be associated with reduced fertility. This is usually reversible when you stop taking ibuprofen. Overdoses of ibuprofen Taking too much ibuprofen, known as an overdose, can be very dangerous. If you''ve taken more than the recommended maximum dose, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible. It can be helpful to take any remaining medicine and the box or leaflet with you to A&E if you can. Some people feel sick, vomit, have abdominal pain or ringing in their ears (tinnitus) after taking too much ibuprofen, but often there are no symptoms at first. Go to A&E even if you''re feeling well. Page last reviewed: 17/05/2016 Next review due: 01/05/2019', 1681667131),

It’s most recognisable by the painful swellings at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), giving a person with mumps a distinctive "hamster face" appearance. Other symptoms of mumps include headaches, joint pain and a high temperature, which may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands. When to see your GP It''s important to contact your GP if you suspect mumps so a diagnosis can be made. While mumps isn''t usually serious, the condition has similar symptoms to more serious types of infection, such as glandular fever and tonsillitis. Your GP can usually make a diagnosis after seeing and feeling the swelling, looking at the position of the tonsils in the mouth and checking the person''s temperature to see if it''s higher than normal. Let your GP know in advance if you''re coming to the surgery, so they can take any necessary precautions to prevent the spread of infection. If your GP suspects mumps, they should notify your local health protection unit (HPU). The HPU will arrange for a sample of saliva to be tested to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. How mumps is spread Mumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu – through infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and transferred into the mouth or nose.   A person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards. During this time, it''s important to prevent the infection spreading to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who haven''t been vaccinated. If you have mumps, you can help prevent it spreading by: regularly washing your hands with soap using and disposing of tissues when you sneeze avoiding school or work for at least five days after your symptoms first develop Preventing mumps You can protect your child against mumps by making sure they''re given the combined MMR vaccine (for mumps, measles and rubella). The MMR vaccine is part of the routine NHS childhood immunisation schedule. Your child should be given one dose when they are around 12-13 months and a second booster dose before they start school. Once both doses are given, the vaccine provides 95% protection against mumps. Treatment for mumps There''s currently no cure for mumps, but the infection should pass within one or two weeks. Treatment is used to relieve symptoms and includes: getting plenty of bed rest and fluids using painkillers, such as ibuprofen and paracetamol – aspirin shouldn''t be given to children under 16 applying a warm or cool compress to the swollen glands to help relieve pain Read more about treating mumps. Complications Mumps usually passes without causing serious damage to a person''s health. Serious complications are rare. However, mumps can lead to viral meningitis if the virus moves into the outer layer of the brain. Other complications include swelling of the testicles in males or the ovaries in females (if the affected male or female has gone through puberty). Read more about the complications of mumps. Who is affected Most cases of mumps occur in young adults (usually born between 1980 and 1990) who didn’t receive the MMR vaccine as part of their childhood vaccination schedule or didn''t have mumps as a child. There were 2,224 confirmed cases of mumps in England and Wales during 2014. Once you''ve been infected by the mumps virus, you normally develop a life-long immunity to further infection. Page last reviewed: 07/08/2015 Next review due: 01/08/2018', 1875416256),

Stay away from work or school for at least four days from when the measles rash first appears to reduce the risk of spreading the infection. You should also try to avoid contact with people who are more vulnerable to the infection, such as young children and pregnant women. Relieving symptoms If the symptoms of measles are causing discomfort for you or your child, there are some things you can do to treat these while you wait for your body to fight off the virus. Controlling fever and relieving pain Paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to reduce a high temperature (fever) and relieve any aches or pains if your child is uncomfortable. Liquid infant paracetamol can be used for young children. Aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old. Speak to your pharmacist if you''re not sure which medications are suitable for your child. Drink plenty of fluids If your child has a high temperature, make sure they drink plenty of fluids as they may be at risk of dehydration. Keeping hydrated may also help reduce throat discomfort caused by coughing. Treating sore eyes You can gently clean away any crustiness from your child''s eyelids and lashes using cotton wool soaked in water. Closing curtains or dimming lights can help if bright light is hurting their eyes. Treating cold-like symptoms If your child has cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose or a cough, there are a number of things you can do to help them feel more comfortable. For example, it might help your child if they sit in a hot, steamy bathroom. Or you could put a wet towel on a warm radiator to moisten the air, which may help ease your child''s cough. Drinking warm drinks, particularly ones containing lemon or honey, may also help to relax the airways, loosen mucus, and soothe a cough. Honey should not be given to babies under 12 months. Spotting signs of serious illness If you or your child has measles, you should keep an eye out for any signs of the serious complications that can sometimes develop. Signs of a more serious problem include: shortness of breath a sharp chest pain that feels worse with breathing coughing up blood drowsiness confusion fits (convulsions) Go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department or call 999 for an ambulance if you or your child develop any of these symptoms.

Inflammation is your immune system''s natural response to injury or infection. It causes swelling, and can help the body deal with invading germs. But in vasculitis, for some reason the immune system attacks healthy blood vessels, causing them to become swollen and narrow. This may be triggered by an infection or medication, although often the cause is unknown. Vasculitis can range from a minor problem that just affects the skin, to a more serious illness that causes problems with organs such as the heart or kidneys. There are many types of vasculitis. This page covers: Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome) Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener''s granulomatosis)  Henoch-Schönlein purpura  Kawasaki disease Microscopic polyangiitis Polyarteritis nodosa  Polymyalgia rheumatica  Takayasu arteritis  Other types of vasculitis  Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome) Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, also called Churg-Strauss syndrome, is a type of vasculitis that mainly affects adults aged 30 to 45. It can cause: asthma allergic rhinitis (cold-like symptoms caused by allergies) a high temperature (fever) muscle and joint pain tiredness loss of appetite and weight loss It can also affect the nerves, causing weakness, pins and needles or numbness, and it sometimes damages the kidneys or heart muscle. It''s usually treated with steroid medication. The Vasculitis UK website has more information about eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) Giant cell arteritis is a type of vasculitis that often affects the arteries in the head and neck. It mostly occurs in adults over the age of 50. It''s sometimes called temporal arteritis because the arteries around the temples are often affected. It can cause: aching and soreness around the temples jaw muscle pain while eating headaches double vision or vision loss It also commonly occurs alongside polymyalgia rheumatica (see below). The main treatment is steroid medication.  Read more about giant cell arteritis. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener''s granulomatosis)  Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, also called Wegener''s granulomatosis, is a type of vasculitis that mainly affects blood vessels in the nose, sinuses, ears, lungs and kidneys. It mainly affects middle-aged or elderly people. It can cause: a high temperature (fever) night sweats inflammation of the sinuses (sinusitis) nosebleeds and crusting of the nose shortness of breath and coughing up blood kidney problems It''s a serious condition that can be fatal if left untreated, as it can lead to organ failure. It''s usually treated with steroid medication or other medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system. Read more about granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Henoch-Schönlein purpura Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a rare type of vasculitis that usually occurs in children and can affect the skin, kidneys or bowel. It''s thought to be triggered by the body reacting to an infection. It can cause: a rash that looks like small bruises or reddish-purple spots joint pain tummy (abdominal) pain diarrhoea and vomiting blood in urine or poo It''s not usually serious and tends to get better without treatment. Read more about Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Kawasaki disease Kawasaki disease is a rare condition that can occur in children under five. The trigger is thought to be an infection, although the exact cause is not fully understood. It can cause: a high temperature (fever) that lasts for more than five days a rash swollen glands in the neck red fingers or toes, red eyes, and redness of the lips, tongue or mouth Kawasaki disease can affect the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart, so some children experience heart problems. It usually needs to be treated in hospital with aspirin and a treatment called immunoglobulin. Read more about Kawasaki disease. Microscopic polyangiitis Microscopic polyangiitis is a rare and potentially serious long-term type of vasculitis that most often develops in middle-aged people. It can affect any organ, but particularly affects the lungs, kidneys and nerves. It can cause: a rash shortness of breath and coughing up blood red and sore eyes pins and needles or numbness kidney problems It''s usually treated with steroid medication or other medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system. The Vasculitis UK website has more information about microscopic polyangiitis. Polyarteritis nodosa Polyarteritis nodosa is a rare type of vasculitis that particularly affects the arteries supplying the gut, kidneys and nerves. It tends to develop in childhood or in middle-aged people. It can sometimes be triggered by an infection, such as hepatitis B, but the exact cause is uncertain. It can cause: muscle and joint pain tummy (abdominal) pain, particularly after eating a rash pins and needles or numbness bleeding and ulcers in the gut It can be very serious if not treated. The main treatment is steroid medication, and sometimes other medicines that reduce the activity of the immune system. The Vasculitis UK website has more information about polyarteritis nodosa. Polymyalgia rheumatica  Polymyalgia rheumatica is a type of vasculitis that''s closely related to giant cell arteritis (see above). It mostly occurs in adults over 50 and is more common in women than men. It can cause: pain and stiffness in the shoulders, neck and hips, which is often worse after waking up a high temperature (fever) extreme tiredness loss of appetite and weight loss depression The main treatment is steroid medication, which is usually used in lower doses than for giant cell arteritis.  Read more about polymyalgia rheumatica. Takayasu arteritis Takayasu arteritis is a type of vasculitis that mainly affects young women. It''s very rare in the UK.

In children with ASD, the symptoms are present before three years of age, although a diagnosis can sometimes be made after the age of three. It''s estimated that about 1 in every 100 people in the UK has ASD. More boys are diagnosed with the condition than girls. There''s no "cure" for ASD, but speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, educational support, plus a number of other interventions are available to help children and parents. Read about help and support available for people with ASD. Signs and symptoms People with ASD tend to have problems with social interaction and communication. In early infancy, some children with ASD don’t babble or use other vocal sounds. Older children have problems using non-verbal behaviours to interact with others – for example, they have difficulty with eye contact, facial expressions, body language and gestures. They may give no or brief eye contact and ignore familiar or unfamiliar people. Children with ASD may also lack awareness of and interest in other children. They’ll often either gravitate to older or younger children, rather than interacting with children of the same age. They tend to play alone. They can find it hard to understand other people''s emotions and feelings, and have difficulty starting conversations or taking part in them properly. Language development may be delayed, and a child with ASD won’t compensate their lack of language or delayed language skills by using gestures (body language) or facial expressions. Children with ASD will tend to repeat words or phrases spoken by others (either immediately or later) without formulating their own language, or in parallel to developing their language skills. Some children don’t demonstrate imaginative or pretend play, while others will continually repeat the same pretend play. Some children with ASD like to stick to the same routine and little changes may trigger tantrums. Some children may flap their hand or twist or flick their fingers when they’re excited or upset. Others may engage in repetitive activity, such as turning light switches on and off, opening and closing doors, or lining things up. Children and young people with ASD frequently experience a range of cognitive (thinking), learning, emotional and behavioural problems. For example, they may also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, or depression. About 70% of children with ASD have a non-verbal IQ below 70. Of these, 50% have a non-verbal IQ below 50. Overall, up to 50% of people with "severe learning difficulties" have an ASD. Read more about the symptoms of ASD. Getting a diagnosis The main features of ASD – problems with social communication and interaction – can often be recognised during early childhood. Some features of ASD may not become noticeable until a change of situation, such as when the child starts nursery or school. See your GP or health visitor if you notice any of the signs and symptoms of ASD in your child, or if you''re concerned about your child''s development. It can also be helpful to discuss your concerns with your child''s nursery or school. Read more about diagnosing ASD. Caring for someone with ASD Being a carer isn''t an easy role. When you''re busy responding to the needs of others, it can affect your emotional and physical energy, and make it easy to forget your own health and mental wellbeing. If you''re caring for someone else, it''s important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It''s in your best interests and those of the person you care for. Read more about care and support, including information on: carers'' assessments support and the benefits carers are entitled to carers'' breaks and respite care You can also call the Carers Direct helpline on 0300 123 1053. What causes ASD? The exact cause of ASD is unknown, but it''s thought that several complex genetic and environmental factors are involved. In the past, some people believed the MMR vaccine caused ASD, but this has been investigated extensively in a number of major studies around the world, involving millions of children, and researchers have found no evidence of a link between MMR and ASD. Read more about the causes of ASD. Autism in adults Some people with ASD had features of the condition as a child, but enter adulthood without ever being diagnosed. However, getting a diagnosis as an adult can often help a person with ASD and their families understand the condition, and work out what type of advice and support they need. For example, a number of autism-specific services are available that provide adults with ASD with the help and support they need to live independently and find a job that matches their skills and abilities.

It''s typically used to relieve mild or moderate pain, such as headaches, toothache or sprains, and reduce fevers caused by illnesses such as colds and flu. Paracetamol is often recommended as one of the first treatments for pain, as it''s safe for most people to take and side effects are rare. This page covers: Types of paracetamol Who can take it How to take it Taking it with other medicines, food and alcohol Side effects Overdoses and extra doses Types of paracetamol You can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription. Paracetamol is available as: tablets or caplets capsules liquid – usually for children soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink) suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage) an injection given into a vein – normally only used in hospital In some products, such as cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. It may be sold under the name paracetamol, or under various brand names (which may also contain other ingredients). Who can take paracetamol Most people can take paracetamol safely, including: pregnant women breastfeeding women children over two months of age – lower doses are recommended for young children (see How to take paracetamol below) If you''re not sure whether you can take paracetamol, check the leaflet that comes with it or ask your pharmacist or doctor for advice. Always get advice before taking paracetamol if you: have liver or kidney problems have problems with alcohol, such as long-term alcohol misuse are very underweight are taking other medications (see Interactions with other medicines below) Don''t take paracetamol if you''ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past. How to take paracetamol Make sure you take paracetamol as directed on the label or leaflet, or as instructed by a health professional. How much you can take depends on your age, your weight, the type of paracetamol you''re taking and how strong it is. For example: Adults can usually take one or two 500mg tablets every 4-6 hours, but shouldn''t take more than 4g (eight 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Children under 16 need to take a lower dose, depending on their age or weight – check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice. For very young children, paracetamol liquid is given using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe. Paracetamol should start to work within an hour and the effect usually lasts several hours. Don''t take more than the recommended dose if it isn''t relieving your symptoms. Adults can take ibuprofen at the same time if necessary, but this isn''t usually recommended for children. For more details, see Can I take paracetamol and ibuprofen together? Contact your GP or call NHS 111 if your symptoms get worse or last more than three days despite taking paracetamol. Be careful not to use other medications that contain paracetamol as an ingredient (such as some cold and flu remedies) while you''re taking paracetamol. Taking paracetamol with other medicines, food and alcohol Paracetamol can react unpredictably with certain other medications. This can affect how well either medicine works and might increase the risk of side effects. It may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as: other products containing paracetamol – including combination products where paracetamol is one of the ingredients carbamazepine – used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain colestyramine – used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease) imatinib and busulfan – used to treat certain types of cancer ketoconazole – a type of antifungal medicine lixisenatide – used to treat type 2 diabetes metoclopramide – used to relieve nausea and vomiting phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone – used to control seizures warfarin – used to prevent blood clots Check the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you''re not sure. There are no known problems caused by taking paracetamol with any specific foods or by drinking moderate amounts of alcohol while taking paracetamol. Side effects of paracetamol Side effects from paracetamol are rare but can include: an allergic reaction, which can cause a rash and swelling flushing, low blood pressure and a fast heartbeat – this can sometimes happen when paracetamol is given in hospital into a vein in your arm blood disorders, such as thrombocytopenia (low number of platelet cells) and leukopenia (low number of white blood cells) liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) – this can be fatal in severe cases Speak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any troublesome side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol. You can also report suspected side effects using the Yellow Card Scheme. Overdoses of paracetamol Taking too much paracetamol, known as an overdose, can be very dangerous. If you''ve taken more than the recommended maximum dose, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible. It can be helpful to take any remaining medicine and the box or leaflet with you to A&E if you can. Some people feel sick, vomit or have abdominal (tummy) pain after taking too much paracetamol, but often there are no obvious symptoms at first. Go to A&E even if you''re feeling well.

(406, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Rubella/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'Rubella', 'Rubella - NHS Choices', 'Rubella  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Rubella (german measles) is a viral infection that''s now rare in the UK. It''s usually a mild condition that gets better without treatment in 7 to 10 days. Symptoms of rubella include: a red-pink skin rash made up of small spots swollen glands around the head and neck a high temperature (fever) cold-like symptoms such as a cough and runny nose aching and painful joints – more common in adults The symptoms of rubella usually only last a few days, but your glands may be swollen for several weeks. Read more about the symptoms of rubella. When to see your GP You should always contact your GP or NHS 111 if you suspect rubella. Don''t visit your GP surgery without phoning first, as arrangements may need to be made to reduce the risk of infecting others. If you''re pregnant and develop a rash or come into contact with someone who has a rash, contact your GP or midwife immediately. Read more about diagnosing rubella. Rubella and pregnancy Rubella usually only becomes a serious concern if a pregnant woman catches the infection during the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy. This is because the rubella virus can disrupt the development of the baby and cause a wide range of health problems, including: eye problems – such as cataracts (cloudy patches on the lens of the eye) deafness heart abnormalities brain damage The birth defects caused by the rubella virus are known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Since the introduction of the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine, CRS is now very rare in the UK. Read more about the complications of rubella. How it spreads Rubella is caused by a type of virus called a togavirus. It''s spread in a similar way to a cold or flu, through droplets of moisture from the nose or throat of someone who''s infected. These droplets are released into the air when someone coughs, sneezes or talks. You can become infected if you come into contact with the droplets from an infected person, although it can take two to three weeks for symptoms to develop. If you have rubella, you''ll be infectious to other people from one week before symptoms develop, and for up to four days after the rash first appeared. You should stay away from school or work for four days after the rash starts to avoid infecting others, and try to avoid contact with pregnant women during this time. Who''s affected? Rubella is rare in the UK nowadays. Most cases occur in people who came to the UK from countries that don''t offer routine immunisation against rubella. However, there can occasionally be large outbreaks of rubella in the UK. One of these occurred in 1996, when there were almost 4,000 cases in England and Wales. There were 12 confirmed cases of rubella in England and Wales in 2013. Treating rubella There''s no specific treatment for rubella, but symptoms normally pass within 7 to 10 days. If you or your child are finding the symptoms uncomfortable, you can treat some of these at home while you wait for the infection to pass. For example, paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to reduce the fever and treat any aches or pains. Liquid infant paracetamol can be used for young children. Aspirin shouldn''t be given to children under the age of 16 years. Read more about treating rubella. Preventing rubella The best way to prevent rubella is to be immunised with the MMR vaccine. Children are offered this vaccine as part of the routine childhood immunisation programme. It''s given in two doses – the first when the child is one year old, followed by a second booster dose before they start school, at three years and four months. Routine vaccination is important because it reduces the risk of large outbreaks and helps protect pregnant women and their babies. The MMR vaccine can also be given to older children and adults who haven''t been fully immunised before. Contact your GP if you''re uncertain whether you or your child are up-to-date with vaccinations. If you''re thinking of getting pregnant and you''re not sure whether you''ve had two doses of the MMR vaccine, it''s a good idea to check with your GP practice. If your records show you haven''t had two doses of MMR or there''s no record, ask for the vaccinations. Read more about preventing rubella. Information about you If you or your child has rubella, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register.

(407, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/red-eye/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'red eyes', 'Red eye - NHS Choices', 'Red eye  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', '  A red eye can be alarming, but is often just a sign of a minor eye condition, such as conjunctivitis or a burst blood vessel. If it''s painful, there may be a more serious problem.  See your GP for advice if your red eye doesn''t start to improve after a few days. Contact your GP or NHS 111 immediately, or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department, if: you have a painful red eye you have other symptoms, including reduced vision, sensitivity to light, a severe headache and feeling sick you recently injured your eye – particularly if something has pierced your eye This page aims to give you a better idea of what might be causing your red eye. However, it shouldn''t be used to self-diagnose your condition. Always see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment. Common causes of a painless red eye The most likely causes of a painless red eye are minor problems such as conjunctivitis or a burst blood vessel. These conditions don''t tend to affect your vision and normally get better within a week or two. Conjunctivitis Conjunctivitis is inflammation (swelling and irritation) of the conjunctiva – the thin layer of tissue covering the eyeball and inner surfaces of the eyelids. This causes the blood vessels on the eye to swell, making one or both eyes look bloodshot and feel gritty. Other symptoms can include itchiness and watering of the eyes, and a sticky coating on the eyelashes. Conjunctivitis can be caused by an infection, an allergy (for example, to pollen), or an irritant, such as chlorine or dust. Treatment will depend on what is causing the condition. Sometimes no treatment is needed, because it may get better on its own.  Your doctor may recommend: regularly cleaning away any crusting or discharge not wearing contact lenses until the condition passes washing your hands regularly and avoiding sharing pillows or towels to help prevent the condition spreading to others (if it''s infectious) antibiotic eye drops for bacterial infections or medications, such as antihistamines for allergies Read more about treating conjunctivitis. Burst blood vessel in the eye Straining, coughing or injuring your eye can sometimes cause a blood vessel to burst on the eye surface, causing a bright red blotch. This is called a subconjunctival haemorrhage. It can look alarming, especially if you''re taking medication such as aspirin or warfarin (these reduce the blood''s ability to clot, which can exaggerate the redness), but it''s not usually serious and should clear up on its own within a few weeks. Common causes of a painful red eye If your red eye is painful or you have other symptoms such as reduced vision, the cause is likely to be one of the below conditions. These conditions can sometimes be serious and could threaten your sight, so they should be assessed by a doctor as soon as possible. Iritis  Iritis is inflammation of the iris (the coloured part of the eye). It''s also known as anterior uveitis. As well as a red eye, you may notice that your eye is sensitive to light, your vision is blurred and you have a headache. Often, no cause is identified, although iritis can sometimes be caused by an underlying problem with the immune system or an infection. Iritis usually responds quickly to treatment with steroid medication to reduce the inflammation. It rarely leads to severe problems. Acute glaucoma Acute glaucoma is a serious condition where there is a sudden increase in pressure inside your eye. Your eye will probably be severely red and painful, and you may feel sick and see halos around lights. Your vision may be blurred or cloudy. If your GP thinks you may have acute glaucoma, they will refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) immediately, because the condition could potentially lead to permanent loss of vision if it''s not treated quickly. Corneal ulcer (ulcer on the cornea) An ulcer on the cornea (the clear outer layer at the front of the eyeball) is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection. It can cause the eye to become red and sensitive to light, and it can feel like there''s something in your eye. Bacterial corneal ulcers are usually seen in people who wear contact lenses. Viral corneal ulcers are often seen in people who frequently get cold sores. If your GP thinks you have a corneal ulcer, they will refer you to an eye specialist for treatment. A scratch to the cornea or particle in the eye A red and painful eye can sometimes be caused by a particle, such as a piece of grit, getting in your eye. If there''s something in your eye, your GP or a hospital doctor at an accident and emergency (A&E) department will try to remove it. They will first put anaesthetic eye drops into your eye to numb it and reduce any pain. If the particle has scratched your eye, it may feel a bit uncomfortable when the anaesthetic eye drops have worn off. You may be given antibiotic eye drops or ointment to use for a few days to reduce the risk of infection while it heals. Read more about eye injuries.

(408, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/dehydration/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'dehydration', 'Dehydration - NHS Choices', 'Dehydration  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Introduction  Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid than you take in. When the normal water content of your body is reduced, it upsets the balance of minerals (salts and sugar) in your body, which affects the way it functions. Water makes up over two-thirds of the healthy human body. It lubricates the joints and eyes, aids digestion, flushes out waste and toxins, and keeps the skin healthy. Some of the early warning signs of dehydration include: feeling thirsty and lightheaded a dry mouth tiredness having dark coloured, strong-smelling urine passing urine less often than usual A baby may be dehydrated if they: have a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head have few or no tears when they cry have fewer wet nappies are drowsy The body is affected even when you lose a small amount of fluid. Read more about the symptoms of dehydration. What causes dehydration? Dehydration is usually caused by not drinking enough fluid to replace what we lose. The climate, the amount of physical exercise you are doing (particularly in hot weather) and your diet can contribute to dehydration. You can also become dehydrated as a result of an illness, such as persistent vomiting and diarrhoea, or sweating from a fever. Read more about the causes of dehydration. Who is at risk from dehydration? Anyone can become dehydrated, but certain groups are particularly at risk. These include: babies and infants – they have a low body weight and are sensitive to even small amounts of fluid loss older people – they may be less aware that they are becoming dehydrated and need to keep drinking fluids people with a long-term health condition – such as diabetes or alcoholism athletes – they can lose a large amount of body fluid through sweat when exercising for long periods  What to do If you''re dehydrated, drink plenty of fluids such as water, diluted squash or fruit juice. These are much more effective than large amounts of tea or coffee. Fizzy drinks may contain more sugar than you need and may be harder to take in large amounts. If you''re finding it difficult to keep water down because you''re vomiting, try drinking small amounts more frequently. Infants and small children who are dehydrated shouldn''t be given large amounts of water alone as the main replacement fluid. This is because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body too much and lead to other problems. Instead, they should be given diluted squash or a rehydration solution (available from pharmacies). You might find a teaspoon or syringe can be helpful for getting fluid into a young child. If left untreated, severe dehydration can be serious and cause fits (seizures), brain damage and death. Read more about treating dehydration. When to see your GP See your GP if your symptoms continue, despite drinking plenty of fluids, or if you think your baby or toddler is dehydrated. If your GP suspects dehydration, you may have a blood test or a urine test to check the balance of salts (sodium and potassium) in your body. Contact your GP, out-of-hours service or NHS 111 straight away if you have any of the following symptoms: extreme thirst feeling unusually tired (lethargic) or confused not passing urine for eight hours rapid heartbeat dizziness when you stand up that doesn''t go away after a few seconds You should also contact your GP if your baby has had six or more episodes of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours, or if they have vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours.  How much should I drink? Studies have tried to establish a recommended daily fluid intake, but it can vary depending on the individual and factors such as age, climate and physical activity. A good rule is to drink enough fluid so that you''re not thirsty for long periods, and to steadily increase your fluid intake when exercising and during hot weather. Passing clear urine (wee) is a good sign that you''re well hydrated. You should drink plenty of fluid if you have symptoms of dehydration, such as feeling thirsty and lightheaded, or passing dark-coloured urine. It is also important to replace fluid lost after an episode of diarrhoea.  Page last reviewed: 13/04/2015 Next review due: 01/04/2018', -290361331),

(410, 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pneumonia/Pages/Introduction.aspx', '(pneumonia)', 'Pneumonia - NHS Choices', 'Pneumonia  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', '  Pneumonia is swelling (inflammation) of the tissue in one or both lungs. It''s usually caused by a bacterial infection. At the end of the breathing tubes in your lungs are clusters of tiny air sacs. If you have pneumonia, these tiny sacs become inflamed and fill up with fluid. Symptoms of pneumonia The symptoms of pneumonia can develop suddenly over 24 to 48 hours, or they may come on more slowly over several days. Common symptoms of pneumonia include: a cough – which may be dry, or produce thick yellow, green, brown or blood-stained mucus (phlegm) difficulty breathing – your breathing may be rapid and shallow, and you may feel breathless, even when resting rapid heartbeat fever feeling generally unwell sweating and shivering loss of appetite chest pain – which gets worse when breathing or coughing Less common symptoms include: coughing up blood (haemoptysis) headaches fatigue nausea or vomiting wheezing joint and muscle pain feeling confused and disorientated, particularly in elderly people When to see your GP See your GP if you feel unwell and you have typical symptoms of pneumonia. Seek urgent medical attention if you''re experiencing severe symptoms, such as rapid breathing, chest pain or confusion. Who''s affected? In the UK, pneumonia affects around 8 in 1,000 adults each year. It''s more widespread in autumn and winter. Pneumonia can affect people of any age, but it''s more common – and can be more serious – in certain groups of people, such as the very young or the elderly. People in these groups are more likely to need hospital treatment if they develop pneumonia. What causes pneumonia? Pneumonia is usually the result of a pneumococcal infection, caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. Many different types of bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, can also cause pneumonia, as well as viruses and, more rarely, fungi. As well as bacterial pneumonia, other types include: viral pneumonia – most commonly caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and sometimes influenza type A or B; viruses are a common cause of pneumonia in young children aspiration pneumonia – caused by breathing in vomit, a foreign object, such as a peanut, or a harmful substance, such as smoke or a chemical fungal pneumonia – rare in the UK and more likely to affect people with a weakened immune system hospital-acquired pneumonia – pneumonia that develops in hospital while being treated for another condition or having an operation; people in intensive care on breathing machines are particularly at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia Risk groups The following groups have an increased risk of developing pneumonia: babies and very young children elderly people people who smoke people with other health conditions, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, or a heart, kidney or liver condition people with a weakened immune system – for example, as a result of a recent illness, such as flu, having HIV or AIDS, having chemotherapy, or taking medication following an organ transplant Diagnosing pneumonia Your GP may be able to diagnose pneumonia by asking about your symptoms and examining your chest. Further tests may be needed in some cases. Pneumonia can be difficult to diagnose because it shares many symptoms with other conditions, such as the common cold, bronchitis and asthma. To help make a diagnosis, your GP may ask you: whether you feel breathless or you''re breathing faster than usual how long you''ve had your cough, and whether you''re coughing up mucus and what colour it is if the pain in your chest is worse when you breathe in or out Your GP may also take your temperature and listen to your chest and back with a stethoscope to check for any crackling or rattling sounds. They may also listen to your chest by tapping it. Lungs filled with fluid produce a different sound from normal healthy lungs. If you have mild pneumonia, you probably won''t need to have a chest X-ray or any other tests. You may need a chest X-ray or other tests, such as a sputum (mucus) test or blood tests, if your symptoms haven''t improved within 48 hours of starting treatment. Treating pneumonia Mild pneumonia can usually be treated at home by: getting plenty of rest taking antibiotics drinking plenty of fluids If you don''t have any other health problems, you should respond well to treatment and soon recover, although your cough may last for some time. As pneumonia isn''t usually passed from one person to another, it''s safe to be around others, including family members. However, people with a weakened immune system should avoid close contact with a person with pneumonia until they start to get better. For at-risk groups, pneumonia can be severe and may need to be treated in hospital. This is because it can lead to serious complications, which in some cases can be fatal, depending on a person''s health and age. Read more about treating pneumonia. Complications of pneumonia Complications of pneumonia are more common in young children, the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions, such as diabetes. Possible complications of pneumonia include: pleurisy – where the thin linings between your lungs and ribcage (pleura) become inflamed, which can lead to respiratory failure a lung abscess – a rare complication that''s mostly seen in people with a serious pre-existing illness or a history of severe alcohol misuse blood poisoning (septicaemia) – also a rare but serious complication You''ll be admitted to hospital for treatment if you develop one of these complications. Preventing pneumonia Although most cases of pneumonia are bacterial and aren''t passed on from one person to another, ensuring good standards of hygiene will help prevent germs spreading. For example, you should: cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or tissue when you cough or sneeze  throw away used tissues immediately – germs can live for several hours after they leave your nose or mouth wash your hands regularly to avoid transferring germs to other people or objects A healthy lifestyle can also help prevent pneumonia. For example, you should avoid smoking as it damages your lungs and increases the chance of infection. Find out how to stop smoking. Excessive and prolonged alcohol misuse also weakens your lungs'' natural defences against infections, making you more vulnerable to pneumonia. People at high risk of pneumonia should be offered the pneumococcal vaccine and flu vaccine. Page last reviewed: 11/05/2016 Next review due: 01/05/2019', 567003918),

If the MMR vaccine isn''t suitable for you, a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) can be used if you''re at immediate risk of catching measles. MMR vaccine Routine vaccination The MMR vaccine is given as part of the routine NHS childhood vaccination programme. One dose is usually given to a child when they''re 12-13 months old and a second dose is given before they start school, usually between three and five years old. Contact your GP if you are uncertain about whether your child''s vaccinations are up-to-date. You or your child can be vaccinated at any point if you haven''t been fully vaccinated before. If you''re not sure whether you were vaccinated in the past, having the vaccine again won''t cause any harm. Special circumstances A dose of the MMR vaccine can also be given to anyone over six months of age if they''re at an immediate risk of catching measles. For example, this could be if: there''s an outbreak of measles in your local area you''ve been in close contact with someone who has measles you''re planning on travelling to an area where the infection is widespread Children who have the vaccine before their first birthday should still have the two routine doses at around 13 months of age and before they start school. Human normal immunoglobulin Human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) is a special concentration of antibodies that can give short-term but immediate protection against measles. It may be recommended for people in the following groups if they''ve been exposed to someone with measles: babies under six months of age pregnant women who haven''t been fully vaccinated or haven''t had measles before people with weak immune systems – for example, those with HIV or people receiving treatment that weakens their immune system, such as treatment for leukaemia HNIG should ideally be given within six days of exposure. Stopping measles spreading to others If you already have measles, it''s important to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to other people. You should: avoid work or school for at least four days from when you first developed the measles rash try to avoid contact with people who are more vulnerable to the infection, such as young children and pregnant women, while you''re ill Page last reviewed: 11/09/2015 Next review due: 01/09/2018', -784178542),

If the cut is to your hand or arm, raise it above your head to help reduce the flow of blood. If the injury is to a lower limb, lie down and raise the affected area above the level of your heart. Clean the wound and apply a dressing When the wound has stopped bleeding, clean it and cover it with a dressing to help stop it becoming infected. To do this: wash and dry your hands thoroughly clean the wound under drinking-quality running tap water – avoid using antiseptic as it may damage the skin and slow healing pat the area dry with a clean towel apply a sterile adhesive dressing, such as a plaster – read more about how to apply plasters and other dressings Keep the dressing clean by changing it as often as necessary. Keep the wound dry by using waterproof dressings, which will allow you to take showers. You can remove the dressing after a few days, once the wound has closed itself. Take painkillers if needed If the wound is painful for the first few days, you can take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. When to get medical help Call NHS 111 or visit your local walk-in centre, minor injuries unit or GP surgery if there''s a risk your wound could become infected, or you think it''s already infected. A wound is at risk of infection if: it has been contaminated with dirt, pus or other bodily fluids there was something in the wound before it was cleaned, such as gravel or a shard of glass it has a jagged edge it''s longer than 5cm (2 inches) it was caused by an animal or human bite Signs a wound has become infected include: swelling, redness and increasing pain in the affected area pus forming in or around the wound feeling generally unwell a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above swollen glands under the chin or in the neck, armpits or groin An infected wound can usually be successfully treated with a short course of antibiotics.

This is followed a few days later by the measles rash. For most people, the illness lasts around 7 to 10 days in total. Initial symptoms The initial symptoms of measles can include: a runny or blocked nose sneezing watery eyes swollen eyelids sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40C (104F) small greyish-white spots in the mouth (see below) aches and pains a cough loss of appetite tiredness, irritability and a general lack of energy Spots in the mouth A day or two before the rash appears, many people with measles develop small greyish-white spots in their mouth. Not everyone with measles has these spots, but if someone has them in addition to the other symptoms listed above or a rash, it''s highly likely they have the condition.

Many deaths could be prevented if first aid is given before emergency services arrive. What to do If someone is injured you should: first check that you and the casualty aren''t in any danger, and, if possible, make the situation safe if necessary, dial 999 or 112 for an ambulance when it''s safe to do so carry out basic first aid Read more about what to do after an incident. If someone is unconscious and breathing If a person is unconscious but breathing, and has no other injuries that would stop them being moved, place them in the recovery position until help arrives. Keep them under observation to ensure they continue to breathe normally, and don''t obstruct their airway. If someone is unconscious and not breathing If a person isn''t breathing normally after an incident, call an ambulance and start CPR straight away. Use hands-only CPR if you aren''t trained to perform rescue breaths. Read more about CPR, including instructions and a video about hands-only CPR. Common accidents and emergencies Below, in alphabetical order, are some of the most common injuries that need emergency treatment in the UK and information about how to deal with them: anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) bleeding burns and scalds   choking  drowning  electric shock (domestic)  fractures  heart attack  poisoning  shock  stroke Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic shock) is a severe allergic reaction that can occur after an insect sting or after eating certain foods. The adverse reaction can be very fast, occurring within seconds or minutes of coming into contact with the substance the person is allergic to (allergen). During anaphylactic shock, it may be difficult for the person to breathe, as their tongue and throat may swell, obstructing their airway. Call 999 or 112 immediately if you think someone is experiencing anaphylactic shock. Check if the person is carrying any medication. Some people who know they have severe allergies may carry an adrenaline self-injector, which is a type of pre-loaded syringe. You can either help the person administer their medication or, if you''re trained to do so, give it to them yourself. After the injection, continue to look after the person until medical help arrives. All casualties who have had an intramuscular or subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of adrenaline must be seen and medically checked by a healthcare professional as soon as possible after the injection has been given. Make sure they''re comfortable and can breathe as best they can while waiting for medical help to arrive. If they''re conscious, sitting upright is normally the best position for them. Read more about treating anaphylaxis. Bleeding If someone is bleeding heavily, the main aim is to prevent further blood loss and minimise the effects of shock (see below). First, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible. If you have disposable gloves, use them to reduce the risk of any infection being passed on. Check that there''s nothing embedded in the wound. If there is, take care not to press down on the object. Instead, press firmly on either side of the object and build up padding around it before bandaging, to avoid putting pressure on the object itself. If nothing is embedded: apply and maintain pressure to the wound with your gloved hand, using a clean pad or dressing if possible; continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops  use a clean dressing to bandage the wound firmly if bleeding continues through the pad, apply pressure to the wound  until the bleeding stops and then apply another pad over the top and bandage it in place; don''t remove the original pad or dressing, but continue to check that the bleeding has stopped  If a body part, such as a finger, has been severed, place it in a plastic bag or wrap it in cling film and make sure it goes with the casualty to hospital. Always seek medical help for bleeding unless it''s minor. If someone has a nosebleed that hasn''t stopped after 20 minutes, go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department. Read more about how to treat minor bleeding from cuts and grazes and how to treat nosebleeds. Haemostatic dressings and tourniquets In certain situations, where bleeding is very severe and from the body’s extremities, such as the head, neck and torso, it may be appropriate to use haemostatic dressings or a tourniquet. Haemostatic dressings contain properties that help the blood to clot (thicken) quicker. A tourniquet is a band that''s wrapped tightly around a limb to stop blood loss. Haemostatic dressings and tourniquets should only be used by people who have been trained to apply them. Burns and scalds If someone has a burn or scald: cool the burn as quickly as possible with cool running water for at least 20 minutes, or until the pain is relieved call 999 or seek medical help, if needed while cooling the burn, carefully remove any clothing or jewellery, unless it''s attached to the skin if you''re cooling a large burnt area, particularly in babies, children and elderly people, be aware that it may cause hypothermia (it may be necessary to stop cooling the burn to avoid hypothermia)  cover the burn loosely with cling film; if cling film isn''t available, use a clean, dry dressing or non-fluffy material; don''t wrap the burn tightly, because swelling may lead to further injury don''t apply creams, lotions or sprays to the burn For chemical burns, wear protective gloves, remove any affected clothing, and rinse the burn with cool running water for at least 20 minutes to wash out the chemical. If possible, determine the cause of the injury. In certain situations where a chemical is regularly handled, a specific chemical antidote may be available to use. Be careful not to contaminate and injure yourself with the chemical, and wear protective clothing if necessary. Call 999 or 112 for immediate medical help. Read more about how to treat burns and scalds. Choking The information below is for choking in adults and children over one year old. Read what to do if a baby under one year old is choking. Mild choking If the airway is only partly blocked, the person will usually be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe. In situations like this, a person will usually be able to clear the blockage themselves. If choking is mild: encourage the person to cough to try to clear the blockage ask them to try to spit out the object if it’s in their mouth don''t put your fingers in their mouth to help them because they may accidentally bite you If coughing doesn’t work, start back blows (see below). Severe choking  If choking is severe, the person won’t be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe, and without help they’ll eventually become unconscious. To help an adult or child over one year old: Stand behind the person and slightly to one side. Support their chest with one hand. Lean the person forward so that the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down. Give up to five sharp blows between the person’s shoulder blades with the heel of your hand (the heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist). Check if the blockage has cleared. If not, give up to five abdominal thrusts (see below). Abdominal thrusts shouldn''t be used on babies under one year old, pregnant women or obese people. To perform abdominal thrusts on a person who is severely choking and isn’t in one of the above groups: Stand behind the person who is choking. Place your arms around their waist and bend them well forward. Clench one fist and place it just above the person''s belly button. Place your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards. Repeat this up to five times. The aim is to get the obstruction out with each chest thrust, rather than necessarily doing all five. If the obstruction doesn''t clear after three cycles of back blows and chest thrusts, dial 999 or 112 to ask for an ambulance, and continue until help arrives. The person choking should always be seen by a healthcare professional afterwards to check for any injuries or small pieces of the obstruction that remain. Drowning If someone is in difficulty in water, don''t enter the water to help unless it''s absolutely essential. Once the person is on land, if they''re not breathing, open the airway and give five initial rescue breaths before starting CPR. If you''re alone, perform CPR for one minute before calling for emergency help. Find out how to give CPR, including rescue breaths. If the person is unconscious but still breathing, put them into the recovery position with their head lower than their body and call an ambulance immediately. Continue to observe the casualty to ensure they don''t stop breathing or that their airway becomes obstructed. Electric shock (domestic) If someone has had an electric shock, switch off the electrical current at the mains to break the contact between the person and the electrical supply. If you can''t reach the mains supply: don''t go near or touch the person until you''re sure the electrical supply has been switched off   once the power supply has been switched off, and if the person isn''t breathing, dial 999 or 112 to for an ambulance Afterwards, seek medical help - unless the electric shock is very minor. Fractures It can be difficult to tell if a person has a broken bone or a joint, as opposed to a simple muscular injury. If you''re in any doubt, treat the injury as a broken bone. If the person is unconscious, has difficulty breathing or is bleeding severely, these must be dealt with first, by controlling the bleeding with direct pressure and performing CPR. If the person is conscious, prevent any further pain or damage by keeping the fracture as still as possible until you get them safely to hospital. Assess the injury and decide whether the best way to get them to hospital is by ambulance or car. For example, if the pain isn’t too severe, you could transport them to hospital by car. It''s always best to get someone else to drive, so that you can deal with the casualty if they deteriorate – for example, if they lose consciousness as a result of the pain or start to vomit. However, if: they’re in a lot of pain and in need of strong painkilling medication, don''t move them and call an ambulance it''s obvious they have a broken leg, don''t move them, but keep them in the position you found them in and call an ambulance you suspect they have injured or broken their back, don''t move them and call an ambulance Don''t give the casualty anything to eat or drink, because they may need an anaesthetic (numbing medication) when they reach hospital. You can read more about specific broken bones in the following pages:  broken ankle broken arm or wrist broken collarbone broken nose broken toe fractured ribs hip fracture Heart attack A heart attack is one of the most common life-threatening heart conditions in the UK. If you think a person is having, or has had, a heart attack, sit them down and make them as comfortable as possible, and call 999 or 112 for an ambulance. Symptoms of a heart attack include: chest pain – the pain is usually located in the centre or left side of the chest and can feel like a sensation of pressure, tightness or squeezing pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is travelling from the chest down one or both arms, or into the jaw, neck, back or abdomen (tummy)  Sit the person down and make them comfortable. If they''re conscious, reassure them and ask them to take a 300mg aspirin tablet to chew slowly (unless you know they shouldn''t take aspirin – for example, if they''re under 16 or allergic to it). If the person has any medication for angina, such as a spray or tablets, help them to take it. Monitor their vital signs, such as breathing, until help arrives. If the person deteriorates and becomes unconscious, open their airway, check their breathing and, if necessary, start CPR. Re-alert the emergency services that the casualty is now in cardiac arrest. Poisoning Poisoning is potentially life-threatening. Most cases of poisoning in the UK happen when a person has swallowed a toxic substance, such as bleach, taken an overdose of a prescription medication, or eaten wild plants and fungi. Alcohol poisoning can cause similar symptoms. If you think someone has swallowed a poisonous substance, call 999 or 112 to get immediate medical help and advice. The effects of poisoning depend on the substance swallowed, but can include vomiting, loss of consciousness, pain or a burning sensation. The following advice is important: Find out what''s been swallowed, so you can tell the paramedic or doctor. Do not give the person anything to eat or drink unless a healthcare professional advises you to. Do not try to cause vomiting. Stay with the person, because their condition may get worse and they could become unconscious. If the person becomes unconscious while you''re waiting for help to arrive, check for breathing and, if necessary, perform CPR. Don''t perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the casualty''s mouth or airway is contaminated with the poison. Don''t leave them if they''re unconscious because they may roll onto their back, which could cause them to vomit. The vomit could then enter their lungs and make them choke. If the casualty is conscious and breathing normally, put them into the recovery position and continue to monitor their conscious state and breathing. Read more about treating someone who''s been poisoned and treating alcohol poisoning. Shock In the case of a serious injury or illness, it''s important to look out for signs of shock (see below). Shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the circulatory system fails to provide enough oxygenated blood to the body and, as a result, deprives the vital organs of oxygen. This is usually due to severe blood loss, but it can also occur after severe burns, severe vomiting, a heart attack, bacterial infection or a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). The type of shock described here isn''t the same as the emotional response of feeling shocked, which can also occur after an accident. Signs of shock include: pale, cold, clammy skin sweating rapid, shallow breathing weakness and dizziness feeling sick and possibly vomiting thirst yawning sighing Seek medical help immediately if you notice that someone has any of the above signs of shock. If they do, you should: dial 999 or 112 as soon as possible and ask for an ambulance treat any obvious injuries lie the person down if their injuries allow you to and, if possible, raise and support their legs use a coat or blanket to keep them warm don''t give them anything to eat or drink give them lots of comfort and reassurance monitor the person – if they stop breathing, start CPR and re-alert the emergency services Stroke The FAST guide is the most important thing to remember when dealing with people who have had a stroke. The earlier they receive treatment, the better. Call for emergency medical help straight away. If you think a person has had a stroke, use the FAST guide: Facial weakness – is the person unable to smile evenly, or are their eyes or mouth droopy? Arm weakness – is the person only able to raise one arm? Speech problems – is the person unable to speak clearly or understand you? Time to call 999 or 112 – for emergency help if a person has any of these symptoms Read more about the symptoms of a stroke. Getting help in an emergency In the UK, 999 has been the emergency services number for many years. However, you can now also call 112 to get help, which is the single emergency telephone number for the EU. This number will give you access to the emergency services wherever you are in the EU. When you call 999 or 112, you''ll be asked what service you need, as well as: your telephone number the address you''re calling from  a brief description of what''s wrong with the casualty and whether they''re bleeding, unconscious or not breathing The call handler may advise you on how to assist the casualty until help arrives.

It usually begins with flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, headache and joint pain. More serious symptoms may then develop over the next few hours or days, including: changes in mental state, such as confusion, drowsiness or disorientation seizures (fits) changes in personality and behaviour Flu-like symptoms that rapidly get worse and affect mental state should be treated as a medical emergency. Dial 999 immediately to request an ambulance. Read more about the symptoms of encephalitis. What causes encephalitis? There are several different types of encephalitis and each type has a different cause. The most common types of encephalitis are: infectious – inflammation occurs as a direct result of an infection, which is often viral post-infectious – inflammation is caused by the immune system reacting to a previous infection, and can occur days, weeks or months after the initial infection autoimmune – inflammation is caused by the immune system reacting to a non-infectious cause, such as a tumour   chronic – inflammation develops slowly over many months and can be due to a condition such as HIV; in some cases, there''s no obvious cause There are also several types of encephalitis spread by mosquitoes, such as Japanese encephalitis, and ticks, such as tick-borne encephalitis. Encephalitis can also be caused by rabies. Read more about the causes of encephalitis. In the UK, all types of encephalitis are relatively rare. The Encephalitis Society estimates that there are 4,000 case of encephalitis in the UK each year. Anyone can be affected by encephalitis, but the very young and the very old are most at risk, because their immune systems tend to be weaker. Treating encephalitis Encephalitis needs urgent treatment, usually in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU). The earlier it''s diagnosed, the more successful treatment is. Treatment depends on the type of encephalitis you have, but may include: anti-viral medication steroid injections immunosuppressants (medicines that stop the immune system attacking healthy tissue) Read more about diagnosing encephalitis and treating encephalitis. Complications Some people make a full recovery after having encephalitis. However, for many it can lead to permanent brain damage and complications, including: memory loss  epilepsy personality and behavioural changes problems with attention, concentration, planning and problem solving   fatigue (extreme tiredness) Overall, about 10% of encephalitis cases are fatal. Read more about the complications of encephalitis. Preventing encephalitis It''s not always possible to prevent encephalitis. This is because it can be a rare complication of a relatively common infection. The most effective way to reduce your risk of getting encephalitis is to ensure you have the MMR vaccine (for measles, mumps and rubella). Practicing good hygiene – for example, regularly washing your hands with soap and warm water can help to reduce your risk of developing common infections. Other vaccinations Vaccinations are also available for Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis and encephalitis caused by rabies. These types of encephalitis are rare in the UK, but more widespread in certain parts of the world. For example, rabies tends to be more common in Africa, Japanese encephalitis is more common in Asia, and the risk areas for tick-borne encephalitis are the forests of central, eastern and northern Europe. You should discuss these specific vaccinations with your GP before travelling. Read more about the Japanese encephalitis vaccination, preventing tick-borne encephalitis and the rabies vaccination.

(419, 'http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Psoriasis/Pages/Symptoms.aspx', 'psoriasis', 'Psoriasis - Symptoms - NHS Choices', 'Psoriasis - Symptoms  Share: Save: Print: Print this page', 'Symptoms of psoriasis  Psoriasis typically causes patches of skin that are dry, red and covered in silver scales. Some people find their psoriasis causes itching or soreness. There are several different types of psoriasis. Many people have only one form of psoriasis at a time, although two different types can occur together. One type may change into another type, or become more severe. Most cases of psoriasis go through cycles, causing problems for a few weeks or months before easing or stopping. You should see your GP if you think you may have psoriasis. Common types of psoriasis Plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris) This is the most common form, accounting for about 80% of cases. Its symptoms are dry, red skin lesions, known as plaques, which are covered in silver scales. They normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. The plaques can be itchy, sore or both. In severe cases, the skin around your joints may crack and bleed.  Scalp psoriasis This can occur on parts of your scalp or on the whole scalp. It causes red patches of skin covered in thick silvery-white scales. Some people find scalp psoriasis extremely itchy, while others have no discomfort. In extreme cases it can cause hair loss, although this is usually only temporary. Nail psoriasis In about half of all people with psoriasis, the condition affects the nails. Psoriasis can cause your nails to develop tiny dents or pits, become discoloured, or grow abnormally. Nails can often become loose and separate from your nail bed. In severe cases, your nails may crumble. Guttate psoriasis Guttate psoriasis causes small (less than 1cm or 1/3 inch) drop-shaped sores on your chest, arms, legs and scalp. There''s a good chance that guttate psoriasis will disappear completely after a few weeks, but some people go on to develop plaque psoriasis. This type of psoriasis sometimes occurs after a streptococcal throat infection and is more common among children and teenagers. Inverse (flexural) psoriasis This affects folds or creases in your skin, such as the armpits, groin, between the buttocks and under the breasts. It can cause large, smooth red patches in some or all of these areas. Inverse psoriasis is made worse by friction and sweating, so it can be particularly uncomfortable in hot weather. Pustular psoriasis Pustular psoriasis is a rarer type of psoriasis that causes pus-filled blisters (pustules) to appear on your skin. Different types of pustular psoriasis affect different parts of the body. Generalised pustular psoriasis or von Zumbusch psoriasis This causes pustules on a wide area of skin, which develop very quickly. The pus consists of white blood cells and is not a sign of infection. The pustules may reappear every few days or weeks in cycles. During the start of these cycles, von Zumbusch psoriasis can cause fever, chills, weight loss and fatigue. Palmoplantar pustular psoriasis This causes pustules to appear on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. The pustules gradually develop into circular brown, scaly spots, which then peel off. Pustules may reappear every few days or weeks. Acropustulosis This causes pustules to appear on your fingers and toes. The pustules then burst, leaving bright red areas that may ooze or become scaly. These may lead to painful nail deformities. Erythrodermic psoriasis Erythrodermic psoriasis is a rare form of psoriasis that affects nearly all the skin on the body. This can cause intense itching or burning. Erythrodermic psoriasis can cause your body to lose proteins and fluid, leading to further problems such as infection, dehydration, heart failure, hypothermia and malnutrition. Want to know more?

It''s often caused by your immune system attacking healthy body tissue. In most cases, glomerulonephritis doesn''t cause any noticeable symptoms and is often diagnosed when blood or urine tests are carried out for another reason. In severe cases, glomerulonephritis may cause visible blood in your urine or your urine may become frothy. Swelling of the legs or other parts of the body (oedema) can also develop. Having blood in your urine doesn''t mean that you definitely have glomerulonephritis, but you should see your GP so the cause can be investigated. Read more about the symptoms of glomerulonephritis and diagnosing glomerulonephritis. Why does glomerulonephritis happen? Glomerulonephritis is usually the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack healthy tissue in the kidneys. However, there are many cases where the exact cause is unknown. It can occur by itself or be part of a more general condition, such as vasculitis or lupus. Glomerulonephritis is sometimes short-lived (acute), but often lasts for a long time (chronic). Read more about the causes of glomerulonephritis.  How is glomerulonephritis treated? The recommended treatment will depend on the cause and severity of your condition. Mild cases may not need any treatment. Treatment can be as simple as making changes to your diet, such as eating less salt to reduce the strain on your kidneys. Medications to lower blood pressure, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, are commonly prescribed for glomerulonephritis because they help protect the kidneys. If the condition is caused by a problem with your immune system, medications called immunosuppressants may be used. Although treatment is effective in many cases, further problems can sometimes develop. These include high blood pressure, damage to other organs, chronic kidney disease and kidney failure. Read more about treating glomerulonephritis and the complications of glomerulonephritis. Information about you If you have glomerulonephritis, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the register. What do our kidneys do?
